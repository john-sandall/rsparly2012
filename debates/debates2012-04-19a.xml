	<p pid="a.484.8/1">I accept that there is an issue for young people, which is why I have taken steps to ensure that young people came along to talk to the operators</p>
	<p pid="a.484.8/2">and local authorities at the bus forum I hold on a six-monthly basis.

	<p pid="a.485.0/1">The Minister will be aware of a recent report from scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which estimated that combustion exhausts cause 5,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. What steps is he taking to make sure that local bus provision is with more efficient buses, and that old buses are retrofitted to improve air quality standards?</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">I am happy to say that we have recently announced the winners of the third round of the green bus fund. Because of our prudent financial management as a Department, we were able to increase it from &#163;20 million to &#163;31 million. We have also provided money to retrofit buses in London to deal with the air pollution problem there. That is a demonstration of the fact that we are committed to bus travel&#8212;both to help create growth and to cut carbon.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.2/1">The Minister&#8217;s new funding pots are like an attempt to use sticking plasters to cover a gaping wound&#8212;the wound inflicted by his decision to cut support for buses by half a billion pounds, which has resulted in not improved but disappearing services. &#8220;The picture is bleak.&#8221; Those are not my words, but the words of the boss of Arriva. Page after page reveals the effect of the Government&#8217;s cuts: &#8220;frequency reduced&#8221;, &#8220;evening and Sunday service withdrawn&#8221;, &#8220;cancelled owing to lack of funding&#8221;.

	<p pid="a.485.3/1">I will not admit it because it is entirely untrue. In fact, those policies have been a success. Recent figures from local authorities show that the average bus mileage is relatively unchanged, which suggests that there have not been the cuts that the Opposition are so keen to talk up. The industry itself has congratulated the Government on their new bus policy, as, indeed, have local authorities. Perhaps the hon. Lady should pay more attention to what the industry and users say, which, by and large, is supportive of what the Government are doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.4/1">According to the Department&#8217;s own figures, traffic volumes will increase by 40% by 2035. Is not the simple, plain fact of the matter that unless we ensure that more people travel on buses, the country will be gridlocked?</p>

	<p pid="a.485.5/1">It is true that we must have a balanced transport policy, and part of that involves maximising the use of public transport. That is why we have invested more in rail travel than any Government since Victorian times, and why we are now investing massively in buses as well. For instance, &#163;70 million has been invested in better bus areas, &#163;41 million in the green bus fund, &#163;560 million in the local sustainable transport fund,</p>

	<p pid="a.486.5/1">The commission&#8217;s report highlights various ways in which local bus markets are not working well enough throughout the United Kingdom and should be improved, but bus operators must be given enough time to prepare for the necessary changes. May I encourage my hon. Friend not to make the same mistake as the Scottish National party Government in Scotland, who have given operators just three months in which to prepare for major structural changes in funding and a 17.5% cut in the bus service operators grant? That is causing chaos in bus services in East Dunbartonshire and elsewhere.</p>

This project has huge cross-party support and support in the business community, although there is concern in some quarters that, because of HS2, we will not get the money for it.

The Government are very aware of the impact that high fuel prices have on people who rely on their cars.

	<p pid="a.491.4/1">I should say that I thank the Secretary of State for that answer, but the problem is that the tax on fuel is not just the excise. There is also a thing called VAT that has not been taken into account in the equation. In her regular meetings with the Chancellor, will the Secretary of State suggest to him that they change the formula for the price of fuel, given that VAT plays a fairly significant part in that and the problem is now at a critical stage in my constituency?

I have spoken with Sir David Higgins of Network Rail and Virgin, and with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport about the timing of the FA cup. It is difficult to change the Network Rail work, which is really important for maintenance and safety and has been planned for 18 months, but Virgin has said that it plans to put on longer trains on the Sunday to ensure that fans have a good opportunity to get back. We all recognise that when the FA cup starts at 5.15 pm and generally the last train back to Liverpool is at 8.10 pm it will always be a stretch for fans to get there.</p>

The increase in unemployment over the past 12 months has been three times higher than the drop in inactivity. With women&#8217;s jobs still being hit hard by Government policies, does the right hon.

	<p pid="a.500.7/1">No, the right hon. Lady is wrong. It is, of course, a concern that so many women are unemployed. That is why the Government are taking very necessary action to help women into the workplace and to set up their own businesses. As I said in response to an earlier</p>
	<p pid="a.500.7/2">question, 61,000 more women are now employed than in May 2010. We are providing real support to women, and that will continue through the changes that we make by introducing universal credit, the changes that will make it easier to access child care and various other proposals that we have put forward. However, our concern about women&#8217;s unemployment does not mean that we cannot welcome an overall fall in unemployment when it takes place.

I am concerned, and constituents and local clergy have also expressed the concern, that, by redefining marriage, we may&#8212;may&#8212;expose churches and other religious institutions to legal challenge and force them to marry gay couples under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2010. Will the Minister give a clear assurance that our churches will not end up in the dock in Strasbourg?</p>

	<p pid="a.503.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his support for equal marriage. When we consider proposed legislation, we will ensure that there is no risk of successful legal challenge against religious organisations that do not marry same-sex couples. It would not be religious organisations, but the United Kingdom Government in the dock in Strasbourg. We respect and understand the concerns of religious organisations, and we want to work closely with them to give them that reassurance. Just as we were able to reassure Members of this House and the House of Lords about civil partnerships being registered on religious premises to the point where they felt that they could let that pass, we will do the same in this case.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.2/1">Yesterday, the European Court of Human Rights informed the Government that, late on Tuesday evening, Abu Qatada applied for a referral of the judgment in his case to the Court&#8217;s Grand Chamber. He did so on the grounds that he would be at risk of torture if he returned to Jordan. The British courts and the European Court have found that, because of the assurances we have received from the Jordanian Government, there is no such risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/2">The Government are clear that Qatada has no right to refer the case to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, since the three-month deadline to do so lapsed at midnight on Monday.&#160;Article 43 of the European convention on human rights explains that a request for referral to the Grand Chamber must be made:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/3">&#8220;Within a period of three months from the date of the judgement of the Chamber&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/4">The letter that communicated the European Court&#8217;s judgement, dated <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-17">17 January</phrase>, confirmed that, saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/5">&#8220;any request for the referral of this judgement to the Grand Chamber must be duly reasoned and reach the Registry within three months of today&#8217;s date.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/6">Therefore, the deadline was midnight, <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-16">Monday 16 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/7">Because the European Court has no automatic mechanism to rule out an application for a referral based on the deadline, Qatada&#8217;s application will be considered by a panel of five judges from the Grand Chamber. They will take into account the deadline, as set out in article 43 of the convention, as part of their consideration. The Government have written to the European Court to make clear our case that the application should be rejected because it is out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/8">The Government believe that the case should be heard instead in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission court, as I outlined in the House of Commons on Tuesday. However, until the panel of the Grand Chamber makes its decision, a Rule 39 injunction preventing the deportation of Abu Qatada remains in place. That means that the deportation process and any potential SIAC appeal is put on hold, but we will resume the process as soon as the injunction is lifted. In the meantime, we will continue to build our case, based on the assurances and information we have received from the Jordanian Government. Abu Qatada remains in detention, and the Government will resist vigorously any application he might make to be released on bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/9">As I said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, despite the progress we have made, the process of deporting Qatada is likely to take many months. The fact that he is trying to delay that process by applying for a referral to the Grand Chamber after the deadline has passed, and after he has heard our case in SIAC, is evidence of the</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/10">strength of our arguments, the weakness of his, and the likelihood of our eventual success in removing him from Britain for good.</p>

Yesterday, the Home Office said the appeal deadline was Monday night, but European Court officials said it was Tuesday night.

	<p pid="a.508.4/1">This farce has serious consequences: additional delays, a greater risk that Abu Qatada will be put out on bail and a risk he will sue the Government. Did the Home Office get specific assurances from the European Court that the deadline was Monday night? If so, will it publish them? If not, why not? Why did it not pick up the phone to sort it out? The Home Office was told by journalists on Monday, nearly 24 hours before Abu Qatada was arrested, that European Court officials were saying that the deadline was Tuesday. Did it do anything about it?</p>
	<p pid="a.508.4/2">I hope that the Home Secretary&#8217;s interpretation is right, but at best there is uncertainty, and several eminent lawyers now say that they agree with the European Court. So why take the risk? What was the harm in waiting until Wednesday? Why create a legal loophole for Abu Qatada&#8217;s lawyers to exploit? We all want Abu Qatada deported as soon as possible, under the rule of law, and kept off the streets in the meantime, but both those things are now less likely because of her actions. On Tuesday, I warned that there was a troubling level of confusion around this case, but even I did not imagine that the confusion was this great. When will she sort this out?</p>

	<p pid="a.509.0/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me repeat what I said in my first answer. We have always been clear that despite the progress we have made, the process of deporting Abu Qatada is likely to take many months. It should hardly come as a surprise to anybody that he intended to apply delaying tactics&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I repeat that it should hardly come as a surprise to anybody that Abu Qatada has chosen to use delaying tactics. After all, he has been doing this since 2001. The fact that he applied to the Grand Chamber for referral after the deadline had passed and after he had heard our case in SIAC shows the strength of our arguments and of our work in putting together assurances from the Grand Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/2">I answered the question about dates in my first answer, but I will return to the matter because the right hon. Lady referred to it again. Article 43 of the convention makes it clear that a request for referral to the Grand Chamber must be made</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/3">&#8220;within a period of three months from the date of the judgement of the Chamber&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/4">I shall read out the European Court&#8217;s own guidance:</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/5">&#8220;the period of three months within which referral may be requested starts to run on the date of the delivery of the judgment, irrespective of whether the party concerned may have learned about it at a later stage. It expires three calendar months later and is not interrupted by bank holidays or periods of judicial recess. The request for referral should reach the Registry of the Court before the expiry of the above-mentioned period.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/6">We are talking about a simple mathematical question. The European Court&#8217;s judgment was on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-17">17 January</phrase>. The period of three months within which we were allowed to refer ended at midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-16">16 April</phrase>. The right hon. Lady asked why we did not just call the European Court and check. Of course, the Government have been in contact with the Court throughout this period, and it was always clear that we were working to the Monday deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/7">The shadow Home Secretary quoted a source in the European Court, but if she had listened to what I said in my first answer, she would know that the only people at the European Court who can adjudicate on this matter are the judges on the panel of the Grand Chamber. Article 43 is very clear. She may want to listen to unofficial sources, but I suggest that she reads the text of the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/8">The shadow Home Secretary also chose to attack me today for acting too quickly in this matter. On Tuesday she attacked me for acting too slowly in this matter. She is all over the place. The truth is that because of the work that we have done, we have the assurances and information that we need from the Jordanian Government to comply with the January ruling of the European Court. Once we can get the case back to the British courts, we will resume that process, so that we can put Abu Qatada on a plane and get him out of our country for good. That is something that the shadow Home Secretary should support.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/9">Finally, perhaps the shadow Home Secretary can answer the question that was not answered on Tuesday. While we are talking about deportation and extradition, why is the Labour party campaigning to stop the extradition of a known terror suspect to the United States?</p>

Mr Abu Qatada was first arrested in 2002, and was then released and re-arrested on two separate occasions over an eight-year period.

	<p pid="a.511.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to bring us back to the core issue that is at stake here. The fact is that, for the past 11 years, this country has been trying to deport Abu Qatada to Jordan. As far as I, the Government, the British public and, I hope, the whole House are concerned, that is what should happen to him. On Tuesday, when the Government had their first opportunity to take action to resume that deportation, that is exactly what we did.</p>

I think that, if she had half a chance, she would like to be handcuffed to Abu Qatada on a plane to Jordan in order to deposit him in Amman. What concerns me, however, is the fact that a north London firm of legal aid solicitors has been able to outwit the very expensive silks of the Home Office. She mentioned article 43. If she looks at the cases of Praha <i>v.</i> the Czech Republic and Otto <i>v. </i>Germany, she will see that the time limit begins the next day. I am also worried about the 15 other cases that she referred to on Tuesday. Will she look at those cases and ensure that proper legal advice has been taken and that deadlines have been met? When she comes before the Select Committee next Tuesday, it would be good if she could give us the answers to those questions.</p>

The arbiters of whether a request for a referral put in by Abu Qatada should be accepted&#8212;whether in response to a deadline or, as we believe, outside the deadline&#8212;or whether discretion should be applied to accept it outside the deadline are not a north London firm of lawyers but the five judges who will be sitting on the panel of the Grand Chamber of the European Court.</p>

Will it be tighter than her proposed terrorism prevention and investigation measures, and if it is a tighter regime, why is it appropriate for him and not for the other terrorist suspects to whom she is planning to grant the freedom of the capital city?</p>

	<p pid="a.514.1/1">I have answered questions about the European Court, the treaty and the advice and guidance given by the European Court on the dates. On the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s final point, Abu Qatada is in detention at the moment. If he and his lawyers apply for him to be let him out on bail, we will vigorously oppose it. It is the case, of course, that he had been on bail prior to his arrest on Tuesday. The bail conditions on which he was held were among the most stringent ever applied to anybody here in the United Kingdom. Those bail conditions were tighter than the control order regime that I know the right hon. Gentleman supported.</p>

As I am sure my hon. Friend will be aware, if the Government were to take action to break that injunction, not only would that be contrary to that legal judgment made by the European Court, but the first step would be to ask for an injunction here in the UK courts.

She has repeatedly said she is clear that the deadline was <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-16">16 April</phrase>. She has not said, however, whether she was made aware that there could be uncertainty about that in the European Court. Was she made aware of that?</p>

	<p pid="a.522.8/1">Exactly. The point is that, as I said earlier, this comes as no surprise, as I think everybody would expect Abu Qatada and his lawyers to use whatever delaying tactics they can. As I have made absolutely clear, it is within the discretion of the panel of the Grand Chamber of the European Court to decide to accept a referral that is outside the deadline, so it is little wonder that Abu Qatada and his lawyers have made this attempt at a referral.</p>

	<p pid="a.526.3/1">I not only thank the Leader of the House for his statement and congratulate the new Serjeant at Arms on his appointment, but pay tribute to the former Leader of the House, Tony Newton, who has sadly died.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/2">Four weeks ago, the Chancellor made one of his rare appearances at the Dispatch Box to present his Budget, and it has gone down so brilliantly that the Leader of the House is going to find it even more difficult to coax the Chancellor out of hiding and back to the Dispatch Box any time soon. It takes a unique combination of political skills, which only this Chancellor possesses, to unite pie and pasty makers, Church and charity leaders, philanthropists, university vice-chancellors and caravan owners. The Chancellor&#8217;s magic touch has now extended to his own Back Benches, because last night nearly 10% of the Conservative parliamentary party voted against their own Government on the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/3">It is not just the Budget that this Chancellor has bungled. He has made the wrong choices on the economy and the Government have no strategy for growth. While ordinary families are being hammered by soaring fuel, food and housing costs, this part-time Chancellor has chosen to give a huge tax cut to the richest 1%.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/4">One of the first acts of the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport on coming to office was to give a speech on philanthropy. In it, he announced that the Government would be</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/5">&#8220;reviewing what it can do to encourage philanthropy across the board&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/6">You have to say, Mr Speaker, that they have come up with a very novel way of doing it. The Culture Secretary briefed that the Budget process was such a shambles that the Chancellor did not bother speaking to him about the charities tax, and presumably he did not know about the churches tax either. Will the Culture Secretary come to this House and make a statement on that debacle?</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/7">Following on from the shambolic Budget, yesterday the Government forced through a tax cut for the richest 1%. Last November, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40528" name="Nicholas Clegg">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr Clegg)</phrase>, the Liberal Democrat leader, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/8">&#8220;It would be utterly incomprehensible for millions of people who work hard...if suddenly the priority is to give 300,000 people at the very, very top a tax break&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/9">If it was utterly incomprehensible then, why have Liberal Democrats voted for it now? Will the Leader of the House coax the Deputy Prime Minister to the Dispatch Box to explain his damascene conversion to the interests of the top 1%?</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/10">Do the Liberal Democrats seriously think they can get away with agreeing a policy round the Cabinet table, denouncing it in the media, and then voting for it in the House? It is not just on the Budget that they have tried that trick. As the Prime Minister pointed out while on his most recent world tour, the Liberal Democrat leader secretly signed off the policy on internet surveillance in Government and then, when details appeared in the papers, he publically denounced it. A pattern is emerging. Judging by his track record, the Deputy Prime Minster will now ensure that Liberal Democrats vote for the measure while he blames the Tories for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/11">Perhaps the Liberal Democrat leader could explain this leaflet, which the party has just put out in Cornwall. It states &#8220;Stop the Tories Taxing Our Pasties!&#8221; Just five Liberal Democrat MPs voted for Labour&#8217;s amendment, and analysis of last night&#8217;s result reveals that it was Liberal Democrat votes what won the pasty tax for the Government. May we have a statement on this desperate effort to hoodwink the public? People are not fooled by the Liberal Democrats&#8217; dubious political posturing. The pasty tax, the caravan tax and the churches tax were all voted through the House last night because of Liberal Democrat support.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/12">The part-time Chancellor&#8217;s shambolic handling of the Budget is matched by the Home Secretary&#8217;s increasingly chaotic attempts to deport Abu Qatada. On the interpretation of time limits, I have to ask, why did no one in the Home Office think to phone up the European Court to check when it thought that the deadline was at an end?</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/13">This parliamentary Session is finally staggering to a close, ending a spectacularly mismanaged legislative programme with a spectacularly mismanaged Budget, and we have already started to have leaks about the content of the next Queen&#8217;s Speech. The entire Budget was leaked, but the content of the Queen&#8217;s Speech should not be briefed to the media before Her Majesty has delivered it.</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/14">In his statement, the Leader of the House referred to all the time he has allowed for consideration of Lords amendments next week, but will he take this opportunity to deny rumours that the House will rise much earlier than he is planning?</p>
	<p pid="a.526.3/15">In an interview this week, the chair of the Conservative party tried to explain away what she herself described as the Government&#8217;s &#8220;incoherence&#8221; with two words &#8220;Liberal Democrats&#8221;. Can the Leader of the House tell us what on earth she could have meant?</p>

	<p pid="a.528.0/1">I begin by thanking the hon. Lady for her kind words about Tony Newton, whose funeral I attended last week, where I listened to some generous tributes from John Major and John MacGregor. It was a very well attended and moving funeral.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.0/2">Let me move on to the hon. Lady&#8217;s questions. Most of them related to the Budget; I gently point out to her that we are debating the Budget for the whole of this week and that this time is for questions about next week&#8217;s business. All the issues she raised have been the subject of a debate this week or will be the subject of a debate later today. Let me also gently remind the hon. Lady about Budget rebellions. Three weeks ago, an amendment was tabled to the Budget opposing the cut to the 50p tax rate. In other words, it was an amendment that would have implemented the Labour party&#8217;s policy. When there was a vote, only two Labour Members voted for it: the hon. Members for Bolsover (Mr Skinner) and for Newport West (Paul Flynn). They were the only two Members who supported the official Labour party policy. Everyone else, including the hon. Lady, rebelled, so I will take no lectures from her on rebellions on Budget measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.0/3">The hon. Lady raised some points about taxation. She did not mention the 2 million people we are taking out of tax or the 24 million taxpayers who will benefit from the changes we have made. As she knows, the better-off will pay five times more in extra tax than they will get from the reduction in the rate from 50p to 45p.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.0/4">On the subject of Qatada, we have just had a whole hour of exchanges on Qatada and I hope that the hon. Lady&#8217;s colleagues have raised all the questions on that subject that could possibly be raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.0/5">On the legislative Session, I gently remind the hon. Lady that, unlike during the previous Session under the previous Government, we have not rushed through Bills with guillotine after guillotine. We have consistently allowed two days on Report for several Bills, many programme motions have been supported by the Labour party&#8212;all credit to Labour for coming to a sensible accommodation&#8212;and we have had adequate discussion. I remember the hon. Lady saying that we would not get all the Bills through, but we are getting them all through, with adequate time.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.0/6">On the hon. Lady&#8217;s final question, I have announced that the House will be sitting the week after next and I have announced the business for the Monday. She will understand that at this stage in the parliamentary Session, with four Bills still in play between the two Houses, it is impossible to forecast exactly when the House will prorogue. I anticipate that it will be some time the week after next.</p>

	<p pid="a.528.1/1">Can the Leader of the House say when the parliamentary business committee will be established so that all the issues with</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/2">programming motions can go? That would offer the opportunity of taking control of business away from the Executive and back to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.529.0/1">As my hon. Friend will know, the Backbench Business Committee has been established and elections will take place at the beginning of the next Session. He will know of the commitment in the coalition agreement to introduce a committee to deal with Government business by the third year, which ends in about a year&#8217;s time and so, as my hon. Friend will understand, we have 12 months to honour that commitment. I plan to honour it.</p>

	<p pid="a.529.1/1">On Tuesday, the Backbench Business Committee met for the last time this Session&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Aah!] I see the grief on the Chief Whip&#8217;s face. As the Leader of the House announced, Thursday is the last debate this Session from the Backbench Business Committee in Westminster Hall, where we will be launching our end-of-term report with a mini-statement, in which I hope all Members will participate. Will the Leader of the House ensure that all political parties elect new members to the Backbench Business Committee as a matter of urgency when we return to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-09">9 May</phrase>? Until that Committee is reconstituted no further debates can be scheduled, so I encourage the Leader of the House to encourage all political parties, especially his own, to ensure that members are elected as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.529.2/1">I take this opportunity to compliment the hon. Lady on her chairmanship of the Backbench Business Committee during its first two years. As she has just said, it has met for the last time. I have no idea whether she is going to stand again as Chair and the last thing she would want would be any endorsement from business managers of her candidacy, but I hope that if she stands, the House will take on board her record of leadership over the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.2/2">Speaking for the two coalition parties, I can say that we plan to proceed as quickly as possible at the beginning of the next Session with the election of our members of the Backbench Business Committee, and I am sure that the shadow Leader of the House will ensure that her party does the same. The Government want to see the Committee up and running as soon as possible and we will do all we can to facilitate it. I commend the hon. Lady on her public service announcement about the launch of her report in Westminster Hall next week and I very much hope to be in my place for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.529.3/1">The people of Hay-on-Wye in my constituency are twinned with the people of Timbuktu in Mali, where they carry on many good projects involving health, education and agriculture. They are now concerned about the well-being of their friends in that trouble-torn country. Will the Leader of the House either make time available for a debate or ask the Foreign Secretary to come to the House and make an oral statement so that we can ascertain what is happening in that country and to our embassy there?</p>

	<p pid="a.530.0/1">I understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s concern, particularly because of the links between his constituency and Timbuktu. We had an opportunity on Tuesday in Foreign and Commonwealth Office questions for those concerns to be ventilated, but I will ask the Foreign Secretary to write to my hon. Friend and give him up-to-date information, particularly about any impact on British citizens in that country.</p>

	<p pid="a.530.1/1">The whole House will be aware of the courage and commitment to democracy of the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Is the Leader of the House able to make a statement about her visit to the UK? Perhaps he might agree with me that an invitation to address both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall would be a fitting tribute to her and a very great honour to us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.530.2/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Lady&#8217;s comments. As she knows, the Prime Minister extended to Aung San Suu Kyi an invitation to visit this country and I have seen reports, which I welcome if they are true, that she plans to spend some time in Oxford where she used to live. I suspect that the question of an address in Westminster Hall is above my pay grade, but I will ensure that it goes to the relevant authorities for serious consideration in view of her record on human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.530.3/1">It is more than 20 years since the landmark Medical Research Council study that showed that the fortification of foodstuffs with folic acid taken prior to conception would reduce neural tube defects such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Many countries have pursued that policy, but there is an impasse in our country between the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, the Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health. May we have a debate in Government time to ensure that we properly debate this matter and follow the lead of other countries to reduce the incidence of these dreadful medical conditions?</p>

	<p pid="a.531.0/1">My understanding is that the Foreign Office has given no specific advice that people should not travel to Bahrain. The Formula 1 event is a matter for the Bahraini authorities and the FIA organisers.

I hope we can have a debate about the case and about the abuse of diplomatic immunity, because if the attach&#233; is allowed to leave without being questioned, that will undermine Britain&#8217;s proud reputation for not tolerating war criminals.

	<p pid="a.536.4/1">The coalition Government are in favour of philanthropy and we have taken a number of steps to promote it. We have made changes to the inheritance tax regime, we have proposals for small donations so that tax can be claimed back, and we are streamlining the mechanism by which charities reclaim tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.4/2">On the specific measure to which the hon. Gentleman refers, he will know that we are having discussions with the charitable sector to seek to protect it from any damaging changes in the proposals that have been</p>
	<p pid="a.536.4/3">announced, which come into effect in a year&#8217;s time. There is a serious issue as to whether those on high incomes, who have philanthropic objectives, should be able to exempt themselves from income tax by making substantial donations. In America, which has a good culture, there is a cap on relief, so there is nothing inherently anti-philanthropic in ensuring that those who have high incomes make some contribution to the overheads of the country through income tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.541.2/1">We would welcome such a debate. We had one in February when the House debated the revenue support grant&#8212;it is an annual debate&#8212;and those points were forcibly made. As in many parts of the country, when people decide how to vote in local elections I am sure that they will remember the Government&#8217;s benevolent treatment of council tax payers and the way we sought to protect them from the pressures on household budgets by enabling many local authorities to freeze council tax for two years running.</p>

	<p pid="a.541.3/1">There has recently been wide media coverage by the television programme &#8220;Watchdog&#8221;, <i>Private Eye</i> and others of rip-off private car park operators.

	<p pid="a.541.4/1">My recollection is that we have banned the clamping of motor vehicles, which I think is now an offence. I hope that that will reduce to some extent the grievances to which the hon. Gentleman refers. If he has in mind any other changes to the legislation, perhaps he will be good enough to let me or my hon. Friends know and we will certainly look at them. We must get the balance right between, on the one hand, those who own property that they do not want to operate as free car parks and, on the other hand, motorists who are legitimately looking for somewhere to park their cars while they go about their business. I hope that we have the right balance, but if he has any proposals we will of course look at them.</p>

	<p pid="a.541.5/1">May we please have a statement on buses? The Leader of the House might have noticed the great interest in buses during Transport questions this morning, which was far higher</p>
	<p pid="a.541.5/2">than usual, following the publication on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-26">26 March</phrase> of the Government&#8217;s paper, &#8220;Green Light for Better Buses&#8221;, which I dare say is the most wide-ranging policy on buses we have seen since the Leader of the House was in the Department for Transport. Why did a Minister not make a statement to the House at that time?</p>

	<p pid="a.542.0/1">There is always pressure on Government time and we have to balance the House&#8217;s appetite for statements with the business before the House on a particular day, which is why we sometimes make written ministerial statements rather than oral ones. If my hon. Friend looks at the Government&#8217;s record, he will find that we have made more statements than our predecessors. Ultimately, it is a question of balance; a statement, which can last an hour, squeezes the subsequent debate, and if it is an Opposition day there are sometimes protests from Opposition Members. We try to get the balance right, but not every Government announcement scores an oral statement in the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.542.1/2" class="italic">[That this House is concerned about press reports that UK Olympians will be asked to wear sporting equipment produced by exploited child labour; is further concerned that successful Olympians will be presented with medals produced by multi-national company Rio Tinto who have locked out their entire workforce in Alma, Quebec without any serious consultation; and, therefore calls on the Government and the Olympics governing body to ensure that ethical trading standards will be maintained during a hopefully successful Olympics in the UK.]</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/3">Recent press reports suggest that exploited child labour is being used to make the sports equipment used by UK athletes, and now we hear that the company producing the gold medals, Rio Tinto, has locked out its entire work force since December last year. If we are to have a successful Olympics&#8212;we all hope that we will&#8212;ethical standards must be maintained by all involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.542.2/1">I endorse what the hon. Gentleman has said. Of course we should maintain high ethical standards. Like him, I want the Olympic games to be a great success. I will raise with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games the two issues that he has raised about the medals and the possible use of child labour, and ask Lord Coe to write to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.542.3/1">May we have a statement on which councils are providing value for money for taxpayers? Harlow&#8217;s Conservative council has frozen council tax not just for one or two years, but for the past three years, and has protected discretionary services. Does that not show that Conservative councils cost taxpayers less?</p>

	<p pid="a.542.4/1">The short answer is yes. Perhaps I should not develop that too much, in view of what I said earlier about my Liberal Democrat friends. Under the last Labour Government, council tax doubled across England. This Government have worked with councils to freeze council tax for two years. I applaud what has</p>
	<p pid="a.542.4/2">happened in Harlow, where the council anticipated that policy by freezing council tax for a third year. Those who have an opportunity to vote next month must cast their votes according to the record to which my hon. Friend has referred.</p>

	<p pid="a.543.0/1">Cleveland has seen a 1.2% rise in crime this week and has lost 224 police officers since May 2010, and yet the Home Secretary has never visited the north-east region to see the effects of her cuts. Can we have a debate on rising crime in the north-east, which is due to the Government&#8217;s cuts to front-line police?</p>

	<p pid="a.543.1/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman makes a mistake in drawing a direct correlation between the volume of crime and the number of police officers; it is a much more subtle equation than he implies. He will know that in many parts of the country, police authorities have coped with the challenging budgets without reducing the front-line effectiveness of the police force. I will see whether Home Office Ministers are able to visit the north-east to see at first hand what is going on. I hope that the police authority will respond to the challenge and maintain front-line effectiveness, as has happened in other parts of the country.</p>

The latest figures show that almost 400,000 primary school pupils are absent for 15% of the school year or more, which is equivalent to a month out of school.

He may have seen Charlie Taylor&#8217;s report, which was published on Monday, and the accompanying written ministerial statement, which supported the report and stated which measures would be taken forward. I agree that attendance at school is a key factor in driving up levels of achievement. We need to change the culture whereby it is acceptable regularly to take family holidays during the school year. We also need better statistics on truancy, which was another of the recommendations. I would welcome such a debate, but my hon. Friend may have to contain himself until the new Session.</p>

	<p pid="a.546.9/1">It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Primarolo.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.9/2">I rise to speak to the amendments and to oppose clause 4, which will freeze age-related allowances for those who are receiving them and abolish them for those who are approaching retirement. I hope that Members from all parts of the Committee will join us in our opposition this afternoon. Defeating the clause would prevent a real-terms increase in tax for millions of older people in this country, which will cost &#163;83 a</p>
	<p pid="a.546.9/3">year for 4.4 million people on modest incomes and as a much as &#163;322 for 360,000 people who will reach the age of 65 next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.546.9/4">We are seeking to reverse the Government&#8217;s freezing and abolition of age-related allowance for three simple reasons: first, that tax increase adds to the financial pressure already felt by older people on modest incomes facing rising costs; secondly, it picks the pockets of pensioners to fund an irresponsible tax cut for millionaires; and thirdly, the way in which it has been introduced adds insult to injury, breaking a promise made by the Chancellor just a year ago and using the language of tax simplification to cover up what is clearly and simply a tax grab.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.3/1">I will make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.3/2">For the reasons that I have given, pensioners from the National Pensioners Convention have come to Parliament today to lobby MPs to vote against the change. Let us take each issue in turn and consider who will be hit, because there has been some myth making by defenders of the granny tax about how only well-off pensioners will be affected. The truth is, those who will be hit have very modest incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.4/1">The hon. Lady refers to the &#8220;granny tax&#8221;. I know that she, like me, would really like to see older women retiring with the same income as men over time. Does she therefore accept that 60% of the effect of the freezing of the age-related allowance will be on men and 40% on women, so it should not really be referred as a granny tax?</p>

	<p pid="a.547.5/1">The money involved will not alleviate the pressure on women in retirement. It will all be used to give a tax cut of &#163;40,000 to 14,000 millionaires. The hon. Lady talks about women in retirement, and it was Government Members who voted to increase the state pension age for women with just five or six years&#8217; notice, hitting them by up to &#163;15,000 in lost retirement income. We will not take any lectures from them about the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.547.6/1">I notice that we have not heard much about fairness or about the big tax cuts being given to millionaires in the interventions by Government Members. Is it not true those retiring next year with personal or occupational pensions of as low as &#163;67 a week could be affected by the change to age-related allowance? The Government are attacking a group of pensioners with modest incomes, which will be a particularly devastating blow in the most deprived areas such as Halton.</p>

	<p pid="a.548.0/1">I know that my hon. Friend sticks up for pensioners in his constituency, unlike Government Members, who want to grab the incomes of pensioners in their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.548.0/2">My hon. Friend points out the evidence that we have commissioned from the House of Commons Library, which shows that a small personal or occupational pension of just &#163;67 a week, or little more than &#163;3,000 a year, would be enough to put someone in the firing line of the additional tax. People with such pensions are not the privileged few, living a life of luxury in retirement. The measure will hit millions of people who have worked hard in ordinary jobs and managed to set aside just enough to give them a small pension that relieves them of reliance on means-tested benefits and allows them to have some security in retirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.548.2/1">If they were being taxed at 20%, that would mean tax of about &#163;13 a week on their pension. Such pensioners will be hit hard by the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/2">We know how hard it already is for many people to save enough for a modest pension, so why have the Government picked on pensioners to pay more? As the chief executive of Saga has put it:</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/3">&#8220;Amid all the talk of tax cuts&#8230;the main tax-raising measure&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/4">in the Budget</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/5">&#8220;consisted of a stealth tax increase on older people who did actually work and save hard for their future.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/6">Gransnet has warned that</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/7">&#8220;this tax change offers no incentive to save&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/8">and the National Association of Pension Funds has stated that it will</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/9">&#8220;come as a blow to millions of pensioners who have paid in to the tax system throughout their working lives. Pensioners with modest amounts of pension saving stand to be the biggest losers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.548.2/10">Let us be clear that the change will hit people with small pensions who have made sacrifices to save and are now being penalised for doing the right thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.548.4/1">The people who will be hit by this tax are those who have an income in retirement of between &#163;10,500 and &#163;25,000 a year. They will pay tax at 20% on any income over &#163;10,500 a year. That is why 4.4 million pensioners will lose out by an average of &#163;83 next year. People retiring next year will lose out by up to &#163;322. That is the reality of the change that we will vote on this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman. His constituents have had a hard time in the past few days. Older people will be hit by the changes to pensioners&#8217; tax allowances, and of course the pasty industry in Cornwall and the south-east will be hit hard, so there is a double hit for his region.</p>
	<p pid="a.549.5/2">We need to remember the situation that most pensioners face. They do not have ways of making up for a loss of income by going out and finding work. That is what it means to be retired. They are therefore particularly vulnerable to rises in the cost of living and to unanticipated changes in their financial circumstances. The Office of Tax Simplification report notes that the current age-related allowance was</p>
	<p pid="a.549.5/3">&#8220;introduced to reflect potentially higher costs of living of older people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.549.5/4">That was why Winston Churchill introduced it in 1925. As the OTS has stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.549.5/5">&#8220;Older people can struggle to meet living costs. They are often on a fixed income once they have retired, or perhaps on a declining income in real terms where flat annuities have been purchased&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.549.6/1">I understand that one reason why the age-related allowance was originally introduced was the higher cost of heating when people are older. Does my hon.

	<p pid="a.549.8/1">I am enjoying my hon. Friend&#8217;s speech, and she is being extremely generous in allowing hon. Members of all parties to intervene. To continue her point, pensioners now face an increase in the cost of not only gas and electricity, but of a decent, healthy meal that will sustain them. As people get older and more frail, they need to ensure that they eat proper, decent, balanced meals. Costs are going through the roof all the time and</p>

	<p pid="a.550.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. Indeed, Citizens Advice said that the change</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/2">&#8220;has to be considered in terms of the cumulative impact. Fuel prices continue to rise, and that is a key worry; 43% of the people who come to us are worried that they will not be able to meet their fuel bills. We have examples of people coming into our bureaux who do not heat their homes because they are worried about not being able to afford it... This group of people very often have to rely on their savings in order to live in their retirement, and they are getting very low interest on them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/3">My hon. Friends have therefore made good points, which represent their constituents&#8217; very real concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.550.0/4">Moreover, pensioners have already been hit hard by the Government. The winter fuel allowance has been cut; pensions have been indexed to a lower measure of inflation; the raising of the state pension age for women has been brought forward, and last year&#8217;s VAT rise has added &#163;275 to the costs that an average pensioner couple faces. Evidence from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the Treasury Committee confirms that, as a result of the tax and benefit changes that the Government have implemented, the incomes of pensioner households have fallen by 1.4%, and most have little prospect or opportunity of making up that loss.</p>

	<p pid="a.550.2/1">We do not know what the economy will look like in three weeks, let alone in three years. The Government&#8217;s choices are making our economic prospects worse and worse. In the past year, the Office for Budget Responsibility has had to revise down its forecast for UK growth three times. It is now expected to be a third less than it was a year ago. We will publish our manifesto before the next election, but it will be very different from Government Members&#8217; manifestos because we prioritise hard-working families, not a tax cut of &#163;40,000 for 14,000 millionaires. That is why we will vote against the provision this evening.</p>

She will know that we have introduced a triple lock so that the state pension increases by the higher of 2.5%, CPI or earnings. She will also know that, according to the plans we inherited, pensions would rise in line with earnings. As a consequence of the increases by CPI rather than earnings, the state pension has increased by &#163;127 more a year than it would have done under the plans that we inherited.

	<p pid="a.550.4/1">Not many Governments would want to take credit for the fact that inflation has reached 5.3%.

The Government increased VAT and took no action to tackle excessive gas and electricity bills, and that is why inflation is so high for ordinary working families and pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.551.3/1">No. Cuts to vital services such as the NHS and to social care and local transport also hit pensioners hard on top of the increases in VAT and the cuts to their pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.3/2">Many of the worst cuts are still to come. Analysis of the 2010 spending review showed that, on average, pensioner couples would be hit hard by cuts to services, amounting to &#163;1,275 a year or 6% of their household income, while single pensioners stood to lose services worth &#163;1,300 a year or 11% of their income. As we heard from the Treasury Committee yesterday, many pensioners are also paying a price for the Government&#8217;s failure to get the economy moving because the Government are relying on the Bank of England to undertake more quantitative easing to prevent the economy from sinking deeper into recession. That means that annuity rates and returns on pensioners&#8217; savings are lower than they would otherwise be.</p>

	<p pid="a.551.4/1">The hon. Lady referred to the increase in the pensioners&#8217; allowance and linked it to inflation. How high would the Labour Government have moved it in the current circumstances of inflation? How would they have paid for that with council tax rises elsewhere?</p>

	<p pid="a.551.5/1">I return to my earlier point: if inflation was 10% and pensioners got a &#163;10 increase in their pension, would Government Members celebrate and say that that was huge largesse for pensioners? It is not; it just keeps pace with the cost of living. The increase in VAT, and the increases in gas and electricity prices, which the Government have done nothing to tackle, and the rise in petrol prices, mean that the cost of living for pensioners and other families has increased enormously because of the Government&#8217;s choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.5/2">There is a further hit to pensioners&#8217; incomes, buried in the detail of the Budget documents. This year, an estimated 300,000 pensioners stand to lose their savings credit, while others stand to lose as much as &#163;276 a year as a result of reduced rates of savings credit. Under the Chancellor&#8217;s latest plans, the savings credit will be abolished completely, costing more than 100,000 new pensioners as much as &#163;897 a year: another stealth tax that the Chancellor tried to slip past pensioners; another slice taken from the constrained budgets of ordinary families.</p>

	<p pid="a.552.0/2">It adds insult to injury for the Prime Minister and other Government Members to tell pensioners that they should be grateful for a rise in the basic state pension that merely matches the rate of inflation. It is not a rise&#8212;it simply keeps things level. If Government Members do not know the difference, they should get out into the real world, where the costs of food and fuel are going up and it is getting harder and harder to make ends meet.</p>

	<p pid="a.553.3/1">Winston Churchill was right in 1925 when he introduced that measure. People who are retired have fixed incomes, as a result of which there are more pressures on them and they cannot make up the additional changes. That is why the Opposition will vote against the Government&#8217;s change. We do not think it is the right priority or the right thing to do at this time, especially because the money is not being used to help young people to get back to work, to help the poorest pensioners or to help families of children who are struggling with the rise in the cost of living. Instead, the money is being used to give a tax cut of &#163;40,000 to 14,000 millionaires. I can tell the hon. Gentleman what my principle is: we should prioritise ordinary families, ordinary pensioners and young people who are out of work, not those on multi-million pound salaries. That is my principle and those are my priorities. I am sorry that Government Members do not share them.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/2">That is the second reason why the Opposition are opposing the tax increase on millions of modest-income pensioners. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40482" name="Owen Smith">the Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith)</phrase> so eloquently expressed on Monday, the measure is unfair and unnecessary when the Government are spending &#163;3 billion on a tax give-away for the richest 1%. Hon. Members will remember that, originally, the Government said that the 50p tax cut would be paid for by a mansion tax and a crackdown on tax avoidance. However, the cut costs 10 times as much as is raised by the new measure on stamp duty&#8212;the Chief Secretary&#8217;s sorry substitute for a mansion tax&#8212;and more than three times as much as is raised in the Budget by reductions in tax avoidance. In fact, cutting tax avoidance should be part of every Budget anyway, and the money raised by measures to tackle tax avoidance in this Budget is less than the average reductions in tax avoidance achieved by Labour&#8217;s Budgets. In addition, we have since discovered that the Government&#8217;s definition of tax avoidance includes donations to UNICEF, Macmillan, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and other charities that do fantastic work in our communities. That the Government cannot see the difference between tax avoidance and giving money to worthwhile causes again shows how out of touch they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/3">Meanwhile, the single biggest revenue raiser in the Budget is the measure before us. More than &#163;3 billion over the next five years will be raised from the pockets</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/4">of pensioners with modest incomes. Where does it all go to? Does it go towards paying down the deficit? No. Does it help young people to get back to work? No. Does it help poorer pensioners? No&#8212;they have been hit too by VAT rises and service cuts. Instead, the money, which is being taken from those with pensions of just a few thousand pounds a year, is being spent on a tax cut for people for whom this tax grab would have counted as mere small change.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/5">The Government were said to have been surprised by the anger that the measure has aroused, but that again goes to show how out of touch they are with the reality faced by most people, and how far they have strayed from the values and priorities of the British people. It goes to the heart of the problems that the Government face and the problem with their conception of fairness, and the callous arrogance with which they have abandoned the pretence that we are all in it together.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/6">Age UK responded to the Government&#8217;s measures by stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/7">&#8220;we feel it is disappointing that the Budget offered a tax break of at least &#163;10,000 to the very wealthy while penalising many pensioners on fairly modest incomes who are already being squeezed&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/8">The chief executive of Saga said:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/9">&#8220;Over the next five years, pensioners with an income of between &#163;10,500 and &#163;24,000 will be paying an extra &#163;3 billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/10">The National Pensioners Convention, which I met earlier today, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/11">&#8220;We have been inundated by pensioners who are disgusted that those on around &#163;11,000 a year will no longer get additional reductions in their tax&#8230;whilst those earning &#163;150,000 or more will see their tax bills reduced. This is seen by many as the last straw&#8230;Pensioners feel they are being asked to bail out the super rich&#8230;and it&#8217;s simply not fair.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/12">Age UK, Saga, and the National Pensioners Convention have hit the nail on the head. It is just a shame that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister are so blinded by the demands of the super-rich that they fail to see it.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/13">Finally, it is worth recognising that the measure is not the only reason why people are so angry. It is not just the blatant unfairness that has offended people, but the way in which the change was announced. Most people believe that our older generation deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, yet this Government and the Chancellor tried to get away with going back on a previous promise by dressing up a tax grab as a &#8220;simplification&#8221;. Just one year ago, on page 35 of the 2011 Budget Red Book, people were told:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/14">&#8220;For the duration of this Parliament&#8230;the age related allowance will be over-indexed&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/15">according to</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/16">&#8220;CPI and will increase by the equivalent of the&#8230;RPI&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/17">What the Chancellor said then was clear and unmistakeable, but that is another broken promise by the Conservatives and their Liberal Democrat friends. The Institute for Fiscal Studies agrees. It says that the Chancellor</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/18">&#8220;should have avoided dressing up what is clearly a tax increase as merely a simplification&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/19">In the same letter from Age UK to the Chancellor that I have quoted, it also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/20">&#8220;We are concerned that you announced the change to age allowances as a way to simplify the tax system and indeed the Budget Report lists the change under&#8230;&#8216;Simplification&#8217;... rather than under &#8216;Personal and Property taxes&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/21">The Chancellor also attempted to hide behind the Office of Tax Simplification, but its director has told the Treasury that attempts to use its recommendations as a cover for his tax grab are &#8220;not 100% accurate&#8221;. The relevant report by the Office of Tax Simplification states clearly:</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/22">&#8220;we would stress&#8230;that the Office of Tax Simplification has not reached any conclusions as to the best way forward with age-related allowances, nor have we formulated detailed recommendations&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/23">It is all too clear why the Chancellor did not bother to wait for the final OTS report: he was not really interested in simplifying taxation for older people. Rather, his single-minded focus and overriding priority was getting his millionaires&#8217; tax break through, and he was willing to fund it by cutting the incomes of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/24">In conclusion, we all know what an embarrassment this Budget has become to Government Members. We know how it has shaken their confidence in the strategic genius of the Chancellor and that many of them have heard from constituents who are anxious about the impact that the measure will have and angry about how the Government have treated people who deserve better.</p>
	<p pid="a.553.3/25">Therefore, today, the Opposition are glad to be giving Government Members an opportunity to make amends and a chance to dissociate themselves with this disreputable raid on the incomes of older people. They have a choice. Do they stand with the millions of people who have worked hard and saved what they can? Or do they stand with the Chancellor and his friend, the Chief Secretary, who see pensioners as a soft touch ripe for a sneaky tax grab? The Opposition know whose side we are on. We are about to find out whose side Government Members are on.</p>

Between now and 11 minutes past 3, the average age at which people are expected to die in this country will increase by 15 minutes. As a consequence, by 2041, the amount we spend on old-age pensions will have increased from about &#163;80 billion now to &#163;250 billion, even with the changes introduced by my right hon.

	<p pid="a.555.2/3">and his colleagues.

	<p pid="a.555.2/4">I can understand why Labour Members have tabled amendments on VAT and other matters&#8212;they can make their political points about the balance in the Budget and the Finance Bill with complete justice&#8212;but I am seriously disappointed that they have tabled amendments on this issue, because it is the most modest start to trying to deal with what is a really big and fundamental problem for us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.556.1/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. When Sir Winston Churchill served in Lloyd George&#8217;s Cabinet and the Liberals introduced the universal pension&#8212;one of that Government&#8217;s great achievements&#8212;a quarter of people never reached pension age. They never got to the point where they could draw down their pension. We are in a completely different place now.</p>
	<p pid="a.556.1/2">I am not proposing to the Committee that we start now to think about the wholesale and widespread pension reform that is required, but surely we should start by trying to change some of the anomalies, and this anomaly is such a glaringly obvious one. At the moment, Members on both sides of the House, including those of us who represent constituencies with many low-earners&#8212;low-earners with families struggling desperately&#8212;are telling our constituents to pay a different rate of tax from pensioners, who, only because of their age, qualify for a different allowance.</p>

Manifestos are, by their nature, broad brush, and this is such a tiny change to the tax system in the grand scheme of what the Treasury has to deal with. It is entirely right that the Government are, bravely, addressing it now. In all honesty, would either party go down to such detail in any future manifesto? It is entirely right that the Government are saying, &#8220;This is an anomaly. It is incorrect and unfair, and what is more, it is one of the many anomalies that are unaffordable in the long term.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.557.0/1">I profoundly respect the hon. Gentleman. He is a torchbearer for a former age in the Labour party, and he should raise that point with his own Front-Bench team. We are clearly not going to agree on it. However, at some point, someone needs to face up to the fact that we will almost double spending on old-age pensions between now and 2040. I shall put that in context: the number of people retiring this year who will be alive in 2041 will be more significant than now. I cannot give the precise figure, but hundreds of thousands of people retiring in the next few years will be alive in 20 or 30 years. We are not only dealing with an intergenerational problem, with a problem between this generation and a generation in two or three generations&#8217; time or with a problem between people in their 20s and those in their 60s or 70s; we are dealing with a problem of those retiring now and to whom we must promise pensions and a decent standard of living in 30 years&#8217; time. The ability to afford that is at the crux of the Government&#8217;s reforms, and this proposal is just the start of it.</p>

As a Government, we are in the position of having to make very difficult decisions. Again, it is a point of great pride to me that we are being brave enough to make those decisions and to spread the load throughout the entire taxpayer base. It is a matter of extraordinary difficulty, but the group that has been hit least so far by the savings, efficiencies and cuts that the Government have had to make has been pensioners, because they have benefited from the triple lock and a whole series of other interventions by the Government, and because they are not recipients of other benefits. As a result, this measure is probably the most modest incursion into pensioner income.</p>

	<p pid="a.559.4/1">I will, but before I do, let me say in response to that intervention that there are many pensioners in my constituency who are on very low incomes. They are suffering considerably at the moment. Most of them do not have incomes anywhere close to the current allowance. What we are trying to do&#8212;in improving their lot through the triple lock guarantee, as well as protecting the pension credit, the winter fuel payments, the cold weather payments and the free TV licences&#8212;is protect the benefits of those who are least able to look after themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.4/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase> is right in another sense. It is not just today&#8217;s vulnerable pensioners whom we must look after and seek to help, but the vulnerable pensioners in 20 and 30 years&#8217; time. If we do not make changes now and try to protect the state&#8217;s income to some degree, we will not be in a position even to afford the benefits and pensions that we promise people now, let alone to anything like that degree in 20 or 30 years&#8217; time, and that will be a problem for both parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.559.5/1">Obviously the proposals that we are talking about today do not apply to the very poorest pensioners or the better-off pensioners. However, let me ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question: what incentive will there be for people to save for their retirement?</p>

	<p pid="a.559.6/1">The hon. Lady is entirely right. One of the terrifying things that comes out of all public opinion surveys is the lack of savings and even the lack of people expecting to save for their old age. I hope that the reforms brought in by the Minister responsible for</p>
	<p pid="a.559.6/2">pensions&#8212;the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>&#8212;for auto-enrolment and encouraging savings will be the beginning of a fully funded pensions system.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.6/3">However, that is for another debate. I am aware of the strictures regarding Committee time and the fact that other Members wish to speak. I would therefore like to make one final comment. Lord Turner&#8217;s 2005 report, which was commissioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.559.6/4">&#8220;unless new government initiatives can make a major difference to behaviour, the present voluntary system of pension savings, combined with the present state system, is unlikely to deliver adequate pension provision.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.559.6/5">Moreover, he went on to say that the only means of achieving that would be through cross-party consensus. If we are to be serious about providing decent pensions, not only to people today, but to people in five, 10 and 15 years&#8217; time&#8212;that includes people retiring this year and next year, who will be in their 80s and 90s when we will really be starting to pick up the bill&#8212;all parties must, between us, come to some sort of consensus about the difficult decisions that need to be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.0/1">In that context, does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we are to encourage confidence among people out there that they can commit to planning and saving for their pensions, no Government should ever engage in an easy drive-by hit on pensioners?</p>

	<p pid="a.560.1/1">The hon. Gentleman would be right, were the changes in the Bill modest to that degree. They represent a freeze for those who are already receiving the allowance, which will be merged into the basic rate allowance which will then move up towards it. In that regard, the taper could not be more gentle.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.1/2">It is entirely right to say that the Government need to sketch out a very long-term plan for pensions, and I know that the Pensions Minister is beginning that process, but it will need the support, input and intellectual vigour of Members such as the hon. Member for Leeds West if it is to be a success in the long term. Otherwise, we and our successors will be unable to pay the bill, and pensioners will be freezing and starving as a result. The bill will be unaffordable and we will be fighting to pay it against a global economy in which we are unable to compete. That is a terrifying prospect, and I hope that we can begin to deal with it now by supporting the Government in what I hope is the first of many of the changes that need to be made in order to protect the living standards, the decency and the dignity of those people who have worked hard all the way through their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.560.4/1">I will try to keep my remarks short. I have listened to today&#8217;s debate with great interest. First and foremost, it is important that we take proper account of the long-term erosion of pensioners&#8217; incomes over</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/2">the past three decades, since the link between earnings and the state pension was broken, and of the more recent pressures in the wake of the financial crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.560.4/3">The changes to age-related allowances that we are discussing will not affect the poorest pensioners or those who are comfortably off. They will, however, affect the 40% of pensioners who have modest incomes. Those people have saved for their retirement, and 4.4 million older people will be worse off as a result of the changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.561.0/1">I agree with everything that the hon. Lady has said so far. Does she agree that a subject that we do not discuss often enough is that of pensioners who rely on their savings? Low interest rates mean that they are currently getting a far lower income from their savings than they had envisaged.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.561.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" speakername="Eilidh Whiteford" colnum="561"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0002.htm#12041924001188">
	<p pid="a.561.1/1">I absolutely agree. In fact, that was one of the points that I wanted to make, because that subject has been eclipsed in the debate about the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.1/2">The Government have made great play of the recent increases to the state pension, and seem to suggest that they will somehow offset the changes to the tax allowances. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase> pointed out, however, we must remember that that is simply an inflationary rise. It will only keep pace with prices; it is not an increase. It is only a small step in the right direction towards restoring pensioners&#8217; incomes to a level that most of us would recognise as providing a decent standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.1/3">I have mentioned in the House before that the way in which pensioners experience inflation can differ markedly from the way in which the general population as a whole experiences it. One of the most obvious and significant examples of that relates to heating and domestic fuel costs. Retired people are more likely to have to heat their homes during the day, while the rest of us enjoy the benefit of our workplace heating systems. Many pensioners also find it harder to keep warm because of their age and the fact that they are not moving about so much. So any inflation in the cost of energy is felt disproportionately by pensioners, and nowhere more so than in those parts of these islands that experience consistently colder weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.1/4">Last year, we saw sharp and dramatic increases in home energy costs, which played a big part in driving inflation up to over 5%. Energy prices have come down since that peak, but I heard on the news this morning that some economic commentators believe that inflation this year is going to be well above the Bank of England forecasts that the Government are using, and that we could experience inflation of over 3% this year as well. The welcome increases in the state pension have only kept it in line with inflation and might not keep it in line with inflation as it is experienced by people of pensionable age. That is why the Government&#8217;s argument that the changes to age-related tax allowances are compensated for by the increases in the state pension is somewhat spurious. In real terms, this tax grab squeezes the incomes of pensioners on modest incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.1/5">It is also all too easy to forget that pensioners have already paid a heavy price for the financial crisis. Those pensioners affected by these new changes to age-related allowances are in many cases the same people who saw</p>
	<p pid="a.561.1/6">the value of their savings and investments plummet in the wake of the financial crisis. Since then, they have had to contend with record low interest rates, coupled with high inflation. As the Treasury Committee reminded us earlier this week, quantitative easing, whatever its intended consequences, has had some very nasty side effects for those reaching retirement age and looking to buy an annuity in the last few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.562.0/1">The hon. Lady, like me, has many pensioners in her constituency who are on modest incomes and thought they could afford to live out their retirement and be able to cope with running a car, higher food prices and all the other added costs of rural living.

	<p pid="a.562.1/1">I agree entirely. It is not only about rural and transport costs, but increases in VAT, cuts in fuel allowances and so forth. All these things have put a real squeeze on people living on fixed incomes, who have little opportunity to find money from any other source. These have not been easy financial times for those on fixed incomes, who have been the forgotten victims of the financial crisis. It is not fair to say that pensioners have got off lightly so far from the public spending squeeze&#8212;quite the reverse. In considering changes to age-related allowances, we need to understand that the granny tax will tighten the screw on people who have already had significantly to tighten their belts in recent times.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.1/2">Those affected by this measure are all living on below-average incomes. Most will have paid tax throughout their working lives, and most thought they were doing the responsible thing by saving for their retirement. Crucially, they do not have the opportunity to find alternative sources of income. They are on fixed incomes and are living off savings.</p>

Frankly, with average earnings above that, I do think that most of those pensioners are living in what most people would consider to be quite modest circumstances, particularly when, as I have already argued, they have to pay much greater heating costs. Their lifestyles are not without particular burdens that they have to bear, and they do not have a chance to improve them.</p>

	<p pid="a.562.7/2">The Government had a chance to regain the confidence of pensioners after a long hiatus and much erosion of the position of pensioners over a number of decades, but I think they have squandered that opportunity. They are sneaking through these proposals in the fine print, claiming that they are for simplification. That undermines whatever confidence pensioners had left in them. On the streets of my constituency, people have been angry to see that what has been given with one hand as a modest increase in the state pension has been taken away from their occupational pension with the other hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.7/3">We are leaving pensioners without any real incentive to save. We are not going to tackle the challenges of our changing demographics with that kind of attitude because people will question whether it is worth their while putting money aside for their retirement.

There is no doubt in my mind that the introduction of that 50p top rate of tax by the last Government&#8212;right in the last throes of the last Government&#8212;was extremely damaging to our country&#8217;s image as a place of business, growth and prosperity.

It is a question of choices, and I feel that the Chancellor has made the right choice. In fact, it is a set of choices: it is not just a choice between one thing and another.

	<p pid="a.564.0/2">It was suggested earlier that 14,000 millionaires would benefit from the tax reduction. I am not sure how Labour Members arrived at that figure, but surely the notion that all our problems could somehow be solved if the rich paid their way is the nub of the issue. Given the relative scarcity of rich people in comparison with the vast majority of the electorate and as a proportion of the United Kingdom&#8217;s population of over 60 million, it is an absolute myth that we could solve all our problems by imposing heavy taxes on bankers and other rich people.</p>

	<p pid="a.564.3/1">I want to make some progress on the main subject of the debate, which is the freezing of tax allowances, but first let me make a couple of other points. Labour Members did not mention that the other thing that the Budget has rightly done is take many people out of tax altogether by increasing tax allowances. I believe that that has benefited up to 24 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.3/2">All this must be seen in the context of deficit reduction. There have been exchanges across the Chamber about parties&#8217; manifestos. I stood on a manifesto that was all about getting some sense back into the public finances and reducing the outrageous deficit that was bequeathed to the current Government. The Chancellor&#8217;s central strategy to deal with that deficit involves 80% of spending cuts and 20% of revenue raising. Given that the Opposition oppose virtually all the spending cuts, would reduce VAT, and are proposing not to freeze older people&#8217;s allowances, we can only conclude that they are not serious about reducing the deficit, and in that regard they are grossly out of step with public opinion.</p>

	<p pid="a.564.5/1">I did not make representations to the Chancellor on a matter as technical as the one that we are discussing. Having dealt with that point, I will now proceed to discuss the freezing of older people&#8217;s allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.5/2">I consider the term &#8220;granny tax&#8221;, coined by the media and exploited by the Labour party, to be very pejorative. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase>, it is also very inaccurate, as 60% of those who will be subject to the freeze are men. Moreover, this is not a new tax, although some sections of the media presented it as such. I do not see how the freezing of an allowance can possibly constitute a new tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.564.5/3">It is unrealistic to suppose that older people should be immune from the need to contribute to reducing the deficit. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> made that point very eloquently. Let me add a statistic of my own: the number of people aged 65 and over is expected to rise by 65% in the next 25 years to 16.4 million. Some of the measures that were introduced so many decades ago to the benefit of older people simply cannot be sustained in the current period of rapid demographic change.</p>

	<p pid="a.565.0/1">I would argue that pensioners are not at all immune to the effects of the Government&#8217;s policies, whether in terms of their cost of living or their access to the NHS, and almost all the pensioners I speak to also argue that. As a result of the allowance freeze, pensioners are paying more because their allowances are not increasing in line with inflation. They are being hit with a tax, therefore, and what really sticks in their craw is that they are being asked to pay this extra money at a time when it appears to them that millionaires are paying less.</p>

	<p pid="a.565.4/1">It cannot be bad that a U-turn should come so quickly. Seriously, however, I wanted to make the point that there are some very poor pensioners in my constituency&#8212;it is more socially mixed than many colleagues might imagine&#8212;and they are suffering greatly. However, the message I get from many of my pensioner constituents is that they worry for their grandchildren. They worry about their opportunities and about the difficulties they will face in getting on the housing ladder and in having the quality of life that their grandparents perhaps took for granted. Many of my pensioner constituents understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s point that the burden of getting the deficit down must be shared across the generations.</p>

	<p pid="a.565.5/1">My hon. Friend has, in part, responded to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase>, and I was going to say that some 5 million older people will not be affected by this measure. We can split hairs on this issue, but I accept that the measure does amount to an additional payment. However, although the allowance freeze does result in an increase in tax payable, it does so only by an average of &#163;84 a year. I accept that that is not nothing, but it is a relatively small sum. The measure is raising so much money for the Exchequer by dint of the fact that so many people are in receipt of state pensions. The pain, as it were, can therefore be shared by many, and the resulting amount per person is very small. I apologise for the fact that I shall not take any more interventions, but so many other Members still want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.5/2">To address the other point made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South, the Government have a good record in protecting people on pensions. We have restored the earnings link. The Labour party had 13 years in which to restore the link, and Barbara Castle called for that every year until her death. We have done it. We have also secured it with the triple lock.</p>
	<p pid="a.565.5/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">The hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase> was ungenerous in arguing that we appeared to be proud of the inflation rate. If she had remained in the Chamber, I would have told her that that inflation has largely been driven by increased oil and commodity prices, which Governments have no control over. It is to the credit of this Government that they were brave enough to say, &#8220;We will increase the state pension by either 2.5%, the rate of inflation or the rate of earnings, whichever is the greater.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.566.1/1">I am sorry, but I will not take any more interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/2">As a result of that Government pledge, there will be no cash losers from this allowance freeze. We have protected universal benefits, with the single exception of not renewing the temporary increase of &#163;100 in the winter fuel payments. We have protected all the other universal benefits, however, as we promised to do. Some 600,000 of the poorest pensioners have received a warm home discount of &#163;120 extra to help with their fuel bills. We have also frozen council tax for two years running. Council tax has been a bone of contention among older people, many of whom have been hit hard by increases in it over the past decade. We have also protected, and increased slightly, the budget for the NHS. As we all know, older people account for more of that expenditure than any other group and they will benefit disproportionately from the NHS budget increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/3">I have already made the point that freezing this allowance will entail a cost of, on average, &#163;84 a year. I accept that that is not a derisory amount for someone living on an income of just over &#163;10,000 a year. However, 5 million pensioners will not be affected by this measure. In fact, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an organisation that Labour Members sometimes cite, has said that the media coverage has lost all perspective on this matter, stating that</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/4">&#8220;you would think it&#8217;s doomsday for older people&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure. I think we&#8217;re losing perspective on phasing out the Age-Related Allowances&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/5">It makes a number of good arguments as to why it takes that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/6">In conclusion, I must say that I have received very few critical letters on this subject from pensioners. The vast majority of older people in my constituency are more concerned with the prospects for their grandchildren; the average age of a new home buyer is now 38. They might not have read &#8220;The Pinch&#8221; by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science, which was published two years ago, but he pointed out, among many other things, that those in the generation born after 1970 are the first not to be able to look forward to a better standard of living than their parents. That point is felt keenly by many older people in my constituency. Although they cannot easily increase their income, they accept that their grandchildren are facing a different</p>
	<p pid="a.566.1/7">future from the one they faced. Unlike the Labour party, they know that the alternative to facing down this deficit, with everyone making a contribution to that strategy, is the further impoverishment of their grandchildren, and that is not a price that they are willing to pay.</p>

	<p pid="a.567.0/1">I am conscious of the time, Mr Bone, so I will keep my speech short. May I start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase> on her excellent introductory speech? What she said clearly reflects the views of Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.0/2">The Chancellor&#8217;s granny tax is certainly the aspect of the Budget that has caused the most anger among my constituents. As we now know, the Chancellor&#8217;s plans, which were buried in the Budget smallprint and described as a &#8220;tax simplification&#8221;, will mean that 4.4 million pensioners who pay income tax will lose an average of &#163;83 per year next April, with people who turn 65 next year set to lose the most, at up to &#163;322. This measure will affect pensioners on modest incomes of between &#163;10,500 and nearly &#163;30,000, with pensioners on incomes above the higher threshold being unaffected by the change. The pensioners in my constituency I have spoken to about the granny tax are really angry about the Chancellor&#8217;s decision to hit them in this way. It seems obvious to them that it cannot be right that while putting up taxes for pensioners, the Government are giving the rich a tax cut. My constituents simply cannot understand why, after they have worked hard all their lives, the Chancellor is now targeting those on low and middle incomes in retirement in order to fund a tax cut for millionaires. As one constituent put it to me recently,</p>
	<p pid="a.567.0/3">&#8220;I sincerely hope you and your colleagues do not support this granny tax and you fight for all our pensioners who worked all our lives to help this country. I am 71 years old and thought I had seen it all, but this is the pits, so do your job and kick this out.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.568.5/1">I supported the Budget a couple of weeks ago and I still do now. It is important to look at it in its entirety, and at how it fits in with other things that are going on. At the moment, an increase in personal allowance is being put in place; it will rise by &#163;1,100 in April 2013, taking it to &#163;9,205 in total. That is the largest real personal tax cut for the median earner in more than a decade, from which 24 million people will</p>
	<p pid="a.568.5/2">benefit. It will give basic rate taxpayers a real cash gain. The Government are taking 2 million low-paid workers out of tax altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.568.5/3">Let me put that increase in local context as the Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth. It lifts an additional 75,000 people in the east of England out of income tax altogether. That will have a dramatic impact on many low earners in my constituency, which is the 54th-most deprived local authority out of 326. The average earnings in Great Yarmouth are &#163;21,900 per annum, compared with the national average of &#163;26,100.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that to benefit from this increase in the tax threshold one first needs to have a job? That is what most of my constituents are asking for&#8212;a job.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which gives me a chance to highlight the good news we had this week regarding the number of people in employment. In Great Yarmouth we saw not only an increase in employment this month, which is very welcome, but an increase in the number of young people in employment. That is a testament to the work the Government are doing, and also, I hope, a sign of the improvements that are coming. It is also a testament to the opportunities put in place through the previous Budget and the work of the Department for Work and Pensions, particularly on work experience and the Work programme, which is also having an impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.1/2">In Great Yarmouth, we also have a particularly high number of part-time and seasonal workers due to the nature of the constituency and its tourism industry. The change in personal allowance is a huge help to that sector of the local work force. It puts extra money into the pockets of hard-working families across my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.2/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is going to talk about the age allowance at any moment. Has he considered its impact on his local economy? That money was not being spent on skiing trips or foreign holidays; it is money that would, in the main, be spent in the local economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.569.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" speakername="Brandon Lewis" colnum="569"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0003.htm#12041925000151">
	<p pid="a.569.3/1">The hon. Lady has just made a very good argument for cutting taxes and increasing the personal allowance, which is exactly what this Government are doing. The reason why I have chosen to talk about particular issues is that I agree with something my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> said a moment ago. Pensioners in my constituency are often concerned about the future for their family&#8212;their children and their grandchildren. The work this Government have done has put in place changes, enterprise zones and opportunities for people to increase jobs, as we have seen this month, so there is a real opportunity for people in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/2">We must also take into account something else. In Great Yarmouth, a prediction listed by our local health teams in the past few years is that our pensioner group will increase by 35% in the next 15 years. That is a huge increase. I fully agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> that we have to ensure that</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/3">this country can provide for people in their pensionable years in future. As we face such an increase in the number of such people, the Government must take the decisions that mean we can provide a good and fair opportunity for the future of all pensioners. That is why I also appreciate the Government&#8217;s work to move towards a fair and straight flat-rate pension for pensioners in future, on which I congratulate them. The work done in the last two Budgets will make that possible. It will mean that our economy can move forward and that we can make fair and proper provision for people in various age groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/4">As the personal allowance for all people, including under-65s who work hard, increases, there will be an impact on pensioners in future. The changes announced in the Budget that simplify the tax system make it clear that there will eventually be a flat, fair and generous rate of allowance for all people. As Opposition Members have admitted, that means that nobody has a cash loss at all. In fact, pensioners under this Government had the biggest increase in their basic state pension ever seen. More than 5 million of the poorest pensioners are unaffected thanks to the triple lock. All pensioners are therefore better off and will receive the biggest ever increase of &#163;5.30 a week. In 2013, they will receive &#163;130 more than they would have received under the previous Government&#8217;s plans. Pensioners will respect this Government for that and appreciate the Government&#8217;s credibility for putting together a solid economic base to allow it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.569.3/5">That is why the measure should be looked at as a whole, particularly for an area such as Great Yarmouth, where we have a high proportion of pensioners. We must make sure that we can provide for them properly and fairly in the future, and also that the economy can create jobs for their families and increase our economic growth. Being in government is about making tough decisions. Those must be the right decisions, and that is what being in government is about. As we heard today from those on the Opposition Front Bench, opposition is often about opportunism, not about making right or proper decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.570.0/1">I shall make a few remarks about an important impact of the changes, which is at risk of going unrecognised. I think of that as the cluster impact of the changes. Our country does not have the same kind of people distributed uniformly across the United Kingdom. People of different ages cluster in different areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/2">I am deeply proud to represent the Wirral, not least because the area has a higher proportion of older people. It is a great strength of our area. They bring a large amount of expertise and stability, and we should not talk about people living longer as though it was a negative thing. I benefited from having grandparents who lived longer than they might have expected, and I cherished each of those relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/3">With that clustering of older people comes a responsibility to pay attention to the issues that affect them. Even if that was not the right thing to do in and of itself, our local economy in Wirral is highly dependent on the income of pensioners. We have many small independent businesses whose relationship with their customers is important. They have regulars of many years&#8217; standing, and many of those people are retired</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/4">and on a fixed income, so even if it was not the case that we should care about the needs of older people, the employment of the rest of us in the Wirral and the vitality of some of the local shops is related to the income of older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/5">Before I deal with the clustering of the local economy and the attention that Ministers must pay to how our economy works in practice, I want to make a few points about longevity and the increase in life expectancy that we are seeing. We must recognise that this is not a uniform phenomenon. Not everybody in our country is living longer in the same way. There is a social justice element. Poverty is still a pretty strong determinant of the length of people&#8217;s life. People such as those in my constituency who have worked in manufacturing might not expect to live as long as those in relatively more affluent parts of the country. My constituency is very mixed, and there are people there who may not be able to expect to live longer as the average increases. That average masks different expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.0/6">When Treasury Ministers make decisions about, for example, age-related allowances, I ask them to find out how those will impact on different parts of the country and different groups of people. The impact will not be uniform. We are not all uniformly living longer in exactly the same way. The NHS is a wonderful thing, but we still have a heck of a long way to go on public health to make sure that poverty does not limit people&#8217;s life expectancy, as it has done in the past and still does.</p>

	<p pid="a.571.0/1">The hon. Lady makes a sensible point. One of the big challenges that faces us in increasing the state pension age and the point at which people retire is trying to understand the different requirements of people who have done heavy manual labour throughout their life or for any part of their life and have had different physical pressures put upon them, and those who have not. But that does not remove the point that most people who are affected by the tax allowance freeze are relatively wealthy pensioners&#8212;most of them. Therefore, although this is not a precise instrument, I am not sure that her point addresses exactly what the Minister seeks to do.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.571.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" speakername="Alison McGovern" colnum="571"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0003.htm#12041925000154">
	<p pid="a.571.1/1">I shall return to my constituents and tell them that a moment of cross-party agreement broke out over the problem that the hon. Gentleman and I agree exists, where we must rightly consider the state pension age, but that that decision will affect certain people in a completely different way from that suggested by any average figure. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to respond to his second point by saying that I will remark later on whom the proposals affect and their relative position.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.1/2">Before making my substantive point about how the economy clusters and how these proposals will affect us, I want to answer the point about inflation made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase>, who has unfortunately just left the Chamber. She sought to make a case against my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase>, saying that the Government were doing pensioners a great service by increasing their pension on inflation, which has come about because of events beyond our shores, and the Government are just trying to respond to the oil price, and so on. I have no doubt that world events have had an impact on inflation</p>
	<p pid="a.571.1/3">in this country. Thankfully, I do not have to work out which events have an impact on inflation and report that to the Chancellor. That is the job of the Governor of the Bank of England. I have read the Governor&#8217;s letters on inflation and he remarks on the impact of the Government&#8217;s VAT rise on inflation. If the hon. Lady were here, I would tell her that it is not entirely true to say that the inflation that we face that has caused the Government to be so proud of their cost of living rise for pensioners is entirely beyond our control. It is in part at least down to the Government&#8217;s action.</p>
	<p pid="a.571.1/4">I want now to think about the cumulative impact of this policy and a couple of others on the part of the world that I represent, but also on similar local economies. Some of the Government&#8217;s decisions have resulted in a kind of conflagration that means that particular localities face a really difficult economic future.</p>

	<p pid="a.572.0/1">The hon. Lady makes much of the fact that age and longevity vary quite a lot throughout the country. She has also made a connection between shorter life span and deprivation. How many of her constituents with a short or shorter than average life span will be affected adversely by the age-related allowance, because it is over &#163;10,000?</p>

	<p pid="a.572.1/1">The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that if you are poor enough to have a short life span, you are not rich enough to be affected by the change, which is an interesting hypothesis. It is a testable proposition, but it seems entirely wide of the mark.</p>

	<p pid="a.572.3/1">I always try to be generous. In fact, I thought that we were agreeing across the House that the argument about increasing life expectancy cannot be made in such a broad-brush way, but perhaps the situation was not as happy as I had thought it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.3/2">I would like Treasury Ministers to stop and think about the cumulative impact of their policies on particular localities. In this place, and in politics generally, we often tend to focus on one particular change or alteration, but people who live in the Wirral and other parts of the country are worried about their economic future and that of their towns and of our country, so the focus on one aspect in isolation can sometimes be unhelpful. If a place has any level of worklessness and its local authority has had its area-based grant removed and is facing severe cuts, there will be a knock-on impact on its ability to provide social care. If a place such as the Wirral had previously seen leadership, investment and resources expended by a regional development agency, it will have lost the body that was driving forward its economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.572.3/3">The Wirral has a high proportion of older people, but some parts of the country, such as parts of London, have high levels of worklessness and a high proportion of younger people who have lost out as a result of the removal of the education maintenance allowance and other changes. That means that particular localities are having money taken out of their economies from different directions as a result of Government policy. We cannot shy away from looking at the impact that that has on the</p>
	<p pid="a.572.3/4">possibility of developing those areas. When any company seeking to invest looks at whether it should put money into the Wirral or any other area, it will first do the postcode analysis of the resources that local people have, so it makes it harder and harder to get investment when the Government, by different means over time, seem to be taking money out of particular localities.</p>

	<p pid="a.573.0/1">The hon. Lady is making a powerful point about the cumulative impact of policies on particular regions of the country. Her constituency is close to mine. Will she concede that in the last year of the previous Government the north-south divide, measured in terms of gross value added per head, reached its maximum level in the past 20 years? That is something we have to fix in this Parliament, not continue.</p>

	<p pid="a.573.1/1">I am so pleased that the hon. Gentleman chose to mention the north-south divide, because it gives me the opportunity to discuss a concept that trips off the tongue so easily but is actually extremely unhelpful in tackling the kind of local economic development that I am asking Treasury Ministers to consider when making decisions. He will know as well as I do that the north-west, which we both represent, although it has significant deprivation, also has some pretty wealthy areas&#8212;the Chancellor himself has the honour of representing one such area. The north-south divide, as a concept, masks a whole lot of other inequalities. Again, I mention the inequalities that exist in London. It cannot be said that there is a simple, straightforward north-south divide in this country affecting every locality in the same way; we should have a much more fine-grained analysis. There are places in the north that are extremely successful and places in the south that really need help.</p>

	<p pid="a.573.4/1">I thank the hon. Lady for giving way again; she is being extraordinarily generous in taking interventions. She is making a characteristically extraordinarily thoughtful speech. It is a matter of great concern that over the past decade and a half, the gap between the least well-off and the richest has grown. There is now more inequality. Will it not help to reduce the inequality between pensioners to increase the basic state pension by the biggest amount ever&#8212;&#163;5.30, which is a big jump&#8212;and to ensure that the richest pensioners do not get such a high benefit, but do not lose out either, by capping the allowance?</p>

	<p pid="a.573.5/1">That was a long intervention. The hon. Gentleman said that inequality grew under the previous Government. I point him to analysis done, if I recall correctly, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies at the time of the 2010 general election, which showed that the incomes of the lowest on the income scale increased significantly under the previous Government. We can</p>
	<p pid="a.573.5/2">have a discussion about how one deals with the inequality that is created when the incomes of people who earn a great deal of money rise, but I fear that it would not be within the scope of this debate. I am sure that we will discuss that on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.573.5/3">I will conclude my remarks by talking about the squeezed middle, because it is people on what one would think of as middle incomes who are affected by age-related allowances. In its frequently asked questions section on this policy, the BBC states that</p>
	<p pid="a.573.5/4">&#8220;it is a &#8216;middle-income&#8217; range of 40% of pensioners who will not get what they might have expected from the tax system.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.575.0/1">The great Bill Shankly once said that he was always surprised that people were surprised at surprises. In one sense it is surprising that Government Members seem to question the BBC and yet cannot intervene to tell me that it is wrong. As the BBC states, those affected will be</p>
	<p pid="a.575.0/2">&#8220;a &#8216;middle-income&#8217; range of&#8230;pensioners who will not get what they might have expected from the tax system.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.575.0/3">That is a very important point. Of course we are all concerned about the impact of the recession on the poorest, but there is another factor to consider. People on middle incomes, who might have had certain expectations about how they could live their life, are now being disappointed and do not know what is coming in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.575.0/4">People feel that one of the big problems with the Budget is that certain matters that were brushed over and not explained fully have subsequently come out as being pretty serious. The insecurity facing people at the moment, especially those in the middle of the income distribution, is really quite serious, not least because it is not very good for people&#8217;s quality of life if they are constantly worrying about what next year might bring financially. How they interact in the economy and their actions as consumers are also deeply affected by that insecurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.575.0/5">One of the biggest challenges for Treasury Ministers to address is how communities such as I have mentioned in the Wirral and other parts of the country, where time after time Government announcements have chipped away at the money in the local economy, can deal with the insecurity facing people. The Budget will have a significant impact on people&#8217;s quality of life.</p>

Does she agree that when we meet older people in our constituencies, it is inspiring to hear how concerned they are about young people&#8217;s future? However, what they see in the Government&#8217;s taking money from 40% of pensioners is not an effort to invest in creating jobs for young people. What really hurts is the fact that that money is being used to give a tax break to millionaires.</p>

	<p pid="a.575.2/1">My hon. Friend is right. Of course, older people are worried about the next generation&#8217;s future, and they do not believe that the Government are making the right move, not least for the reasons that she gave.</p>
	<p pid="a.575.2/2">I hope that Treasury Ministers will reconsider the proposal and their approach to local economic development.

	<p pid="a.575.3/2">First and foremost, the Bill makes it clear that the Government are sticking to the plan to deal with the mess left by Labour and eliminate the structural deficit. That is essential for market confidence in the future of our economy and wealth creation.</p>
	<p pid="a.575.3/3">Secondly, the Bill is clearly on the side of working people and pensioners. It is pro-business and helps people who want to do better for themselves and their families. It cuts tax for 24 million ordinary families across the country, including 2.5 million in the north-west. Thanks to the Budget, most basic rate taxpayers will keep an extra &#163;220 of their salary every year. That represents the largest real personal tax cut for people on average earnings in more than a decade. I appreciate that &#163;220 might not seem like that much to the Labour leader, sat in his multi-million pound home in Primrose Hill, but for people struggling to get by in Cheshire, &#163;220 is a real help. The Bill therefore helps working people.</p>

	<p pid="a.576.5/2">Thanks to measures such as the clamp-down on tax loopholes, the very rich will pay more. There is an ideological divide: the Labour party wants the rich to pay symbolically higher rates of tax; the Budget ensures that the rich actually pay more tax. Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility agree that the 50% rate raises next to nothing. Indeed, having a higher income tax rate than communist China indirectly reduces tax revenues</p>

He raises a good point, but I want to go back to the one made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374" name="Graeme Morrice">the hon. Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase>. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge made the point that the top 1% richest people in the country now contribute 30% of tax to the UK Exchequer. In 1976, when Denis Healey, the famous Labour Chancellor, said he would squeeze the rich until the pips squeak, the top 1% richest people in the country contributed only 11%. So the 1% now contribute significantly more. I would be interested to hear how much more the hon. Gentleman feels they should contribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.2/2">The Bill contains a raft of additional measures, some of which have been mentioned, to promote growth, especially in the north of England. There are far too many to list but I will point out a few that as a northern Member I especially welcome. Enterprise loans to help young people to set up and grow their own businesses are a great idea to foster ambition and creativity among the next generation. I firmly believe that what matters is not where someone comes from or went to school but where they are going, and there is no better way for young people to get on than starting up their own business, working for themselves, employing other people, growing that business and contributing to wealth creation.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.2/3">The introduction of an above-the-line research and development tax credit is a simple but important move. It will help British businesses to stay competitive in the long run and send out the message that we back innovation. I am fortunate to have Daresbury science and innovation campus in my constituency. It is an internationally outstanding campus with more than 100 outstanding start-up businesses. I hope that they will be the Googles, Amazons and Microsofts of the future which are born in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.578.2/4">There are also excellent measures to help make the UK the technology capital of Europe, including a new &#163;100 million fund to support investment in new university research facilities; &#163;60 million of investment in the UK centre for aerodynamics; the allocation of &#163;100 million for ultra-fast broadband in 10 of our biggest cities, including Manchester; &#163;50 million to fund ultra-fast broadband in 10 smaller cities; and the extension of mobile coverage to 60,000 rural homes along 10 key roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.2/1">Thank you, Mr Williams. I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> that, as I alluded earlier, many of these points have been raised by other hon. Members on both sides of the House. I will soon bring my speech to an end. I hope he will forgive me.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.2/2">There is even more support coming business&#8217;s way in my neck of the woods with &#163;4.3 million extra for Cheshire and Warrington local enterprise partnerships. In addition, the Budget confirms a further &#163;130 million for investment in the northern hub rail project, which will work well alongside High Speed 2. Furthermore, the new city deals, which will decentralise power and bring even more investment directly up to Manchester and Liverpool, are excellent news for those great cities and my constituents who commute to them in huge numbers each morning.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.4/1">I have given away several times. I am bringing my speech to a conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.4/2">Finally, I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement that people will now receive a personal tax statement detailing exactly how much tax they have paid and what it has been spent on by the Government. This is a great move for transparency. I know that Labour are nervous about what will happen when people see, in black and white, how much of their taxes go on paying interest on the last Government&#8217;s debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.4/3">This is an excellent Bill. It is a radical and reforming Bill. It comes from a Government firmly on the side of business, working people and pensioners, and it tells the world that Britain is open for business.</p>

	<p pid="a.579.7/1">I think that many Government Members must feel ashamed of this policy, particularly given that it was not in the Conservative party&#8217;s manifesto. Many people who voted for the Conservatives, particularly pensioners, will be disappointed that they have introduced this policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.579.7/2">We have heard numerous comments from Government Members giving the impression that the policy would affect super-rich pensioners, but, in reality, pensioners on modest incomes will be affected. It is pensioners on incomes between &#163;10,500 and &#163;29,400 who will be affected by the change. I do not think that anyone in</p>
	<p pid="a.579.7/3">this House can really believe that these are rich people; rather, we are talking about people on modest or middle incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.580.1/1">That was done as part of a range of measures. We have been talking about a package of measures today, and what we know is that pensioners will be disproportionately affected by the range of measures that this Government are steamrolling through. I will return to that later, but the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point also highlights the fact that the changes proposed at that time treated everybody, of all ages, in the same way. In this debate we are trying to focus on the impact on pensioners of the freeze in what is an age-related benefit. We have heard a number of contributions that have highlighted how pensioners are struggling as a result of many of the Government&#8217;s policies, as well as the economic situation we are in, which the Government are not trying to alleviate.</p>
	<p pid="a.580.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase> put this debate in the bigger picture by highlighting the fact that the &#163;3 billion that the Government will save as a result of the proposed change will be used to help some of the richest people in the country. The big picture is that the richest in this country are getting richer, at a time when the living standards of those on modest or low incomes are going down. We have heard a number of attacks on the last Labour Government in this debate, but the reality is that the figures show that the living standards of those on low, modest or middle incomes went up. There was also an increase in the living standards of the wealthiest in the country, but we are now seeing the living standards of ordinary people&#8212;people on low or modest incomes&#8212;plummeting, while at the same time we see huge and escalating increases in the incomes of rich individuals and many corporations.</p>

	<p pid="a.580.2/1">We hear much from Government Members about the message that this Budget is sending the world&#8212;that Britain is open for business, and so on. What message does my hon. Friend think the Budget is sending to our pensioners up and down the country, and particularly those on incomes that they have worked hard for, by setting money aside and preparing for their pensions?</p>

	<p pid="a.580.3/1">The word &#8220;dignity&#8221; has been used a number of times in this debate. It is an important word, particularly given the proposed change, which has been put forward at short notice. We have had debates about pensioner income over many years in this place. We have heard a number of proposals, from parties in all parts of the House, that would change the financial position of those reaching retirement. However, a common theme has been the importance of giving as much notice as possible of any change, particularly when dealing with people&#8217;s incomes in retirement, so that people can make the changes necessary to cope with the changing world.</p>
	<p pid="a.580.3/2">One of the problems with the proposed change, which will come into effect in 2013-14, is that it represents not a minor or technical change, as many Government Members have said, but quite a substantial drop in income at short notice for people on modest or medium incomes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374" name="Graeme Morrice">the Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase> highlighted the impact on those who turn 65 in 2013-14, who could lose &#163;323 a year, which represents a significant amount, not a technical change. Therefore, to answer my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase>, people in those income brackets will be very disappointed by the change. That is one reason why I have highlighted the fact that the measure was not in the manifesto. If the Government think that it is an important part of their long-term pension reform, it should have been in the manifesto. It should have been consulted on and thought through, and a great deal more notice should have been given to the individuals affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.581.0/1">A key concern of mine is to understand why there should be a higher personal allowance for senior citizens than for hard-pressed families who are struggling to get by. Why does the hon. Lady think that that is justified?</p>

	<p pid="a.581.1/1">I mentioned this in an intervention. At the time of the allowance&#8217;s introduction, a number of reasons were given, one of which was pensioners&#8217; higher heating costs. A full explanation was given during those debates of the higher and additional costs that are associated with retirement. Those higher costs of living have a disproportionate impact on pensioners. In the debates on pensions that we have had over the past few months, a great deal has been said about the higher costs that pensioners face, and about the possibility of having a different form of indexation for pensions, given that pensioners tend to have different living costs from the rest of the population.</p>

	<p pid="a.581.2/1">I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady&#8217;s point about pensioners&#8217; higher living costs, but does she not accept that allowances such as the winter fuel allowance reflect the Government&#8217;s acknowledgement of their different costs? A young mum at home with her baby, who would also need to heat her home, would not get that allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.581.3/1">Many pensioners, and many among the general population, are disappointed that the Government have not lived up to their election promises on that allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.581.3/2">The point that I was making is that pensioners need more time to adjust. I welcome the increase in the personal allowance&#8212;I believe that there should be higher personal allowances for everyone&#8212;but if the Government are going ahead with this particular kind of proposal, they should give people many years&#8217; notice so that they can prepare for the changes. Given the situation that pensions are now in, which I will go into in more detail if I have time, this is the wrong time to be clobbering pensioners in this way.</p>

	<p pid="a.581.4/1">Are we not in this situation partly because of the failure of reform over the past 30 years? Despite the fact that people are living longer and longer, nothing has been</p>

	<p pid="a.582.0/1">The hon. Lady is attempting to rewrite history.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" name="Alison McGovern">the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern)</phrase> highlighted the fact that that increase is far from uniform, owing to health inequalities.

	<p pid="a.582.2/1">Government Members keep trying to return to that point. As I have said, the freeze applied to all allowances, and it is not comparable to what we are debating. This is a specific debate about long-term Government policy towards pensioners and the long-term cumulative effect that this change will have.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/2">As I say, this is the wrong time to come forward with changes of this nature. We heard a well-informed contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> on the situation faced by pensioners who rely on private savings. I suspect that many of us as constituency MPs have had a considerable number of representations from individuals who have planned their pension and retirement savings over many years on the assumption that higher rates of interest would apply, enabling them to live off the savings they had made over a long period. I very much hope that in 2013, when these changes come into force, the economic situation will be different, but I suspect that those pensioners will be in a similar position. That is another powerful reason why now is an incredibly bad time to make changes of this kind. In my view, they should have been introduced with far greater notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.582.2/3">The Government should know that pensioners are being disproportionately affected by the policies they are pursuing. We hear a great deal from Government Members about their ambitious deficit reduction plan&#8212;so far, of course, we have only seen the deficit increase. What we are seeing locally, and I suspect they will be seeing it, too&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Government Members are well aware that they are borrowing more and that the deficit is going up. In their constituencies as well as mine, however, local people will be experiencing the start of draconian cuts in public services, which will have and are already having a disproportionate effect on those in retirement. Even before the current economic difficulties, we were all aware of the struggle councils were having in trying to provide the social services required for our changing demographic and our ageing population.</p>

	<p pid="a.582.3/1">The hon. Lady really must get the point about the deficit right. The deficit has been reduced from more than &#163;150 billion when this Government first came to power to, I think, &#163;132 billion this year. She may be getting confused between deficit and debt,</p>

	<p pid="a.583.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is well aware that borrowing is going up. As I was saying, despite the fact that the Government are failing and have consistently failed to meet their own targets, the reality is that the cuts in public spending they have already made&#8212;and they propose more for the coming years&#8212;are having a disproportionate effect on the pensioner community.</p>

	<p pid="a.583.3/1">The hon. Lady has twice said that pensioners are disproportionately affected by the collection of measures the Government are introducing to reduce the deficit. May I quote what Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said about this particular measure:</p>
	<p pid="a.583.3/2">&#8220;Despite this morning&#8217;s headlines, this looks like a relatively modest tax increase on a group hitherto well sheltered from tax and benefit changes. From this Budget we calculate that pensioners will lose on average one quarter of one per cent of their income in 2014&#8221;?</p>

	<p pid="a.583.4/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituents will be very interested by his complacent approach. I suspect that he is well aware of the impact that the Government&#8217;s cuts are having on his constituents as well as mine, and well aware of the pain that his constituents are suffering. I am sure that he is also aware that pensioners rely disproportionately on social services and the public sector, and that the forthcoming cuts will make life particularly difficult for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.583.4/2">A number of Government Members have tried to set the young against the old by suggesting that young people resent any benefit that pensioners receive. Throughout my life, I have observed exactly the opposite. I believe that young, middle-aged and elderly people think it important for us to value pensioners, to try to give them certainty, and to do what we can to ensure that they enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The Government will make pensioners&#8217; lives more difficult at very short notice if they proceed with this measure, and I hope that they will decide not to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.584.0/1">No, I will happily discuss the granny tax. I feel no shame about my Government&#8217;s policies. Unlike Opposition Members, I am not trying to airbrush out most of the last 12 years of history and pretend that all those disasters never happened. I am happy to address what the Government are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.584.0/2">We need to put the position in context. In the financial year that has just ended we were still spending &#163;126 billion more than the tax revenue that was raised, and we expect to spend more than &#163;90 billion more than tax revenue in the current tax year. That is not a healthy financial situation, and it is not a desirable position. We do not have enough money to go around doing many things that we would like to do, no matter how useful or socially valuable. The global financial situation is very difficult, and we must make difficult decisions. During the election campaign, Government Members told potential constituents &#8220;This will be a difficult Parliament. We will have to make cuts, not because we do not think the things we are cutting are good and not because we would not prefer to leave them as they are, but because we must try to sort out the horrible mess that exists.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.584.2/1">Obviously I did not say that, because I would have been wrong if I had, but I did say that no section of the population would be spared the pain caused by our sorting out the mess that we would have to deal with. I would also have said that I considered the 50p or, more accurately, 52p tax rate an invidious measure which had been devised as a political trap, that it was a terrible tax policy, and that it would probably raise very little money.</p>
	<p pid="a.584.2/2">The two independent studies that support the Budget have shown that the cost of lowering the rate to 45p is about &#163;100 million a year. The saving from the so-called granny tax is approximately 10 times the size of that. If anything in the Budget is being funded by the granny tax, it is the reduction in personal allowances for the low earners in society.</p>

	<p pid="a.586.0/2">Returning to the topic of the granny tax, I do not feel guilt&#8212;that is the wrong word&#8212;but I do strongly believe that we need to simplify our tax system. Setting up the OTS is a great measure that this Government have taken, and it has performed the tasks given to it incredibly well. Those of us who advocate tax simplification have to accept that whenever we try to simplify tax, it is likely that some people will win and others will lose out. At a time of budget constraint, there is no way of softening the blow on those who will be losers, so we are left with a choice between muddling on as we are, with a ridiculously complicated and clunky tax system, or trying to simplify it in the hope that in the long run we will end up with a far better system.</p>

	<p pid="a.586.6/1">Not at the moment. I am sure that all hon. Members have seen pensioners in their surgeries who have suddenly been landed with a huge tax bill that they were not expecting because PAYE had not been deducted from a private pension or because they had different income levels from those they were expecting. All of a sudden these people are facing a bill of a &#163;1,000 or more that they literally cannot afford, and through no fault of their own. So the whole spirit of trying to simplify the tax position for pensioners is exactly the</p>
	<p pid="a.586.6/2">right way forward. This measure is not the end of that; it will be the start of trying to get to a place where everyone can understand what their correct tax position will be and will not have to fill in myriad tax returns. People have to claim this age-related allowance, and that is slightly unusual. Normally, people expect their personal allowance to be an automatic thing, but people have to write to claim this, and that has always struck me as a strange anomaly.</p>
	<p pid="a.586.6/3">The direction we are trying to take is clearly the right one. This measure is not something that any of us would have wanted to do, and I feel sympathy for all those pensioners, including my parents, who will lose money as a result of it. This is one of the many issues about which we do not just get grief from our constituents; we get grief about it from our own families every time we see them. I have to try to explain to my family why they have to put up with this pain. When we have got the personal allowance up to &#163;10,000, the actual value of these increased allowances over that level will have been greatly reduced compared with the &#163;3,000 difference that I believe the figure was at the start of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.586.6/4">I do not think that anyone in this House is saying that as the basic personal allowance is rightly hiked up to &#163;10,000, there is any way we can afford to hike the pension one up by the same amount&#8212;all anyone was ever expecting was for it to go up by some measure of inflation. As that benefit was to be so reduced by the end of this Parliament, we have to wonder whether or not the actual benefit to people would have been worth all the complexity, and all the hassle of maintaining these things and the delivery cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.586.6/5">So I say to the Government that simplifying tax is right. This measure is one of those in the box marked, &#8220;Necessary, but unpleasant and not what we wanted to do&#8221;. We would all much rather find ways of giving our pensioners more income, but I am convinced that this is one of those things that we just have to do to take our tax system in the right direction and try to fix the deficit. However, I encourage the Government to examine all the other things in the Office of Tax Simplification&#8217;s report on tax and pensions and try to introduce some of them too, so that we get a fully developed and balanced reform, rather than just this start.</p>

	<p pid="a.587.2/1">I am now totally baffled, because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> returned to the simplification issue, but what we heard earlier, when he perhaps was not in the Chamber, was an impassioned ex post facto rationalisation for this change given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the hon. Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> and, to a lesser extent, by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the hon.

They sought to assure us that this really was not about simplification, and that it was all part of a master plan to deal with the problems of an ageing population and make the pensions system better for people. So I am now baffled as to which it is. Is it about tax simplification only or is it about a very thoughtful plan, which had not previously been mentioned? This is where I was also puzzled by what the hon.</p>
	<p pid="a.587.2/2">Member for Ipswich said, because nothing of what he said was said by the Chancellor; no obvious rationale on those terms was given by the Chancellor when he introduced this measure in his Budget speech, as he slipped it in as being &#8220;simplification&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.587.2/3">This is not part of dealing with the problem of an ageing population; there are other ways of doing that. If the money raised was to be used to help with pensions, it would be a different matter. If it were to be used to help people in my constituency who are struggling with increased care costs and who are not getting assistance with care because they do not meet the extremely high thresholds that are now being imposed, we would have to listen to the suggestion. However, the provision is about finding some extra money to fund the big tax cut that has been given to people with high incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.588.1/1">I think it is important to see this in the context of the cut in the 50p rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.1/2">I am also concerned about some of the attempts today to counterpose and, as usual, level down. It is fascinating. We heard earlier that if we were going to increase the allowances for young people and working people, it was not fair that older people who were already retired should have a higher threshold. Why do the Government always want to level down? Why do they feel, essentially, that they have to pit one group against another rather than saying that the unfairness lies in the high tax levels for working families? Let us not forget that many of those families have not benefited from the rise in the tax threshold because of the changes to tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.588.1/3">Some of the apparently quite small measures that the Government are introducing are illogical. We keep being told that we want people to save and to benefit from savings and work, but yet again this measure undermines that. We have seen that, too, in the way in which working tax credit has been dealt with. We have heard about people with very low working hours who will lose a lot of working tax credit. Working tax credit was frozen, however, and was not increased in line with inflation when benefits were. That totally contradicts the Government&#8217;s own policies, because if we want to make work pay rather than benefits, why put up benefits in line with inflation but not working tax credit?</p>

	<p pid="a.588.2/1">One key point is missing from this debate, and that is a memory on the part of the Labour party. We have heard a lot of cant from the Opposition and they have shown very little memory of the pensions raid back in 1997, which knocks the issue of age-related</p>
	<p pid="a.588.2/2">allowances into a cocked hat. It should be remembered that there was a &#163;150 billion pension stealth tax at that time. Indeed, Ros Altmann, who was an adviser to Tony Blair, famously said that Labour &#8220;destroyed our pensions system&#8221;. The numbers involved as regards age-related allowances are small compared with that massive and unjustified smash-and-grab raid on our pension system, which destroyed the private savings culture that had been built up over so many years. Then, if we look at age-related allowances alongside the insidious introduction of pensions means-testing, which was a massive attack on personal responsibility, it is extraordinary to hear arguments from the Labour party that the measures on age-related allowances somehow take away that personal responsibility given that it introduced a whole system that systematically wrecked the taking of personal responsibility. I think we need to hear a bit more humility from the Labour party and a bit more of an apology.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.1/1">On the contrary, I am really delighted that we have delivered on the pensions triple lock guarantee. Some hon. Members might recall that back in April 2000&#8212;it was a long time ago so perhaps the hon. Lady has forgotten&#8212;the basic state pension rose by 75p.

	<p pid="a.589.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way because he makes this link between the 75p increase, which did not go down well at the time but was based on inflation, and this increase, which is of course also based on inflation. Pensioners will get no benefit whatever&#8212;no increase in their pension&#8212;from this amount. It simply compensates them for the rate of inflation. In fact, they will lose out because it is based on the consumer prices index, not the retail prices index. For most pensioners, the inflation they feel is much closer to RPI; indeed it is above that because of the way their expenditure has to be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.3/1">The hon. Lady forgets that the way the triple lock works involves not just inflation but earnings. At the moment, earnings are not rising at a great rate of knots because of the massive economic mismanagement of the Labour party that this Government are trying to put right, and that is not being assisted by the chaos in the eurozone. Over time, however, earnings will outstrip inflation and I suspect that will happen in the latter part of this year, so that has a bearing on age-related allowances.</p>

	<p pid="a.589.4/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is some hollowness to the Labour party&#8217;s argument regarding the state benefit? After all, Labour prevaricated for many years from the early 1980s in relation to the link to earnings that was taken</p>

It is true that we took away the whole issue of the earnings link but we restored it whereas the Labour party sat by as a spectator, including in its time in government.

	<p pid="a.590.5/1">I will deal with that in my remarks on child benefit, which we will debate shortly. The idea of people having the same personal allowance whether they are 64, 65 or 75 seems to me perfectly sensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/2">The changes made by the clause will help ensure that people get the allowances to which they are entitled, pay the right amount of tax and make it more straightforward for Government to administer, thereby minimising costs to the taxpayer. A 2009 report from the Public Accounts Committee commented that the age-related allowances were</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/3">&#8220;complex and hard for older people to understand and place too much emphasis on older people having to prove their eligibility, resulting in errors in claims and potential overpayments of tax&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/4">In March this year, the Office of Tax Simplification published its interim report, &#8220;Review of Pensioner Taxation&#8221;, which highlighted no less than nine complexities in relation to the age-related personal allowance. One of</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/5">the main sources of complication is the taper, which we have heard about in the debate this afternoon. The taper removes an individual&#8217;s personal allowance where their income exceeds &#163;24,000 at a rate of &#163;1 for every &#163;2 over this limit, up to the point at which their personal allowance is the same as that for an individual born after <phrase class="date" code="1948-04-06">6 April 1948</phrase>. This creates a 30% effective marginal rate of tax for individuals on relatively modest incomes and brings people into the self-assessment system when, in most cases, they would otherwise have no need to complete a tax return.</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/6">For some, in particular people whose tax affairs have previously been entirely dealt with under the PAYE system through their working lives, and who have therefore had nothing to do with HMRC, this can be a challenge. They now find themselves having to complete forms and tax returns for HMRC because they may be affected by the taper when they reach the age of 65. The changes made by the clause, alongside the increases that we have made to the personal allowance, mean that we can now simplify the system of personal allowances. This will remove complexity and confusion for some taxpayers. But nobody will lose out in cash terms as a result of these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.590.5/7">Let me emphasise that point. As a result of these changes, nobody will lose out in cash terms. In fact, half the people over 65 in 2013-14 will pay no income tax at all and are unaffected by these changes. Those who are affected by the withdrawal of age- related allowances will benefit from a &#163;1,100 increase in the personal allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.591.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. What we are seeing, and what we have seen over the past few years while this Government have been in office, are rapid increases in the personal allowance. The main personal allowance is rapidly catching up with the age-related allowance, which gives us this opportunity to make the simplification, as we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.591.3/2">Those who are affected by the withdrawal of age-related allowances will still see the total amount of deductions that they pay reduce significantly compared to those under the age of 65, because we are retaining the exemption from national insurance contributions for those of state pension age. So, for example, even under the freeze, a 69-year-old with an income of &#163;18,000 in</p>
	<p pid="a.591.3/3">2013-14 will pay less than half as much in tax and national insurance contributions as someone aged 30 earning the same amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.591.3/4">Let us take another example. An individual earning &#163;14,000 a year and born on or after <phrase class="date" code="1948-04-06">6 April 1948</phrase> and therefore not eligible for an age-related allowance will still pay less than half as much tax and national insurance in 2013-14 on employment income as the previous year when they turned 65 if male and 62 if female. This is the result of the increase in the personal allowance and because people of state pension age do not pay national insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.591.3/5">It is important to consider these changes to the age-related allowances in the context of the wider support that the Government offer to pensioners. It has been said today that pensioners have been disproportionately hit, but that is simply not true. The UK has 11 million pensioners right across the income distribution who receive the basic state pension. They benefit significantly from the Government&#8217;s decision to introduce the triple lock for the basic state pension and will continue to benefit year after year. The triple lock was one of the earliest actions of this Government. It ensures that each year the basic state pension will be uprated by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. That meant that from this April the basic state pension increased by the CPI inflation rate of 5.2%, an increase of &#163;5.30 a week in a full basic state pension, the largest ever cash increase in the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.591.3/6">Under the previous Government&#8217;s plans, which we inherited, the basic state pension would have increased not by inflation but by earnings, which this year was only 2.8%. That would have been an increase of only &#163;2.85 a week. This means that the basic state pension is &#163;170 a year higher in 2012 than it would have been under the plans of the previous Government. It is all very well saying that it is inflation; that was not how the previous Government were going to calculate it. It would have been by earnings, and on this occasion that would have been lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.592.0/1">The Minister may be too young to remember, but the Conservative Government under Mrs Thatcher abolished the Rooker-Wise amendment.

	<p pid="a.592.1/1">The Rooker-Wise amendment related to tax thresholds. As for indexation, we are using the higher of earnings or inflation or 2.5%. The plans we inherited were just earnings. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.1/2">Despite difficult economic conditions, the Government continue to protect benefits for pensioners, including winter fuel payments, free bus passes and free prescriptions, to name but a few. Many pensioners are also benefiting from the Government&#8217;s decision to make funding available to local authorities to freeze council tax, and we also have the Warm Homes discount. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has submitted evidence to the Treasury Committee showing that pensioners are the group least affected by the tax and benefit changes implemented by the</p>

	<p pid="a.593.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to remind the House of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.593.1/2">We must ask ourselves whether pensioners are disproportionately affected by Government policies. The answer is clearly no. The evidence is very clear on that. After the reforms, does the tax system treat pensioners unfairly? No. By definition, having one personal allowance across the board, regardless of age, is not unfair on pensioners. Is there a strong, principled case for different personal allowances based on age? We have not heard that case made today, other than the fact that Winston Churchill thought it was a good idea in 1925. The official Opposition&#8217;s policy is to tell everyone under 65 that they should have a lower personal allowance than those over 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.593.1/3">Clause 4 supports the Government&#8217;s long-term aim of simplifying the tax system by creating a single personal allowance. It removes the complicated tapering system, making personal allowances easier to understand.

	<p pid="a.593.2/1">If you believe what the Exchequer Secretary said, Mr Williams, you would think that pensioners would have come to Parliament today to thank the Government for everything they have done for them. The reality is that pensioners up and down the country feel seriously let down by the Government. In contrast to the out-of-touch speech we heard from the Exchequer Secretary, we have heard concerns from Opposition Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Wirral South (Alison McGovern), for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark), for Livingston (Graeme Morrice) and for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore), and we heard a contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase>. They stick up for their constituents, listen to them and understand their concerns that pensioners will lose &#163;83 this year and those who will retire next year will lose &#163;322, with very little notice, and that is after many other hits, including the increase in VAT, and despite the fact that pensioners face additional costs, such as heating, compared with other people, and that the Government have done so little to consult on these changes before they are introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.593.2/2">The fact is that this tax raid on pensioners is being used to fund a tax cut for millionaires&#8212;a tax cut worth &#163;40,000 for 14,000 millionaires. That shows where the priorities lie for Government Members. The priorities for Opposition Members lie with ordinary families, young people and pensioners, who are feeling the full impact of the Government&#8217;s policies. All Members now have a chance to show where their priorities lie; are they with millionaires or with pensioners? Will Government Members listen to the leadership of their former leader, Winston Churchill, who introduced the age-related allowance in 1925, or to their current leadership, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, who are making a tax grab on pensioners? It is up to Government Members to decide how they will vote, but pensioners up and down the country will be watching this afternoon to see where their priorities lie, because the reality is that the Government are introducing these reforms because they want to help millionaires and hurt pensioners.

	<p pid="a.604.0/1">I see the hon. Lady on the Opposition Front Bench agrees with me about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/2">Perhaps it is appropriate to start by reminding the House of what our right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-26">26 May 2009</phrase>. He said that he had accepted, as Conservative party policy, that</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/3">&#8220;The House of Commons should have more control over its own timetable, so there&#8217;s time for proper scrutiny and debate.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.604.0/6">because</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/7">&#8220;that&#8217;s when you really need proper, impartial, effective scrutiny&#8212;not partisan point-scoring and posturing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/8">It is against that background that I enter into this debate with confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/9">The Government&#8217;s proposals will, by their own admission, result in more complexity and less simplicity, which is completely at odds with their avowed intent on tax policy. The administrative costs alone will exceed &#163;100 million, and 650 extra staff will have to be taken on to administer what is effectively the removal of child benefit from 1.2 million families.</p>

	<p pid="a.604.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman entirely. I recall when child benefit was first introduced in the 1970s, and I have to point out to those on the Government Front Bench that, throughout the Thatcher and Major Governments, no attempt was made to get rid of that universal benefit. We should stick with universality in this case.</p>

	<p pid="a.604.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Even during the International Monetary Fund crisis in the mid-1970s, things never got so tough that the Government of the day felt the need to interfere with child benefit. It was a reflection of the fact that families with children had higher costs than those without.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.2/2">The proposals will create all sorts of perverse incentives, and the people who want to try to avoid the measures will have a field day. This has been well covered by the Treasury Select Committee&#8217;s recent report, as well as by the Chartered Institute of Taxation and other expert bodies. The fundamental issue is the proposals&#8217; lack of fairness, as between one family and another.</p>

	<p pid="a.604.3/1">The Centre for Social Justice says that the Government&#8217;s policy</p>

	<p pid="a.604.3/3">and that it</p>

	<p pid="a.604.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a really good point, which was also covered in the recent Adjournment debate on this subject, which received what I can describe only as a rather woolly response from the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" name="David Gauke">the Member for South West Hertfordshire (Mr Gauke)</phrase>. He said that, basically, something was going to happen in this Parliament but the Government were not quite sure what or when. That was not good enough. We need an opportunity to</p>
	<p pid="a.604.4/2">look at the whole issue of transferrable tax allowances, and allowances in the tax and benefit system that recognise the family and marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.4/3">Returning to the issue of fairness, two people on &#163;50,000 a year with children will not have to pay the high income child benefit charge, whereas a family with children with one person earning over &#163;60,000 will have to pay it.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.0/1">On the issue of fairness, would my hon. Friend have any truck with the idea of limiting child benefit to, say, the first two or three children, regardless of the parents&#8217; income, which would retain the universal element?</p>

	<p pid="a.605.1/1">There is a whole host of ideas going round. There was a time when no child benefit or allowance was payable for the first child, on the basis that parents should take responsibility for that child and bear the costs themselves, but, if they had any more, they could expect the state to help them. My hon. Friend&#8217;s point illustrates further the fact that this measure should have been the subject of proper consultation and draft clauses, so that we could have had a debate on it in the wider context of universal benefits. Instead, it was announced at the party conference and implemented in this way.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.2/1">Is not one of the benefits of a universal system of child benefit the fact that everyone in society who has children feels part of that society and that welfare state? The proposal will breed resentment not only between the haves and the have-nots but between the haves and those whose family situation fits the new system.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point against these provisions. On the issue he raises, it would be worth reminding ourselves that the Christian organisation CARE has produced a useful document, &#8220;The Taxation of Families 2010/11&#8221;, which considers whether current tax burdens are fair. It looks at the relative position of households up and down the income distribution scale in the United Kingdom. For a family on &#163;51,543 a year, who represent 150% of the reference wage, a single person with no children is better off than 94% of the population, a one-earner couple with no children are better off than 81% and a lone parent with two children are better off than 80%. Yet a one-earner couple with two children are better off than only 63% of the population and a two-earner couple with two children are better off only than 69%. That shows that targeting families with children for this tax exacerbates the unfairness rather than ameliorating it&#8212;running directly against the principles of fairness, equity and justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.605.4/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his amendment and on his arguments in support of it. Does he agree that because of the failure to consult, we do not know the answer to the question of how this policy will play out between women and men? Currently, child benefit is paid to the mother as the maintainer of children, but she may now come under pressure from</p>
	<p pid="a.605.4/2">her partner to forgo that child benefit so that his tax bill is not affected. That means an injustice between women and men; and, more importantly, it affects the amount of money spent on children.</p>

	<p pid="a.606.0/1">The hon. Lady is absolutely right: that is another of the behavioural consequences, the full implications of which are not yet apparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/2">One has to ask why we are going down this road. The justification for it&#8212;the avowed policy objective&#8212;is this:</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/3">&#8220;In order to address the fiscal deficit, the Government believes that it is right to ask those on higher incomes to contribute more.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/4">The Government&#8217;s proposal, however, asks those on higher incomes with families and children to contribute more, while those on higher incomes without children are not asked to contribute more. I do not see how that can be fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/5">In case anyone thinks this is an issue discussed only among academics, let me say that it certainly goes very close to the heart of many of my constituents. I shall quote briefly from a letter that I received since the Budget from a constituent living in Christchurch. He starts off:</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/6">&#8220;I am writing to express my utter disgust and outrage at your party&#8217;s stance on child allowance announced in the budget last week.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/7">He explains that he and his wife choose to work hard, believing that they have a responsibility</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/8">&#8220;to look after ourselves and to help to generate wealth for the wider community&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/9">by contributing their utmost to industry. He says that he has an income of &#163;60,000 and that his wife earns &#163;12,000, providing a combined income of &#163;72,000. As he puts it:</p>
	<p pid="a.606.0/10">&#8220;under your disgusting new Tax rules we will lose the child benefit for our two children. However, in a household with two working parents earning &#163;40,000 each, combined income of significantly more&#8230;that family gets to keep their benefit.&#8221;</p>

There are approximately another 1.1 million people with taxable incomes of over &#163;60,000 who do not have children. If everyone earning over &#163;60,000 paid an extra &#163;1,000, we would not have to bother with this very partial project of penalising families with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/3">I am not suggesting that as a definite solution. I should much prefer, for example, to reduce our contribution to the European Union. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] However, it would at least be fairer and more consistent with the Government&#8217;s avowed intent that those on higher incomes should contribute more to deficit reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/4">Amendment 9 proposes that the</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/5">&#8220;High-income child benefit charge&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/6">in clause 8 should be described as a higher-income charge. I do not think it accurate to describe someone earning over &#163;50,000 a year as having a high income&#8212;although such people may have a higher relative income, as is apparent from the CARE figures that I gave earlier. Funnily enough, HMRC&#8217;s own Budget document refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/7">&#8220;Child Benefit: Income Tax Charge for Those on Higher Incomes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/8">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept that the charge in clause 8 should also be described as a &#8220;higher&#8221; rather than a &#8220;high&#8221; income charge. Under the heading &#8220;Policy objective&#8221;, the document states:</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/9">&#8220;In order to address the fiscal deficit the Government believes that it is right to ask those on higher incomes to contribute more.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/10">Obviously mine is a small amendment in comparison with the more substantial ones. If the Government are unwilling even to concede that point, it shows that the degree of stubbornness in the Treasury is even greater than many of us thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/11">Is the high-income child benefit charge classified as a tax? I tabled a question to that effect that was due to be answered on Monday, and have just received a written answer from my hon. Friend the Minister&#8212;it should have been given then, but I understand the reason for the delay&#8212;which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/12">&#8220;Classification is a matter for the independent Office for National Statistics.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/13">Effectively, we are talking about a new tax on people with particular incomes, rather than about removing child benefit from them. I have every belief that, in due course, the Office for National Statistics will classify this as a tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/14">The Government have been keen to emphasise the need to cut expenditure, and not so keen to introduce tax increases. That may be why they have been rather coy about admitting that this will probably be a tax</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/15">increase for definition purposes rather than a cut in benefit. My amendment 28, on which I hope we shall have an opportunity to vote, would ensure that there was no unfairness in the treatment of families with identical incomes. The single-parent trap and the couple penalty would be avoided, and the objective that taxes must be fair and simple would be met. This tax is neither fair nor simple.</p>
	<p pid="a.607.0/16">We were discussing the granny tax earlier, and I would describe the measure now under discussion as a tax targeted at mummies and daddies in the squeezed, hard-working middle. People on equivalent incomes without parental responsibilities have nothing extra to pay and some households on joint incomes with children will also pay nothing, whereas single parents earning over &#163;60,000 will pay a minimum of &#163;1,300 a year more than before, and some of them will pay a lot more than that. This cannot be right. I hope the Minister will say the Government have had second thoughts and are minded to withdraw their proposal.</p>

I want to emphasise the word &#8220;child&#8221; because we have lost sight of the fact that we are talking about children. The Child Benefit Bill introduced in May 1975 by the then Labour Government, with all-party support, was intended to offer a universal, non-means-tested, cash-free tax benefit for the good of all children. At its simplest, it was designed to ensure that mothers had money paid regularly into their purses, giving them at least some form of stable income, and that the money would be used for their families.</p>

	<p pid="a.609.1/1">I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman was going to respond to my point about children, but that is obviously not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/2">It is expected that the revised proposal will affect about 1.2 million families. Some 790,000 couples and 30,000 lone parents will lose the full amount of their child benefit. A further 330,000 couples and 20,000 lone parents will lose a proportion of their child benefit. The average loss will be about &#163;1,300.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/3">When these proposals were first announced, I tabled a parliamentary question asking for an estimate&#8212;not an exact figure&#8212;of the number of people earning between &#163;50,000 and &#163;60,000 who are in receipt of child benefit in each parliamentary constituency. I received the answer two days ago.

	<p pid="a.609.3/1">Again, my hon. Friend makes an extremely important point, which I hope to discuss in relation to how the clawback will operate. Will the Minister commit to provide that breakdown by parliamentary constituency and make it available, as a matter of urgency, in the House of Commons Library?</p>
	<p pid="a.609.3/2">It has appeared at various times during the debate that the announcement of the changes was designed more to appeal to the Tory party conference than as a plan to be actually implemented. Suggestions have been made that the Chancellor perhaps did not even believe that he would have to implement it. I do not know whether that is true, but this appears to be yet another part of what the Leader of the Opposition described as an &#8220;omnishambles&#8221;. In Scotland, we would say that the Government&#8217;s plan is a bit of a boorach, which translates as a mess or a muddle.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.3/3">This boorach is, once again, entirely of the Government&#8217;s own making. On the clawback, those with incomes above &#163;50,000 will have their child benefit withdrawn at 1% for each &#163;100 of income from January 2013. There is to be no child benefit entitlement for families where any earner has an income of more than &#163;60,000. Some of the changes being proposed might be small steps forward, but they do not change the fundamental unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.3/4">To return to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40087" name="Stephen McCabe">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe)</phrase> about his constituent Mrs Morris, a couple with children where one earner is on &#163;60,000 and another is on &#163;10,000 will lose all their benefit, whereas a dual-earner couple on &#163;50,000 each will potentially keep it all.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.3/5">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> said, the implementation of this approach will be complex. New computer systems and new staffing will be required. The Government have estimated costs of between &#163;8 million and &#163;13 million for the computer systems&#8217; development and running costs alone, plus &#163;100 million for staff resources. Interestingly, they have estimated that &#163;5 million will be spent on customer information. I do not know exactly what customer information they intend to provide, but I hope that it will be explained in plain English. Over the years I have grown to mistrust Bills that have one-line clauses and multi-page schedules.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.3/6">Schedule 1 is certainly not set out in customer-friendly wording. An MP sitting in an advice surgery trying to look through it to check out whether or not their constituents have an entitlement would have to go through seven pages. After several lines defining person &#8220;P&#8221;, person &#8220;Q&#8221; and whether or not &#8220;Q&#8221; is the partner of &#8220;P&#8221; throughout the week, they would find new section 681C, which provides an equation to work out whether someone would be entitled or not. That is not very customer friendly. There is a serious point as to whether the clawback mechanism is fair and workable.</p>

	<p pid="a.610.0/1">Will the hon. Lady explain to the taxpayers of Sherwood in Nottinghamshire who are working more than 50 hours a week and probably earning only &#163;20,000 as a family, why they should pay tax to support someone earning in excess of &#163;60,000?</p>

	<p pid="a.610.1/1">That is an important point and I will address it straight away. We have to decide whether or not we believe that child benefit is a benefit that should be paid for the good of children. What we are seeing in this measure is an unfair system, which is not providing for children; it is introducing a new form of taxation, as has rightly been pointed out, and people will be facing huge problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.610.1/2">I was going to deal with my next point later, but I shall say now that individuals with an income in excess of &#163;50,000 are going to be required to inform Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs as to whether they or their partner are in receipt of child benefit. It is not clear what would happen where someone either does not know or claims not to know whether their partner is receiving child benefit. In the absence of a legal obligation on partners to share information on benefit receipt, it is unclear what the tax authorities are going to do. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us.</p>

	<p pid="a.610.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. As I have outlined, the problems could be similar if both partners had an income in excess of &#163;50,000. The charge would then apply to the partner with the</p>
	<p pid="a.610.3/2">higher income, and to avoid it being applied twice the partners would presumably have to share information with each other on their incomes and co-ordinate responses in their respective self-assessment forms or HMRC would have to implement some mechanism to link together individuals&#8217; tax records to decide which partner was liable for the charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.610.3/3">As was mentioned earlier, there would potentially be further difficulties if somebody who did not expect to come within the income bracket for the child benefit charge discovered at the end of the tax year that their income exceeded the limit. It can be quite common for self-employed people to find on preparing their accounts that their income was greater than expected. HMRC would then apply the charge retrospectively, but in order to do so it would need full details of the person&#8217;s cohabitation history for the year end. I gently tell the Minister that the potential for disputes is fairly obvious. The living together as husband and wife test is an established feature of the social security system, but we all know from the people who come to our constituency surgeries the problems that emerge. Its extension to the tax system raises a huge range of other issues. Whether a partnership exists will have to be determined on an ongoing basis throughout the year, rather than just at a single point of time, and individuals might not be aware of the need to report changes in their personal circumstances to the tax authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.610.3/4">We have already heard that there is a danger that the plan will encourage people to deny the status of their relationship to avoid the child benefit change, which will effectively introduce a couple penalty. That could be a disincentive for a lone parent considering moving in with a higher income person and could create an incentive for couples to split up when one partner has a high income. For people with several children, partnering decisions could have significant financial implications.</p>

Gentleman&#8212;he said he had some sympathy with my points, so I do not want to be entirely negative in response&#8212;we will not solve the complexities of the taxation system by adding even more complexities that are unfair to families and will affect children negatively.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.3/2">Let me put one final issue on the record. People who are not in work and who receive child benefit for a child under 12 receive national insurance credits to enable them to build up entitlement to state pensions. The</p>
	<p pid="a.611.3/3">Government&#8217;s original announcement led to concerns about the impact on future pension entitlements of women, in particular, if families stopped claiming child benefit. The Government said from the outset that no one would miss out on national insurance credits as a result of the child benefit changes, but it is unclear how they proposed to ensure that. Under the latest proposals, people who are entitled to child benefit and families affected by this charge may elect not to receive it, but a claim for child benefit will still need to be made in order to receive national insurance credits. Information published by HMRC confirms that.</p>
	<p pid="a.611.3/4">I am extremely conscious of the time so I will not say anything more, other than that I think that everybody should listen carefully to the debate and to the points that have been made. When Members consider how to vote, they should consider both the principles involved of support for families with children as well as the layers of complexity and confusion there will be if the proposal goes through.</p>

	<p pid="a.612.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> made a very important point about crossing the Rubicon of undermining the universality of child benefit. The same point was made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch. Some time ago, the Child Poverty Action Group said this about child benefit:</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/3">&#8220;A benefit which goes to virtually all children is of course expensive. But it can also be argued that it is more likely that such a benefit will have &#8216;substantial and wide-ranging support&#8217;, and may be difficult to abolish; provision for the poorest children only, whilst cheaper, is often more precarious.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.612.2/4">Specifically, intergenerational redistribution and the value placed on children are universal values that we are seeking to undermine.</p>

	<p pid="a.612.3/1">What would my hon. Friend say, though, about the example of two wealthy Americans who have four children born in this country who receive child benefit tax-free from the UK Treasury, but have to pay tax on it to the internal revenue service?</p>

	<p pid="a.612.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point and I accept her argument, but we need to look at this proposal within the context of the wider proposals in the Budget. We are rightly reducing the top rate of tax</p>
	<p pid="a.612.4/2">and corporation tax, so for those in the upper 20% income range we have introduced fiscal policies through which we seek to support entrepreneurship and business, supporting those higher-rate earners. We are also proud to be taking a substantial number of poorly paid working people out of tax. My concern is that we are not extending those same tax breaks to the squeezed middle and it is a very important message that we are sending. I accept that the Chancellor has tackled the specific issue of the cliff-edge effect, but he has not done enough to secure my vote in terms of the discrepancy regarding the one taxpayer in a two-person household.</p>

	<p pid="a.613.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely apposite point. If we really are all in this together, it beggars belief for my constituents and his that we are talking about looking after the interests of people on low or median incomes but are remitting abroad, within the European Union, anything between &#163;40 million and &#163;75 million in various benefits for people and families who do not even live in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.1/2">It would not be fair not to mention that the Chancellor has sought to ameliorate the concerns that various Members across the House have expressed about this policy and I give him due credit for that. Unfortunately, however, I think this policy will go badly wrong and will have a specific impact on aspirational, ambitious families and will breach the basic tenet of universality in child benefit. For that reason, I cannot and will not vote for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.613.3/1">There are four problems with the proposal that the Government are putting to the House this evening. First, it is unfair. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> made it clear that it is unfair as between family patterns of income, unfair as between men and women, and unfair as between those who have children and those who do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.3/2">Secondly, the proposal is illogical. Because it is unfair as between those who have children and those who do not, it would be more sensible, in order to have a fairer approach, to address the fact that personal allowances are paid to people on very high incomes. If the Minister is concerned about people on very high incomes, he would do better to shave the personal allowances of people on such incomes, but far from doing that, what he did was cut income tax for those people. That is illogical.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.3/3">Thirdly, the proposal adds to complexity. I hope the Minister can explain to the House how he will maintain the independence of women&#8217;s taxation, given the information sharing requirements of the new system.</p>

	<p pid="a.614.0/1">The point about women&#8217;s tax and independence is extremely important. Does my hon. Friend agree, following also the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase>, that the likely behavioural impact of the changes, which could include women being encouraged or coming under pressure not to work, is that they would contribute to higher female unemployment, which we know is at its highest since 1987?</p>

	<p pid="a.614.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was coming to that point. I want the Minister to address specifically the point about independent taxation of women. He was shaking his head earlier. I hope he will explain from the Dispatch Box in two minutes&#8217; time how he can maintain it. My hon. Friend is right. As I said, there is an issue, thirdly, of complexity being added to the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.1/2">Finally, the proposal is completely uneconomic. It will be bad for work incentives. People will think, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not going to do extra hours.&#8221; There will be arguments in families about who does what. It will also mean that some people will refuse promotions. This is no way to make the British economy more efficient.</p>

	<p pid="a.614.2/1">We are somewhat short of time. There are two reasons why we may not be able to do the measure justice. First, the Opposition tabled an urgent question, which took an hour out of our debate&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> They may groan, but they did. We had agreed that there would be no statements today to allow us to have a proper amount of time. Secondly, the Opposition included in the debate both the clause and the schedule. They need only have put the clause in for us to have the debate. As a consequence, the schedule will not be scrutinised in the Public Bill Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.2/2">Clause 8 introduces a tax charge on a child benefit recipient or their partner if their income is above &#163;50,000. The changes that we are introducing in the Bill ensure a balance between reducing the cost to the Exchequer of child benefit and ensuring that those on low incomes are not affected. Opposition Members like to forget that the reason why we are making very difficult decisions is the state of the public finances that we inherited. We must ensure that the measures that we take are both fair and reasonable. It is only right and proper that we ask those with the broadest shoulders to bear the greatest burden. That is why the measure and others announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor at the Budget&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.614.3/1">The Minister said that the charge would apply if &#8220;their&#8221; income was above &#163;50,000. That would be correct if he accepted the amendment of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase>. But actually it applies if his or her income is above &#163;50,000. But on &#8220;their&#8221; income, they can carry on up to &#163;100,000 as long as the amount is split equally between them.</p>

	<p pid="a.614.4/1">The focus on doing this through the tax system and on having one taxpayer above a certain threshold enables us to avoid the position whereby we would have to put every child benefit claimant through the tax credit system and apply a means-tested system to 8 million different cases, creating a substantially</p>

	<p pid="a.615.2/1">Unfortunately, we are introducing more and more complexity. For example, the new charge must be paid by the higher earner, who might not be claiming child benefit when the lower earner is, even though the lower earner is not legally obliged to inform the higher earner whether he or she is claiming child benefit. This is an absurdity, making our tax system even more complex.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.3/1">I recognise that not everyone wants to address the matter and that there are those who do not want to change the position whereby people earning &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 a year are paying taxes to fund child benefit for substantially wealthier families, and I realise that arguments are made to defend that. But if we are to do something about it, we have a choice. Do we do this through a tax credit system, which means putting everybody through that system, and doing it on a household basis, or do we try to find an alternative way of doing it that reduces the administrative demands? I do not deny that there is complexity in this method, but relatively, we believe that this is the simpler way of doing it.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.4/1">It is misleading to insinuate that poorer families are subsidising better-off families. If there is a need to address income inequalities, why should people who have children pay the price of that rather than people who do and do not have children according to their means?</p>

	<p pid="a.615.5/1">The only benefit received by those in the top 10% of earners, which includes all of us, is child benefit, if they have children. That is the only benefit that we receive, so it is the only one that can be reduced or withdrawn. That is why we have this approach. It is perfectly fair that steps are taken to remove child benefit from those households that contain people in the top 10%.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.6/1">Has the Minister heard of progressive taxation? That would be a concrete way of clawing back money from those who can afford it.

As soon as one starts to chip away at it, it is undermined, and the poorest lose out most.</p>

	<p pid="a.615.7/1">We do have progressive taxation, and under this Government the top 1% of earners pay 27.7% of all income tax at a higher rate than at any point in our history. While considering the universality of child benefit, what is being done was not our first choice, but given the position that we were left in it was necessary. When a Government need to raise revenue it makes sense to turn to a measure with a broad base where a significant number of recipients are not reliant on the additional payments they receive, and child</p>
	<p pid="a.615.7/2">benefit is just that sort of payment. That is why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said that we would seek to withdraw child benefit from higher rate taxpayers. We always said that we would consider how to implement the measure, and we have been clear that a complicated new means test is not a sensible way forward. Instead, we should look to the existing systems and processes to ensure that we can achieve this goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.616.1/1">For those who are in the tax credit system, we currently make an assessment of household income. If a person is not in the tax credit system, we do not make an assessment of household income and so have information only on individual income. Were we to try to do this on the basis of household income&#8212;I understand the argument made by hon. Members that that is the right thing to do&#8212;we would have to accept that that would involve putting everybody claiming child benefit into the tax credit system&#8212;all 8 million cases&#8212;which would be a substantial administrative burden on the state and on those individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.1/2">A number of points have been made in the course of the debate. Let me see whether I can pick up on those, rather than addressing every amendment. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> argued that it should apply only to a household income of &#163;100,000 or more. Not only would that result in the administrative challenge I have set out, but it would cost an additional &#163;900 million, which would be unaffordable as well as impractical.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> asked about providing information at constituency level. We can release the information by region, but the survey data are simply not good enough at constituency level. I can say that 63,000 people in Scotland will gain as a result of the changes we announced in the Budget, compared with the previously announced policy. She asked what the &#163;5 million for customer information will pay for. It includes provision for an online calculator and guidance for customers, and a letter that will go out in the autumn to all individuals above the higher rate threshold. We will also be updating existing guidance and testing it with customers, and there will be marketing spend to highlight the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch asked why the legislation refers to &#8220;high&#8221; rather than &#8220;higher&#8221;. He is right that &#8220;higher&#8221; is mentioned in some of the other documentation, but the point, which parliamentary counsel considered, is that &#8220;higher&#8221; begs the question, &#8220;higher than what?&#8221;, so we used &#8220;high&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.616.3/3">National Statistics assessment. Let me deal with the question the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun asked. Independent taxation will still apply, each partner will still have their own personal allowance and tax rate bands, and the amount of child benefit, even if it is received by the taxpayer&#8217;s partner, will not increase the amount of income liable to tax. Where there are two high earners in a household and they do not want to tell each other their incomes, there will be a mechanism whereby they can find out whether they have a higher or lower income but without the full details.</p>
	<p pid="a.616.3/4">Mr Hoyle, my time is up. As I have said, the Government have had to make difficult decisions. In order to continue to provide child benefit, we must do so in a sustainable manner. At the current cost that is not the case. We have increased the threshold to &#163;50,000 and put in a taper. This all mitigates some of the concerns that hon. Members have raised, but the budget deficit left by the previous Administration is the challenge we must overcome if we are to avoid a far worse predicament.</p>

	<p pid="a.617.0/1">I thank everybody who has participated in this spirited debate. Having heard the Minister&#8217;s explanation in relation to amendment 9, I will seek to withdraw it. Hopefully, we can have a vote on amendment 28, which deals with the injustice whereby a single-earner family earning &#163;60,000 will lose their child benefit while a family with two people earning &#163;50,000 will retain it. This issue will come back to haunt the Government, I fear. That sometimes happens when policies are drawn up on the back of a fag packet. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.617.0/5"><i>Amendment proposed</i>: 75, in clause&#160;8,&#160;page&#160;4,&#160;line&#160;35,&#160;at end add&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.617.0/6">&#8216;(2) Schedule 1 will not come into effect until a study has been carried out into ways of mitigating the impact of the Schedule on families with only one earner, compared with families with two earners, and placed in the Library of the House of Commons.&#8217;. &#8212;<i>(Cathy Jamieson.)</i></p>

	<p pid="a.630.1/1">I rise to present this petition from Mr Christopher Warren and Mr Duncan Hounsell, supported by more than 2,000 residents who live in and around Saltford in the county of Somerset.

	<p pid="a.630.1/4">That the Petitioners believe that re-opening Saltford station alongside the electrification and re-signalling programme that is due to take place on the mainline would be cost effective for the Department for Transport and would be beneficial for train users, and further that the re-opening of the station would enhance the case for the Greater Bristol Metro.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.1/5">Wherefore your Petitioners pray that your Honourable House shall urge the Government to take all possible steps to ensure that Saltford station is re-opened when reviewing the First Great Western rail franchise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.631.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40448" speakername="Mary Glindon" colnum="631"  time="018:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0004.htm#12041932002167">
	<p pid="a.631.2/1">Following a successful campaign by the British Legion&#8212;which I am pleased to say was supported by Labour&#8212;the House welcomed the announcement last May by the former Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, that there was to be an armed forces covenant which would be enshrined in law.</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/2">The duty to provide for the welfare of our armed forces goes back to the time of Queen Elizabeth I. In 1593 an Act was passed for the Necessary Relief of Soldiers and Mariners, and centuries later the debt owed by the state to our military personnel, who guard our treasured freedom with their very lives, has never diminished. The fact that in recent years our forces have been actively engaged in conflict throughout the globe, which continues to this day in Afghanistan, has given a heightened impetus to working for better terms of service for the armed forces, and making substantial improvements to their welfare and that of their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/3">Labour is proud of its record of achievement in defence matters. Under the last Labour Government, the defence budget increased by 10% in real terms. In the course of modernising our armed forces, Labour published, in 2008, the Service Personnel Command Paper and the Report of Inquiry into National Recognition of our Armed Forces. The aim was to develop cross-departmental measures to improve welfare provision and support for the forces, as well as evaluating the relationship between the armed forces and society. The resulting recommendations included proposals for a more systematic approach to homecoming parades, the creation of a British armed forces and veterans day, annual public outreach schemes, and civic education in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/4">At the same time, the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats both commissioned reports on the state of the military covenant, and many of the subsequent recommendations formed key pledges in their respective manifestos for the 2010 general election. However, the new coalition Government&#8217;s progress towards developing an armed forces covenant was overshadowed by the publication in October 2010 of the strategic defence and security review, which produced not just severe cuts in equipment programmes&#8212;for instance, the decommissioning of HMS Ark Royal and the scrapping of the Harriers&#8212;but massive cuts in personnel. At the time 17,000 job losses were announced; the number has subsequently increased to at least 22,000, but remains uncertain. The report of the independent Task Force on the Military Covenant was published in December that year, and its recommendations ultimately led to the announcement of the Government&#8217;s intention to enshrine the armed forces covenant in law.</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/5">It is now 11 months since the covenant was announced, but although an interim report has been produced, it has not been presented to the House. Can the Minister confirm that the House will receive the promised annual report on the implementation of the covenant, and that it will be presented to the House by November this year?</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/6">The shadow Defence Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" name="Gemma Doyle">the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)</phrase>, recently raised the issue of funding for accommodation with the Minister during Defence questions. That issue is of great concern to forces personnel and their families. Although the Government have put &#163;100 million into the budget for accommodation, they have already frozen funding for service accommodation for three years up to 2013. That means a total saving of &#163;141 million, and will result in a net cut of &#163;47 million. Can the Minister explain those figures, which clearly do not add up?</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/7">The announcement of the doubling of the welfare grant and the increase in council tax relief to 100% is good news for our armed forces personnel and their families. However, in order that neither members of the services nor their families are disadvantaged, will the Minister say when the moneys identified by Labour in the Department for Education&#8217;s budget, and agreed by the Secretary of State for Education, will be made available so that the education service premium of &#163;250 is not removed from children whose parents, sadly, have been killed in action?</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/8">In the 2010 comprehensive spending review, the Government announced that public sector pensions and benefits would be uprated using the consumer prices index measure rather than the retail prices index, and that that would be a permanent change. As a result, a disabled double-amputee aged 28 at corporal level would lose &#163;587,000 by the age of 70, and a senior non-commissioned officer&#8217;s widow would lose &#163;750,000 over her lifetime. Have these people not already lost enough? While it may be necessary to use the CPI measure to calculate the upratings in a time of recession, these examples show that there is no justification for denying our forces and their families their rights and is not in keeping with the spirit of the armed forces covenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/9">The armed forces covenant obligation involves the whole of society, including voluntary and charitable bodies, private organisations and individuals. Will the Minister say how other Government Departments are implementing their obligations under the covenant? Further, will he say which charitable organisations he is working with in order to meet the obligation?</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/10">The armed forces covenant states:</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/11">&#8220;Those who serve in the Armed Forces, whether Regular or Reserve, those who have served in the past, and their families, should face no disadvantage compared to other citizens in the provision of public and commercial services.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.631.2/12">While the obligation is a duty for the whole of society, the Government must take the lead. Those to whom we owe such a great debt should not be disadvantaged by the cost of the national debt. Without them, we may not have had the freedom to be able to hold this debate today. Labour will work responsibly and in co-operation with the Government on all aspects of national security and the welfare of our armed forces, but we will also continue to challenge the Government to ensure that the obligations under the armed forces covenant are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.632.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40448" name="Mary Glindon">the hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mrs Glindon)</phrase> on securing this</p>
	<p pid="a.632.0/2">debate on the armed forces covenant. I have discussed the subject rather a lot over the last two years, so I know a certain amount about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.632.0/3">I am delighted by the hon. Lady&#8217;s new-found interest in the covenant, and I am only sorry that she trotted out some old, incorrect and rather party political figures and arguments, because I had hoped that we could move on and discuss the positive achievements of the covenant. May I also correct her on the following point? We did not introduce the covenant into law because of any campaigns by anybody. It was a manifesto commitment, which was reiterated by the Prime Minister shortly after we took office.</p>

	<p pid="a.633.0/1">However, will the Minister acknowledge the part that the British Legion played?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.633.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" speakername="Andrew Robathan" colnum="633"  time="018:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0004.htm#12041932002170">
	<p pid="a.633.1/1">I talk to the British Legion the whole time, of course. Indeed, I saw the chief executive on Monday at a conference. We work very closely together, although I am sorry that the Labour party has said that they will be issuing joint press releases, as I think it is important&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Well, I have a document which I can show any Member who might want to look at it. It is important that all charities remain outside the party political arena, and that they are not in any way hijacked by a political party.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.1/2">Much has been said about the covenant, but I believe that actions speak louder than words, which is why we have placed in law a requirement for the Defence Secretary to report annually to Parliament, clearly setting out what has been achieved and how we are performing. Despite the hon. Lady&#8217;s criticisms, I think we are doing rather well, but there is still work to be done. As I have said innumerable times, we are building on the work of the last Government&#8217;s Command Paper; I do not think there is any disagreement on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.1/3">The Prime Minister chaired the inaugural ministerial committee meeting on the armed forces covenant, which I believe took place last month, although it could have been at the end of February. I regularly discuss the covenant with the Minister of State, Cabinet Office, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40648" name="Oliver Letwin">the Member for West Dorset (Mr Letwin)</phrase>, who is the Minister for government policy and is leading cross-departmental work. Indeed, I spent about an hour with him not more than three hours ago. It is also very encouraging to see how communities throughout the country are producing their own community covenants, including in the hon. Lady&#8217;s own constituency. I congratulate them on that, because it is an important step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.1/4">A key principle of the covenant is to tackle disadvantage incurred as a result of service. That is why, today, in a joint announcement with Royal Mail, we have launched a practical initiative to help those who are serving overseas by giving them the opportunity to apply for credit from UK institutions and to shop online. In the past, service personnel have experienced difficulty if they were living overseas due to the absence of a credit score or reference search based on a traditional UK address. From now on, British forces post office addresses will be recognised. That is the kind of relatively minor Government action, working with others, which makes a real difference to the lives of our service personnel and their families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-04-19a.634.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" speakername="Andrew Robathan" colnum="634"  time="018:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120419/debtext/120419-0004.htm#12041932002172">
	<p pid="a.634.1/1">I am sorry, but I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/2">Disadvantage can take many forms but let us not forget that members of the armed forces are also members of the community they serve, and it is only right that they should play their part in the very necessary changes we have had to make to reduce the deficit. Armed forces pay is frozen, as is that of all public sector workers, with the exception of those earning &#163;21,000 or less, to whom we have given &#163;250 in each of the two years of the pay freeze. I am glad to say that pay has also increased incrementally each year for those who are not at the top of their pay scale, and so serving personnel are getting increases, but not an overall increase in the pay scale. That protection was introduced for the armed forces to ensure they were not disadvantaged by their lack of contractual entitlement. This is in accordance with the principles of the armed forces covenant and has meant that most service personnel will have received an increase to their pay during the pay freeze period. I am sure that all hon. Members wish that the same was true of us, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/3">I have said to the House before that I did not enter Parliament to make members of the armed forces redundant, especially when we are asking them to do so much in Afghanistan, as we are now. However, we inherited a massive black hole in the Department&#8217;s budget, as has now been accepted by the Labour party. That was unsustainable, and something needed to be done and quickly. The strategic defence and security review of October 2010&#8212;the first in 13 years&#8212;set the requirement for the future. It included removing out-of-date capabilities and it made room to ensure that we can afford those capabilities needed for the future. The second and final tranche of redundancies for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will conclude in June. The Army will conduct a further tranche and detailed planning is being undertaken. Believe me, this is a painful process that none of us enjoys. As was clearly stated by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase> when he was Defence Secretary, no one currently serving in Afghanistan or on notice to deploy will be made redundant unless they have asked, and are subsequently selected, to be included in the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/4">The Government published, in December 2011, the interim report on the armed forces covenant, to which the hon. Lady referred, and I urge the whole House to read it. It was an interim report because the covenant had been in existence for only a few months, and therefore we could not have a whole year&#8217;s report. &#8220;Transition&#8221; is covered in chapter 10, as is &#8220;Housing after Service&#8221;. The Minister for Housing and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, has recently consulted local authorities on how former service personnel are managed on the local authority housing list. He will announce the findings of that consultation in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-21">21 March</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced three new measures to help service personnel. On housing, an extra &#163;100 million has been made available to improve service accommodation. In addition, a much-welcomed doubling in the funding available for families&#8217; welfare while their loved one is away will allow units to fund activities beyond those already announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/6">It underlines our commitment to those who serve with such selfless devotion to duty, safe in the knowledge that we are looking after their families while they are away.</p>

	<p pid="a.635.0/1">May I refer the Minister back to the figures that I mentioned in my speech? If the &#163;100 million will not be devalued, does that mean that the three-year freeze will be reduced to a two-year freeze so that that &#163;47 million will not be lost?</p>

	<p pid="a.635.1/1">We are continuing to refurbish bathrooms and kitchens, for instance, but we are not doing the wholesale modernisation as that has been stopped by the freeze. That &#163;100 million will go towards improvements and the modernisations that will go forward, but there is a freeze. There is a freeze for one simple reason: to quote the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the previous Government, &#8220;there is no money&#8221;. It is no good saying that we should spend more when we do not have any money.</p>

	<p pid="a.635.3/1">No, I am afraid that I will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/2">Thirdly, council tax relief has been doubled to just under &#163;600 for a typical six-month tour. That ensures that those who are doing so much to maintain our national security benefit the most. Although it is now old hat to say it, I repeat the fact that doubling the operational allowance for an operational tour means that every member of the armed forces who comes back from a six-month tour in Afghanistan comes back with approximately &#163;5,600, tax free, in his or her pocket. That is particularly good business for travel agents and car salesmen, I think, but it is a great gift and they deserve the money that they get. We are very pleased with that and I can assure the hon. Lady that when I have been in Afghanistan&#8212;one sometimes gets the odd ear-bending, if I can put it that way&#8212;I have heard that people are grateful for that large lump sum, which is deserved, when they come back.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/3">One of the most important aspects of the covenant is the way we treat those who have been injured or suffer from a debilitating health problem as a result of what we have asked them to do. Medical treatment in the battlefield is second to none and what was once an injury that would take a life is now much more survivable. Outstanding care continues at the Queen Elizabeth hospital and at Headley Court, where the determination of our people to get back to as normal a life as possible is impressively displayed. When one meets amputees who are going to climb Kilimanjaro, one is genuinely humbled. I know that that word is much over-used, but it really is very impressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/4">Some, sadly, will need a lifetime of care and we are committed to providing it. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> has produced two excellent reports and we are taking forward his recommendations, particularly those in his &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221; report on the mental well-being of our people. I am pleased to say that the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, has recently announced continued funding for the 24-hour helpline that was one of the recommendations. If anybody would like to ring it, as I have, they will discover that the person at the other end of the line knows what he or she is talking about and gives good signposting to those with mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/5">We are also working to introduce a veterans&#8217; information service. It will routinely contact service leavers 12 months after they are discharged to establish whether they have any health needs that require attention. The &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221; report refers to the service as something of a safety net to help veterans once the support structures available to them during their service lives are no longer readily accessible. To get it right, it is essential that we can easily identify ex-service personnel, so we are working with the Department of Health to ensure that a veteran&#8217;s status is properly recorded on his or her records. Equally, however, we must recognise that some who leave the services do not wish to have such a status recorded, and it is right to respect their individual wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/6">The hon. Lady particularly asked whether we will publish a covenant this year and we will do so in the autumn&#8212;in November, I would expect&#8212;not least because it is a statutory requirement and we believe firmly that we should obey the laws that we have passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.3/7">The armed forces covenant remains work in progress, but it definitely is progressing. We have already made significant gains and we are fulfilling our commitments made in the programme for Government. Much more is set out in the interim report to which the hon. Lady has referred, which I am sure she has read. However it is wrong to suggest that every time we have to make a difficult decision to repair the damage caused by the previous Administration, it is somehow a breach of that commitment. The covenant defines the principles of removing disadvantage and allowing special provision in some circumstances in the access to public and commercial services. This has set a framework for policy making and delivery across Government and will improve the support available for the armed forces community. Those who serve and those who have served deserve nothing less, even in the difficult times we face today.</p>
