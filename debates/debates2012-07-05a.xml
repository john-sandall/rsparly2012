	<p pid="a.1047.8/1">My hon. Friend puts his finger on an important point: the value of brands.

	<p pid="a.1047.9/1">My right hon. Friend will be aware that we export more food and drink to Belgium than we do to Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico combined.

	<p pid="a.1047.10/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right to use that statistic, which I have used many times. He is also right to say that I recently took a food trade mission to China, representing a number of sectors of the British food industry. The most important result was that we opened up the Chinese market to British pigmeat exports,</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.10/2">which the industry believes could be worth some &#163;50 million a year. What is interesting is that the industry would not just be exporting the conventional cuts that we eat in this country, because China has an appetite for other parts of the pig, sometimes called the fifth quarter, which will add value to many pigs, not just those exported as full carcasses. He is absolutely right about there being plenty of other opportunities. In particular, we are targeting the Russian market to complete the process of opening it up for the British beef industry.</p>

It is owned partly by the Forestry Commission and partly by the Ministry of Justice, which wants to site two 410-feet high wind turbines there, but the Forestry Commission has a policy of not objecting to schemes put forward by Government Departments unless there is a specific operational reason. Will the Secretary of State tell me who is responsible for evaluating the suitability and impact of these proposals on such sensitive sites?</p>

	<p pid="a.1048.6/1">Yes. We gave the Forestry Commission additional funds to assist with its restructuring, but, as the hon. Gentleman will understand, we inherited a situation in which the previous Government left us with a very substantial deficit and we have to set about clearing up the mess. That involves all DEFRA agencies playing their part, but we have provided assistance to the Forestry Commission on restructuring.</p>

To reiterate for the House and to make it perfectly clear, the public forest estate will remain in public ownership and there is no programme of sales, but, as I have just said in response to the question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon.

	<p pid="a.1049.3/1">This question would normally be answered by the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40418" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon)</phrase>, who is currently representing the United Kingdom at the International Whaling Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.3/2">We already have a network of 84 marine protected areas in English seas out to 12 nautical miles from the coast, and we plan to complete the set designated under the EU habitats directive this year. In addition, we are working to designate more sites under the EU birds directive and more marine conservation zones, as provided for in the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, to add to the network from 2013 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049.4/1">I am sure the whole House will wish to send its best wishes to the right hon. Lady&#8217;s colleague at the International Whaling Commission. I bear the scars of a number of those conferences and, in particular, I hope that the Under-Secretary delivers a tough message on the outrageous South Korean decision to resume so-called scientific whaling. No such thing exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.4/2">Marine protected areas are absolutely vital if we are to protect fish, seafood and other aspects of marine biodiversity in the seas around our coast, including around Devon. Their designation is already running two years&#8217; late, however, and there are worrying reports that the Government intend to reduce the number from 127, which the right hon. Lady&#8217;s own independent scientific advisory group said was the minimum required, to just 30. I hope that she can dispel those concerns now. Thirty would be totally inadequate; we need the 127 that her own advisory group recommends.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049.5/1">I will convey the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s encouragement to the Under-Secretary, because the negotiations are indeed tough when dealing with countries that still pursue whaling practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.5/2">May I put the matter of marine conservation zones in context? The Under-Secretary made a statement to Parliament in November last year, making it clear that an independent scientific review had found the evidence base for the designation of those zones to be insufficiently robust. I am sure the House wants the decision to be based on evidence and led by science, so we will not be rushed into making a decision without that additional evidence. On the figures in reports, the right hon. Gentleman should take them with a pinch of salt.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050.0/1">I welcome the introduction of further marine conservation zones, but does my right hon. Friend agree that the intention is not to put out of business those fishermen who engage in low-impact fishing, particularly mackerel handlining on the Cape bank off the Cornish coast.

	<p pid="a.1054.7/1">This week&#8217;s announcement of further price cuts for many dairy farmers, especially those who are not aligned to supermarkets, is a heavy blow, especially when global commodity prices seem to be rising again. I will be meeting industry representatives next week to hear their concerns.

	<p pid="a.1054.8/1">I thank the Minister for that answer, but he will know that the dairy industry is in crisis.

Is it not time that he intervened to impose a code of conduct, so that our dairy farmers get a fair price?</p>

	<p pid="a.1055.0/1">I fully understand the anger; it has been expressed to me by many farmers in the past few days. I am as concerned as my hon. Friend. However, as he knows, Ministers cannot and should not set prices. A compulsory code is provided for in the EU dairy package and we have said that we will consult on it. However, that would exclude a number of aspects that could be included in a voluntary code. That is why I still believe that a voluntary code is the better way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055.1/1">A year ago, our sympathies went out to the Secretary of State, who said that she was having sleepless nights over the plight of dairy farmers&#8212;no one wants to see a Cabinet Minister with bags under her eyes at the Dispatch Box. However, Ministers have slept soundly while milk processors, one after the other, have slashed farm-gate prices to dairy farmers below the cost of production. Will the Government act urgently on the calls from Labour and the National Farmers Union to allow farmers to exit contracts when price changes are made; do more to bring farmers together in producer organisations; and either bang heads together to strengthen the voluntary code and enforce it, or consider regulation of this dysfunctional supply chain? No more sleeping on the job, please.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055.3/1">Dairy farmers in Cumbria and across the country are being exploited appallingly by supermarkets and milk buyers of all kinds. They are now getting an average price per litre of 6p less than the cost of production. I am sure we all welcome the introduction of the groceries code adjudicator, which is real action to tackle the problem in the long term, but will the Minister take immediate action to call in the supermarkets and other buyers and tell them that the current situation is not only morally reprehensible but massively counter-productive? The low cost of milk under the Labour Government saw 50% of dairy farms close.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055.4/1">We have to look at the picture in the round. The reality is that most farmers on aligned supermarket contracts have not had their prices cut. The problem is with supermarkets and the other big retailers that operate in the middle ground, whose processors have continued to invest in new bottling plant and undercut each other for contracts instead of attacking growing markets both overseas and in import substitution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1059.3/1">We have to be realistic, and I want to be: no code of practice or compulsory contract will solve all the woes of the dairy industry. I believe that a voluntary code is better because the EU legislation on a statutory code restricts what can be in it to only a certain list of headings. A voluntary code would allow a wider range of headings. The stumbling block in negotiations appears&#8212;obviously I am not integrally involved, as this is a matter for the industry&#8212;to be over the period of notice that a farmer can give to leave a contract, if they do not like a price or other change, and over the period of notice that a processer can give the farmer. That is the point of difference, and the point on which I encourage both sides to find a compromise.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065.9/1">I made my own position very clear in a speech to the General Synod shortly after my appointment. I had hoped that the Synod would give final approval to the legislation for women bishops next Monday, but as a result of an amendment made by the House of Bishops in May, it is possible that the Synod will ask the House</p>

	<p pid="a.1066.0/1">Those of us such as the hon. Gentleman who have argued for a long time women to have equality in the Church and to be able to become bishops are getting a bit frustrated. I respectfully say that the objective he should communicate to his colleagues on the Synod is that during this year&#8212;either at the forthcoming Synod or the autumn Synod&#8212;a final decision should be taken. If there has to be a bit of compromise, so be it&#8212;but not on the principle. The differences of view need to be respected, but we need a clear decision on women bishops to be taken this year while this archbishop remains in office.</p>

	<p pid="a.1066.2/1">It is terribly sad that, yet again, the bishops have threatened this measure by trying to water it down. A couple of weeks ago, they accused this House of jeopardising the status of the established Church because we are likely to vote for equal marriage. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the bishops that establishment is a two-way street, and that by putting themselves so far away from mainstream opinion on women bishops&#8212;in this House, in the country and even in the Church of England&#8212;it is they who are threatening the established status of the Church?</p>

	<p pid="a.1066.3/1">I take the point, but let me say, in fairness, that I think the Archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops were trying hard to find a piece of territory on which they felt that everyone could stand. Many of us in the House are familiar with that concept. As the archbishop said, it is rather like one of those Christmas cracker games that involve trying to get three ball bearings into a hole: you always get two in, but one falls out. I think that a genuine attempt was made, but it obviously backfired, and we shall have to review the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1066.3/2">The House of Commons well understands the concept of ping-pong. I hope that if the General Synod sends this back to the House of Bishops, the bishops will reflect on what has been said by people including my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-05a.1069.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="1069"  time="023:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120705/debtext/120705-0001.htm#12070562002447">
	<p pid="a.1069.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for announcing next week&#8217;s business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/2">Last week I suggested to the right hon. Gentleman that, as Liberal Democrats and Conservative Ministers now spend their time rubbishing each other, it might be better if future parliamentary business were organised so that Government time was divided between the two parties to give both sufficient time to differentiate themselves from each other. I am delighted to see that the Leader of the House has quickly adopted my suggestion, because in announcing two days of debate on House of Lords reform next week, he omitted to draw the House&#8217;s attention to the fact that Government time had been so arranged to allow Liberal Democrat Ministers to speak on Monday and Conservative Ministers to speak on Tuesday. It will be interesting to monitor the differences of approach from one day to the next. Will the Leader of the House confirm that in future all Government business will be organised in this way?</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/3">We have learnt this week that Network Rail, a publicly funded body, is planning to pay millions in bonuses to senior managers. Government decisions mean that rail</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/4">passengers are facing fare rises of 11% a year at a time when people are struggling to make ends meet. It is simply unacceptable for Network Rail to pay out millions in bonuses to its top managers. Six months ago the Transport Secretary promised to appoint a public interest director, yet she has failed to do so. The Transport Secretary has the power to stop Network Rail bosses paying themselves massive bonuses at their annual general meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-19">19 July</phrase>. Will the Leader of the House confirm that the Government will block Network Rail&#8217;s plans, and arrange for the Transport Secretary to make an urgent statement to the House?</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/5">The Government have set up an independent inquiry into forests. That was done after 500,000 people signed a petition objecting to the Government&#8217;s proposal to flog off England&#8217;s forests to the highest bidders. The Government&#8217;s U-turn on the issue started a trend; they have been U-turning ever since. The inquiry report was published yesterday. Will the Leader of the House confirm that the Government have now dropped their plans to sell off 15% of English forests, and will he say when they will instead set out plans to protect and secure the future of our forests? Will he also arrange for the Environment Secretary to make an oral statement on the Government&#8217;s response to the independent inquiry?</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/6">The Government ask a bishop to hold an independent inquiry into the future of forests, but refuse to have an independent inquiry into the banking scandal. On Monday, the Government were against holding any inquiry; then they were in favour of a parliamentary inquiry, but against a parliamentary vote; then they were in favour of a parliamentary inquiry and a parliamentary vote, but still against an independent judicial inquiry. The Government have had three different positions in three days. May I urge the right hon. Gentleman to adopt a fourth? The British people want an independent judge-led inquiry, and all the Opposition parties want an independent judge-led inquiry. In fact, the only people opposing an independent judge-led inquiry are Government Members of Parliament and bankers themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/7">Something else the bankers wanted was for the Vickers report to be watered down, which is exactly what the Government have done. On Tuesday, Martin Wolf, the <i>Financial Times</i> economist and a member of the Vickers commission, described the Government&#8217;s decision not to implement the recommendation on high-risk derivative trading as &#8220;really quite serious&#8221;. Will the Leader of the House explain why the Government are watering down the Vickers commission recommendations, and arrange an urgent statement on this matter from the Chancellor?</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.3/8">May I congratulate the Leader of the House on his sterling performance in the recent ConservativeHome league table of Cabinet Ministers? The right hon. Gentleman has surged up the rankings. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Much to his surprise&#8212;perhaps he does not follow it&#8212;but he has. Conservative Members have put the Leader of the House in the premier league of Cabinet Ministers. However, the part-time partisan Chancellor, who has presided over a double-dip recession, has slumped into the third division. Does the Leader of the House have any tips on how the Chancellor can raise his game?</p>

	<p pid="a.1070.0/1">On the first issue, these two parties are working together harmoniously to repair the damage done by the Labour party. In the debate on the House of Lords on Monday and Tuesday, there will be a</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/2">seamless approach to the legislation from those who are opening and closing the debates on the first and second day. I remind Labour Members what their policy was when they were in government, and I hope, therefore, that they will support the Government on Monday and Tuesday, both on the motion on Second Reading and indeed on the programme motion. Through the latter, we propose to allocate 10 days in Committee, which contrasts with the four days they allocated on their Lords reform Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/3">The extraordinary corporate governance structure for Network Rail was actually set up by Labour; they are responsible for the decision-making process. We propose to reform it, and I will pass on the hon. Lady&#8217;s suggestion about the bonuses to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/4">So far as the forests are concerned, the hon. Lady will have seen the written ministerial statement from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The joke that we just heard from the hon. Lady was the same one we heard in DEFRA questions a few moments ago; I am sure she told it better. The initial response was set out in the written ministerial statement, and there will be a more substantive one next January. We have confirmed that the forests will remain in public ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/5">On the issue of a public inquiry, we are going to debate that. If the hon. Lady is asking for a debate on this issue, I have granted it, and very quickly. Our view, which will be set out later, is that any Committee should have the power to interview witnesses under oath; it should have the power to send for the necessary people; it should sit in public and have full access to the necessary documents and papers. We believe that a Joint Committee of the House will be able to discharge its responsibilities, and we will move on to that debate in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/6">We have not watered down the Vickers report. We are introducing a banking reform Bill, and in due course the House will have an opportunity to consider our proposals to separate the retail and investment wings of the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.0/7">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for bringing to my attention something I had not noticed before&#8212;the league table. One thing that is almost certain after her endorsement is that, next time, my position will be a lot lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071.1/1">Order. A very large number of hon. and right hon.

Therefore, it may not be possible for me to accommodate all contributors at business questions in the way that I would usually intend, but maximising the number of contributors depends upon brevity, which will now be exemplified, I know, by Miss Anne McIntosh.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071.3/1">My hon. Friend raises a key issue. We hope to publish very shortly the White Paper on social care together with a progress report on funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/2">I hope that when we do that, there may be an opportunity for a debate either at that time or subsequently. The issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible, and I think that Members on both sides of the House would welcome a debate on the future regime for social care along the lines my hon. Friend suggests.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072.0/1">Does the Leader of the House realise just how angry Yorkshire Members of Parliament from all parties are about the announcement that the Leeds children&#8217;s heart unit will close? There has been a vigorous campaign&#8212;the hardest fought that I have ever known in this House&#8212;and we have been ignored. Yorkshire has been downgraded in terms of this very important service for children.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072.1/1">Of course I understand the concern of Yorkshire Members at the outcome of the independent review, which was established by the previous Government at arm&#8217;s length from Ministers and has now reported. The key motivation was to drive up outcomes for children who suffer from congenital heart disease. There was powerful evidence that the more operations a surgeon performs, the better the performance, which improves the outcome for children. The review has been supported by the royal colleges as well as national charities. Although I understand what the hon. Gentleman has said, I think that the prime objective for us all ought to be to improve the outcomes for children who suffer from this serious disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072.2/1">More and more decisions both nationally and locally are being taken by unaccountable officials acting in a quasi-judicial role, leaving elected representatives powerless to influence them.

	<p pid="a.1072.3/1">My hon. Friend will have noticed that in the first Session of this Parliament, we introduced the Public Bodies Bill, which abolished a number of public bodies and repatriated to Ministers powers that had previously been devolved. I hope that he recognises that. The responsibility for the budget of non-departmental public bodies rests with Ministers, and although their day-to-day running has been delegated, the overall efficiency of the organisations remains a matter for Ministers. There will still be opportunities for him to hold NDPBs to account through the responsible Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072.4/1">We understood the need to move the Back-Bench business scheduled for today to make way for the important banking debate that is to be held this afternoon. As the Leader of the House has announced, we have now found slots for the displaced business by cutting it down quite finely and that would have been possible without the understanding and co-operation of all lead Members and participating Members. I want to put on the record my thanks for that co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.4/2">The Government have placed on the Order Paper for tonight a business motion that will make room for the air ambulance debate on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-11">Wednesday 11 July</phrase> after the debate on sitting hours, and I thank them for doing that.

I shall use my best endeavours to avoid statements on those two days, but I cannot give a cast-iron guarantee. The business motion on today&#8217;s Order Paper will safeguard two hours for the sitting hours debate on Wednesday and guarantee that the rest of the time until 7 o&#8217;clock is available for the air ambulance debate.

Will he table a motion to lift the 10 o&#8217;clock rule, because it would be a travesty if that debate was so over-subscribed that speeches were truncated? I remind him that Second Reading of the Bill on the Maastricht treaty was spread over two days and went significantly into the night, providing the opportunity for a great many more Members to participate.</p>

Friend and the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, and relay that message. The Government&#8217;s view on my hon. Friend&#8217;s second point is that a two-day debate on Second Reading is relatively unusual. I can recall only two such occasions in my time in the House, and I believe that a two-day debate on Second Reading, followed by 10 days in Committee and two days on Report, gives the House adequate time to debate that important issue.</p>

Last night, not for the first time, I and a number of other travelling passengers were invited to leave a bus and stand on the pavement because the driver had been instructed by his manager to turn the bus around before it reached its destination and return to its original point of departure. Those people were left abandoned on the street without any compensation and had to pay an extra fare.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-05a.1085.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40512" speakername="Philip Hammond" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="1085"  time="012:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120705/debtext/120705-0001.htm#12070562002530">
	<p pid="a.1085.1/1">Before I begin, I would like to pay tribute to the air crew from 15 Reserve Squadron, based at RAF Lossiemouth, who were involved in the Tornado GR4 aircraft accident on Tuesday&#8212;Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, who was killed in the accident, and Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, who are still missing and must be presumed dead. My thoughts, and I am sure those of the entire House, are with their loved ones at this difficult time and with the fourth member of the squadron involved in the incident, who is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/2">With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the future structure of the British Army. I know that I can speak for the whole House in expressing our gratitude for the superbly professional job that our armed forces are doing in Afghanistan and around the world and in paying tribute to their courage, commitment and self-sacrifice as they do so. We have seen again this week, in all too stark contrast, the risks that they take on our behalf, both in Afghanistan and at home, and the price that all too many of them pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/3">The operation in Afghanistan remains the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s top priority, but our combat role in Afghanistan is coming to an end&#8212;and with it, the predictability of the Army&#8217;s main effort. Looking beyond 2014, we need to restructure to face an increasingly uncertain world, ready to intervene whenever and wherever to protect our national interest and with an ability to project force and prevent conflict through &#8220;agile and adaptable&#8221; armed forces, as set out in the 2010 strategic defence and security review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/4">We also need to address the reality of the fiscal situation and to ensure that our armed forces are sustainable and affordable. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, announced in the House last July that, as part of the measures to bring the defence budget back into balance and to eliminate the &#163;38 billion black hole that we inherited from the last Government, the future strength of the Army would be around 120,000, including an integrated trained reserve of 30,000&#8212;a total trained strength not dissimilar to the pre-SDSR level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/5">So this statement is not about the size of the Army; that decision has already been announced. It is about how we structure the future Army and how we support it to deliver the greatest possible military effect within the manpower envelope available. The Chief of the General Staff could have taken the attitude that a given reduction in regular manpower must inevitably lead to a similar reduction in military capability. But he did not; he has grasped the opportunity presented by the end of the Afghan campaign to review fundamentally the structure of the Army and its relationships with the reserves and its commercial contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/6">A team led by Lieutenant General Nick Carter has produced &#8220;Army 2020&#8221;, a detailed plan for a future Army with two distinct elements: reaction forces and adaptable forces. The reaction forces will generate high-readiness contingent capability, trained and equipped to undertake the full spectrum of intervention tasks, including provision of forces for the first phases of any</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/7">future brigade-scale enduring operation. The reaction forces will be based around 16 Air Assault Brigade and three armoured infantry brigades, and equipped with new or upgraded armoured fighting vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/8">Given the high readiness of the force, it will be made up predominantly of regular troops. The reaction forces will form a powerful UK contribution to a coalition effort and act as the initial land component of a joint war fighting operation, alongside air and maritime components. At best effort, it will deliver a division into the field. The remaining infantry and armoured units will form the adaptable forces&#8212;a pool of regular and reserve units, commanded by seven infantry brigade headquarters, capable of generating forces for tasks including overseas capacity building; homeland resilience; the Army&#8217;s standing commitments, such as Cyprus, Brunei, the Falklands and ceremonial duties; and, when required, generating the further brigades to sustain any future enduring operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/9">Over a full career, soldiers and officers in infantry and armoured units will expect to serve in both reaction and adaptable forces. Both the reaction forces and the adaptable forces will include force troops&#8212;the artillery, engineers, signals, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, logistics, intelligence, medical and other specialist units on which the Army in the field depends and without which it could not function.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/10">To achieve that design while reducing the size of the Regular Army demands a much higher level integration of the regular and reserve components. In the past, the reserve may have come to be seen by some as an add-on to the Army; in future, the reserve will be a vital integrated component of the Army. The requirement for greater integration was a principal conclusion of the independent commission set up to review the UK&#8217;s reserve forces, led by the vice-chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton. I am most grateful to the members of the commission, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, for their work in producing that invaluable report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/11">I can tell the House today that we accept the thrust of the commission&#8217;s recommendations. In the interest of keeping this statement to a reasonable length, I have this morning laid a written ministerial statement setting out the detail of how we intend to proceed with our plans for enhanced reserves. But I can tell the House that the process of reshaping the reserves for their future role has already begun, and that I have set up an independent scrutiny team to assess its progress, led by retired Lieutenant General Robin Brims, chairman of the Council of Reserve Forces&#8217; and Cadets&#8217; Associations, who will make his first report in the summer of 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/12">Let me now return to the future structure of the Regular Army. In reducing the size of the Regular Army in line with the announcement made last July, there must inevitably be a reduction in the number of units. In headline terms, there will be 17 fewer major units as a result of this announcement. The reductions will fall across the various arms and services of the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/13">The importance of the regimental system to the British Army and its contribution to the fighting spirit that delivers a battle-winning edge is very clear. I understand the dismay, felt particularly by former members, at the withdrawal of units that may have illustrious histories and antecedents. I understand, too, the attachments of</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/14">the regions and nations of the United Kingdom to specific units within the British Army, and their justifiable pride in those units. In designing the new structure, the Army has sought to be sensitive to those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/15">But I am also very clear that the Army that emerges from the process must be a forward-looking, modern fighting machine, remaining best of its class&#8212;respecting the past and honouring its proud history, but looking resolutely to the future, with its principal focus being the brave men and women currently serving and the units in which they serve. The Army has approached this task methodically, carefully redesigning the way it delivers force support and building up a &#8220;whole force&#8221; concept that gives effect not only to the integration of the reserves but to the greater use of contractors, sometimes using sponsored reserves, to support operations, maximising the combat effect of the regular manpower available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/16">I should emphasise to the House that the withdrawal or merger of units is completely separate from the redundancy process. An individual in a unit which is withdrawn or merged is no more or less likely than any other individual with similar skills and service record to be selected for future redundancy. When units are withdrawn, their personnel are reassigned to other units, where possible within the same regiment. Nor does anything that I shall announce today prejudice the basing review that is looking at the optimum future basing pattern for our armed forces units around the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/17">I will list the changes to individual units. Starting with the force troops, 39 Regiment Royal Artillery, 24 Commando Engineer Regiment, 28 Engineer Regiment and 67 Works Group will be withdrawn. In the Army Air Corps, 1 Regiment and 9 Regiment will merge in preparation for equipping with the new Wildcat helicopters. In the Royal Logistics Corps, 1 and 2 Logistics Support Regiments will be withdrawn and 23 Pioneer Regiment disbanded, with its functions assumed by other units. In addition, 101 Force Support Battalion REME and 5 Regiment Royal Military Police will be withdrawn, with 101 becoming a reserve unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/18">Army 2020 calls for a greater focus on mobility and the ability to mount expeditionary warfare based around the air assault and armoured infantry brigades of the reaction forces. This evolution of our posture still further away from the cold war lay-down inevitably means a reduction in the size of the Armoured Corps from 11 units to nine. After careful consideration of all the factors, including regional distribution and the requirement for a balance of capability, the Army has decided that this will be achieved by an amalgamation of the Queen&#8217;s Royal Lancers with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers and a merger between the 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/19">Turning to the infantry, I can confirm that no current regimental names or cap badges will be lost as a consequence of the changes that I am announcing today. Five infantry battalions will be withdrawn from the Army&#8217;s order of battle, all of them from multi-battalion regiments. In selecting battalions for withdrawal, the Army has focused on the major recruiting challenges it faces in the infantry. It has looked carefully at recruiting performance, not just at a point in time but over the last decade; at recruiting catchment areas; and at demographic projections for the age cohort from which infantry recruits are drawn. It has also considered regional and</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/20">national affiliations, the merger and disbandment history of individual battalions, and existing commitments of battalions to future operations. The overriding objective has been to arrive at a solution that those currently serving in the Army will see as fair and equitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/21">The conclusion of this process has been that 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment and 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh will be withdrawn from the order of battle. In addition, the Royal Regiment of Scotland will see one battalion reduced to a single company. Ministers have agreed with the Chief of the General Staff that in order to raise the profile of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and of the Army, in Scotland, a public duties company will be created, returning sentries to Edinburgh castle and the palace of Holyroodhouse on a permanent basis for the first time in years. Accordingly, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be re-roled as a public duties company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/22">These withdrawals and mergers, unwelcome as I know they will be in the units affected, are fair and balanced and have been carefully structured to minimise the impact of the regular manpower reduction and maximise the military effectiveness of the Army. The reduction in regular forces will be offset by the enhanced role of the reserves and the &#8220;whole force&#8221; concept, which optimises the use of contractors in both peacetime and on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/23">The Chief of the General Staff and his team assess that this configuration will mean that Army 2020 can deliver the level of capability agreed in the strategic defence and security review. That is an excellent outcome given the appalling state of our inheritance at the Ministry of Defence, and I am extremely grateful to the Chief of the General Staff and the senior leadership of the Army for the constructive and intelligent way in which they have managed this process. What I have announced today, while difficult and challenging for those directly affected, represents a vision for the future&#8212;a vision of a balanced, capable and adaptable British Army that will remain best in class.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/24">The British Army has seen several transformations since the end of world war two&#8212;from wartime structure to cold war, from conscription to professional force, and the downsizing at the end of the cold war in &#8220;Options for Change&#8221; and &#8220;Front Line First&#8221;&#8212;and now it is embarking on another. The values of the Army have endured through previous transformations; they have sustained it through a decade of continuous campaigns. Those same values&#8212;courage, discipline, respect, integrity, loyalty, selflessness&#8212;will sustain it through this transformation; and, no doubt, through many further iterations in the decades and centuries ahead as this most enduring of British institutions looks confidently to a future in which it continues to adapt to an ever-changing world. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1088.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his statement and the courtesy of a briefing this morning in his office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/2">I join the Secretary of State in paying tribute to Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders. As he rightly says, our thoughts and prayers are with their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/3">Today&#8217;s statement is, correctly, long on detail but totally short of strategic context. New threats are emerging and weak and failing states outnumber the strong by two to one. There is an arc of instability from west African states to central and south-east Asia. Non-state actors are on the rise, and climate and population change are new sources of tension. The United States is pivoting towards the pacific while the European end of NATO will take greater strain. In that context, a statement that delivers plans for the smallest Army since the Boer war is an entirely inadequate response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/4">We can judge a statement not only by what is said but when it is said. This statement has been delayed deliberately to spare the Prime Minister&#8217;s blushes during Armed Forces day. He sought the reflected glory of the heroes while preparing to cut the prestige that they embody. This process has been chaotic, and the Prime Minister&#8217;s behaviour has been cynical and should never be repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/5">The British Army is an institution that is central to our national security as well as our national identity. The UK is cutting a higher proportion of our Army than many major allies. Indeed, France and Germany have higher net debt than the UK and yet they are cutting their forces by less. The SDSR announced cuts of 7,000 to the Army and new defence planning assumptions which stated that the UK could carry out one major and two lesser operations. Now, with a cut of 20,000, it is inconceivable that there will not be an impact on force projection, especially in the light of cuts to combat support and key enablers. I believe in the deterrent effect of the British Army and its ability to deploy, but for that to be effective, we need both flexibility and sustainability. The plans announced today may provide flexible forces, but it is far from certain that they will provide sustainable military utility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/6">Deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have rightly been controversial, and all of us, in all parts of the Chamber, are learning the lessons of those conflicts. However, it is one thing to take a decision never again in future to become involved in large-scale counter-insurgency operations, but when it is impossible to say that the next decade will be safer than the last, it is quite another to make a change to our defence posture that may mean that we could not make large long-term deployments even if we wished to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/7">Will the Secretary of State confirm that the SDSR planning assumptions that applied to an Army of 95,000 can no longer be guaranteed with a regular Army of just 82,000? We all know that tough decisions are necessary. We support the changes in the non-deployable administrative structure and the equipment programme, and the moves to tackle top-heavy structures. However, all who believed the Prime Minister when he said in opposition,</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/8">&#8220;We want to see the British Army increase in size&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/9">will be dismayed by today&#8217;s news.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/10">The Secretary of State had said previously that recruitment was a criterion for determining cuts. According to the honorary colonel of 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, his battalion is just nine short of full strength. He has said that this move</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/11">&#8220;cannot be presented as the best or most sensible military option.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/12">Further, some battalions have today lost their historic identities: the Green Howards, the Staffords and the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s. In Wales, there is a pyrrhic victory in saving a cap badge, but losing 600 people. The Argylls are being reduced to guarding castles and being the backdrop to Japanese tourists&#8217; photographs. Will the Secretary of State explain precisely the military grounds for the decisions on the Green Howards, the Staffords and the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s? How many of the 17 units being affected today are at full strength or within 5% of full complement? What specific additional measures can he announce today to help service leavers find work?</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/13">We support an increased role for our reservists, but 15,000 brilliant part-time reservists cannot fill the gap created by the loss of 20,000 full-time regulars. To many, that appears to be not a response to the threats, but a self-made capability gap. Will the Secretary of State make it clear that reservists will not form stand-alone units on operations, and say what proportion of the forces on enduring operations he envisages being made up of reservists? Some will see this as a military gamble, and it is undoubtedly an enormous employment challenge. Will he guarantee that the Government will consider new legislation to prevent more active reservists from being discriminated against in the workplace?</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/14">In conclusion, these decisions flow from a defence review that put savings before strategy. Our forces face a perfect storm. We are seeing the largest number of service leavers in a generation at a time of deep recession. Today, jobs and military capability have been lost, and tradition and history have been sacrificed. There will not only be a smaller Army; many believe that there will be a less powerful Army and that this will be a less influential nation. Our armed forces, their families and our country deserve better.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.2/1">We have been treated to a lecture on the strategic context by a member of a Government who did not conduct a strategic defence review in 12 years. We have been told about reductions in the Army by a shadow spokesman who wrote to his party&#8217;s leader saying that they would have to examine the structure of the Army and that he recognised the need for manpower reductions. The Labour leader wrote back to him saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/2">&#8220;we can expect to have to make further savings after the next election&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/3">What we have not heard from the right hon. Gentleman today is any kind of plan for how he would manage the &#163;38 billion deficit in the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s budget that we inherited from him&#8212;no plan, no clue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/4">Let me address some of the specific points that the right hon. Gentleman raised. He referred to Germany and France. Germany spends 1.2% of its GDP on defence, while this country spends 2.1% of its GDP on defence. He talked about France. France is only at the beginning of a fiscal review that will lead to the production</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/5">of a new livre blanc in the spring for the French armed forces. If he knows that there will not be cuts in the French armed forces, he is better informed than I and better informed than most of the French politicians and staff officers to whom I talk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/6">The right hon. Gentleman talked about sustainability. One of the achievements of the work that has been carried out over the past few months&#8212;it has been a huge piece of work&#8212;is the maintenance of capability through an intelligent approach to the challenge of doing more with less. We are using the reserves more intelligently, using our contractors more effectively and reshaping the Army&#8212;this process is about the shape of the Army in the future&#8212;to improve the tooth-to-tail ratio. We are ensuring that the manpower cuts are made in the areas that will have the least impact on the Army&#8217;s fighting capability. I assure him that the Army will be able to deliver the SDSR outputs required of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/7">The right hon. Gentleman talked about the strength of individual units. He referred to a leaked letter from the colonel of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The Army has looked at the recruiting ability of regiments and battalions not at a spot-point in time, but over a period of 10 years. It has looked at the demographic projections in the areas where the regiments and battalions recruit and drawn the appropriate conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/8">The right hon. Gentleman clearly does not understand how a public duties incremental company works. The 100 or so men who make up the PDIC in Scotland will be drawn in rotation from the other battalions in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, so no one will serve a career in the Army being, as he disparagingly put it, photographed by tourists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/9">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the arrangement of affairs within the regiments where battalions are being lost. He asked specifically about the Green Howards and the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s. When battalions are withdrawn, it is for the regiments to decide how the antecedents and the thread behind those battalions are merged into the other battalions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.2/10">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman referred to the reserves. We are talking about an Army reserve of 30,000 trained strength, not 15,000 as he mentioned. Reserves will be deployed on operations. That is what will give the Army its sustainability in the future. On an enduring operation, we would expect the first six-month tours to comprise less than 10% reserves, with the reaction forces making up the bulk of the land forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.1092.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. That final comment is the point: the Army gets things done. When it has to deal with a situation, it makes it work. He is right that key to the strategy is the effective integration of the reserves. There will be a new deal for reservists. There is ring-fenced money for kit and training in a way that there has not been in the past. That kit has already started to arrive. This year, reserve formations will train overseas. The number of units training overseas this year will be 26 and that will increase over time. Vital to this process are the integration of the reserves, the deal for employers and the deal for reservists, which involves a greater commitment on our behalf, but also expects a clearer commitment from them about their liability to deployment. I have published a written statement today that sets out further details on how we intend to take the process forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1093.1/1">I share the relief of many in the House that the cap badges and traditions of regiments and units will be preserved. However, in spite of the efforts of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I retain a certain scepticism that we can cut the professional Army by 20% with no impact on capability or on the policy options that might be available to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/2">My right hon. Friend seeks to separate the issue of the structure of the Army from that of its basing requirements. Again, I must respectfully disagree with him. The proposal that Typhoons should be transferred from Leuchars to Lossiemouth was based on the proposition that the Army required Leuchars because there was to be a multi-role brigade stationed in Scotland. Now we hear that no such brigade is to be stationed in Scotland. Is not that the final nail in the coffin of the proposal to move Typhoons from Leuchars to Lossiemouth?</p>

	<p pid="a.1093.2/1">No, it is not. It remains our intention to locate an infantry brigade in Scotland. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman will see when he looks at the brochure that the Army has produced, which is being circulated to Members, such brigades will be multi-role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.2/2">I want to tackle the right hon. and learned Gentleman on his point about capability. He questions whether a 20% reduction can possibly lead to no reduction in capability. The SDSR was already predicated on a reduction to a trained regular strength of 94,000. The challenge that the Army has taken on board is how to manage a reduction of a further 12,000 with the minimum impact on the outputs that it delivers. It has done that by using the intelligent approach of the &#8220;whole force&#8221; concept, with reservists and contractors playing a significantly larger role. The General Staff assures me that they can deliver the outputs required under the SDRS with that construct, and I believe them.</p>

This country will now have the capacity to fight only in coalition, with expeditionary forces, no enduring capacity and no surge capacity. How can the Secretary of State be sure that the people of Wales, and those of England and Scotland, will be willing to take part in the reserve forces? How can he be sure that employers will be willing to free their people for the reserve forces, and how can we be sure that this country will be able to defend itself with such a high level of reserves, which we have no assurance will actually be in place?</p>

The first reason is that we will guarantee them the training, kit, uniforms and equipment that they never had under the last Government. It is simply rubbish to say that we will have no surge capacity and no enduring capacity. I have just set out how the construct that the Army has put together will deliver us the ability to deploy a brigade-sized formation on an enduring operation indefinitely.</p>

If we want to rebuild the officer base of the reserve forces, at the core of that will be roles for formed bodies of men&#8212;units and sub-units&#8212;not simply the milking-off of augmentees, as has been happening for the past three years in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094.4/1">First, the positive news for people in the 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which is based in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, is that the regiment is under-recruited, so the merging of that battalion into the remainder of the regiment should be done without the need for a loss of personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.4/2">My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the integration of reserves. There will be a role for all three forms of use of reserves. Individual augmentees will continue to play an important part, delivering specialist skills in support of the reaction forces on an early deployment. However, formed sub-units, and in some cases formed units, will also be a vital part of how the adaptable force operates. That is one of the major changes being announced today.</p>

The thoughts of everybody in Moray and across the House are with their families, friends and colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.5/2">Turning to today&#8217;s defence announcement, the UK Government have already acknowledged that defence personnel in Scotland have been cut disproportionately in recent years&#8212;more than 27% in Scotland, compared with 11% in the UK as a whole. Today, those cuts continue. Although the retention of cap badges is welcome,</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.5/3">the Tories have broken their promise to restore the six Scottish infantry regiments.

Gentleman cannot deal with is that although he talks about a sixth regiment&#8212;I presume he means a sixth battalion&#8212;in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, the truth is that it has five battalions and has not been able to recruit to keep them up to strength. It is one of the most under-recruited regiments in the British Army. It is no good his asking for extra battalions and more regiments, because it cannot recruit to fill the ones that it already has. It also has one of the highest percentages of overseas-recruited troops in the British Army. That is the challenge that he faces before he can bring such issues before the House.</p>

Friend&#8217;s statement is an echo of the Geddes axe statement of the 1920s, for which the country, Europe and the rest of the world ultimately paid a very heavy price. One of the main reasons national service was abandoned was that it was decided that too many non-commissioned officers and too many of the best young officers of the Army had to be withdrawn from the fighting ranks to train 18-year-old national servicemen, who served for only two years. One thing that is absolutely certain is that the day will come when we need to increase our armed forces in some unpredictable crisis.

It is simply not helpful or relevant to compare the size of the Army now with that of 50 or 100 years ago. The capabilities&#8212;equipment, connectivity, communications and firepower&#8212;of an infantryman in the field today are an order of magnitude different from those of infantrymen of the past. I come back to two simple facts: first, both the country and the MOD inherited a fiscal disaster; and, secondly, we must reconfigure the structure of our forces to deal with the threats we will face in future, not the ones we faced in the past.</p>

Today&#8217;s statement has not been underpinned by a strategic analysis of the world in which we operate. It depends on a much greater reliance on our reserve forces, which carries real risk, and the process has increased uncertainty and doubt among our forces and their families.

	<p pid="a.1097.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asks about people who will remain in the forces. I hope to be in a position very soon to make an announcement about the military pension scheme, and we are well advanced in designing what the military calls the new employment model, which will set out more clearly our offer to military personnel, including how we can make the remuneration package that underpins the armed services more flexible and responsive to the needs of individuals than it has been in the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.1097.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is critical that we make the Army sustainable by dealing with the underlying fiscal chaos that we inherited. Labour did not deal with the equipment programme but simply pushed the problems further to the right, building up a larger and larger bubble of unfunded theoretical projects that would never be delivered. That does not help anyone. He is correct, of course, that the ability to regenerate is critical to the Army&#8217;s strategic resilience. We do not know what will happen in five or 10 years, so the ability to regenerate capability is our greatest protection for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098.2/1">Yes, she has. The statement is not about individuals losing their jobs but about the structures within which individuals will serve. The disbandment or withdrawal of a regiment or battalion does not mean that the individuals in it will lose their jobs. As the Army works on its manning plan over the next couple of years&#8212;there will be further tranches of redundancy&#8212;people will be able to move across the Army to fit the newer structure. The hon. Lady asked me how I arrived at the decision. I did not arrive at the decision: the Army arrived at it. The Army has done the modelling work, and the Army has come to the conclusions. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Opposition Members do not like a Government who listen to the professionals running our military, our health service or our schools. They are used to a model based on political interference from the top down. That is not the view of this Government.</p>

First, timing is central. Will the TA be built up before the regular forces are reduced? Secondly, is there room for transfers from the regular forces into the Territorials?</p>

	<p pid="a.1098.4/1">I think I mentioned that one of the units being withdrawn will become a TA unit. Of course, people leaving the regular forces are always most welcome to join the reserves. My hon. Friend&#8217;s point about timing is important, and the process of building up the reserves has already begun. A recruiting campaign was launched over the Christmas-new year period, and further campaigns are in hand. We expect there to be a steady build-up in the reserves between now and 2018.</p>

Friend: it will be hardest to recruit from among small and medium-sized employers, because public sector and large corporate employers are much better able to offer the flexibility that reservists need, and much better able to see the benefits of having reservists in their employment. There is also considerable potential among the self-employed&#8212;people who perhaps carry out consultancy work&#8212;with the offer of much more predictable periods of training and deployment, which would enable them to plan for those deployments as part of their self-employed career. We will seek to recruit from SMEs but it will be the most difficult part of the ask.</p>

Not only does the decision to cut the Army by a fifth smack of accountants running amok, but the decision to axe the better recruited English battalions, such as 2RRF, at the expense of the more poorly recruited Scottish battalions smacks of a grubby political fix, given the advent of the Scottish referendum. If the Government cannot make the right decision within the MOD budget, will they at least source funds from the ridiculous &#163;1,200 million that we are sending in aid to India?</p>

Friend will have to take up issues about the allocation of budgets between Departments with the Chancellor the Exchequer, but I can tell him&#8212;because his comments appear to be drawn directly from the leaked letter from the colonel of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers&#8212;that he is simply wrong to describe the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers as one of the best recruited regiments in the Army. If we look at the position over a 10-year period and at the demographics going forward, along with all the other issues that the Army has set out as criteria to be taken into account, the conclusions are clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.1103.0/1">No. We looked at the option of reducing the size of battalions, so as to avoid the need to withdraw them, but that would have created a tremendous inefficiency. It would have created a top-heavy structure with, proportionately, a large amount of expenditure going on administration. It is simply not right, I am afraid, to talk about the Yorkshires as a regiment that has historically been well recruited. It is a regiment that has had difficulty in recruiting historically. Looking over a 10-year period&#8212;the Army does not look at a point in time&#8212;the Yorkshire Regiment has been under-recruited consistently.</p>

	<p pid="a.1105.3/1">Welsh soldiers who have risked their lives and lost their friends in Afghanistan now face the sack. We heard this morning in the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from military and academic experts that the Welsh forces should not be the first to be considered in this programme. We should consider the ceremonial forces, the Gurkhas and the Scots. Alongside that, the provisions of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill will make it much more difficult to recruit people working in small businesses because of the end of tribunals. Does the Secretary of State accept that this is a grubby political fix, and that he will not be able to recruit people into the Territorial Army because of the changes that will make it easier to sack people?</p>

The facts came to light only subsequently, and they are now being properly investigated. I hope that that serves as a full answer to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113.7/1">Here we go again, Mr Deputy Speaker. The reason we advocate an open public inquiry, judge-led, is precisely in order to get to the bottom of all these things.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.7/2">Given the direction in which the debate is now going, before I set out the arguments before us today let me just say this to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The cheap, partisan and desperate way in which he and his aides have conducted themselves in recent days does him no good; it demeans the office that he holds; and, most important, it makes it harder for us to achieve the lasting consensus that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.7/3">I have to say that what we have seen in the last few days makes the case more eloquently than any speech that I could deliver, or any speech that any of us could deliver, for an independent, arm&#8217;s length public inquiry to elevate this debate above the deeply partisan tone set by the Chancellor and his colleagues. As for the false personal accusations that the Chancellor has made against me, not on the basis of any evidence but purely in the hope of political advantage, he said yesterday&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Members should listen to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.7/4">The Chancellor said yesterday that I was &#8220;clearly involved&#8221; in communicating with the Bank of England and Barclays in October 2008 concerning the LIBOR market, a claim that his aides repeat. He made that utterly baseless accusation before any proper investigation, before any witnesses had been called and before any papers had been examined. He did not say it to an inquiry; he said it yesterday to <i>The Spectator</i>. If he has any evidence, he should produce it now, in the House. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If he will not&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

In the last 24 hours, we have had the shadow Chancellor say it might have been Treasury Ministers at the time, and we have had the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer say they definitely were not from the Treasury, but maybe from elsewhere in Government. Will the shadow Chancellor explain what Labour&#8217;s involvement was? Who were the Ministers? Who had the conversation? Who were the senior figures? Let him answer for his time in office.</p>

	<p pid="a.1115.5/1">I will not give way now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/2">The reality is that we must all admit that regulation should have been tougher, including those who argued for less regulation. I say to the Chancellor that I will await, and press for, his withdrawal and apology day after day until I get it. All of us on both sides of this House need to show a little more humility, including the Chancellor&#8212;and the Prime Minister, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/3">I am more than willing to attend an inquiry and answer any questions. What the public will ask about this Chancellor and this Prime Minister as they listen to this debate is, why are they not prepared to do the same in the public interest? That is the question they will ask.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/4">Let me turn to the motion. The Government have three declared objections to a judicial public inquiry: scope, speed and form. Let me take each in turn. First, on scope, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor argue that we have already had the Vickers commission on banking, which reported last September, and now the Financial Services Authority will report. They say we do not need to have a more broad-based inquiry that, in their view, will lead to more uncertainty. &#8220;Get on with it,&#8221; they say, and it is right that there are a number of</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/5">important questions that need to be asked about the LIBOR scandal, not least why, when this market was investigated by the British Bankers Association in 2008, the then chair, now Lord Stephen Green, gave it a clean bill of health. We need to look at these issues, including, if the Treasury and the BBA urged tougher regulation when they discussed LIBOR on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-05">5 March 2012</phrase>, when the Financial Secretary was asked the next day in Committee whether we needed a change in law, why did he say no? These are important questions that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/6">The issues go much wider, however. A member of the Vickers commission said earlier this week that</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/7">&#8220;banks, as presently constituted and managed, cannot be trusted to perform any publicly important function, against the perceived interests of their staff. Today&#8217;s banks represent the incarnation of profit-seeking behaviour taken to its logical limits, in which the only question asked by senior staff is not what is their duty or their responsibility, but what can they get away with.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1115.5/8">That is what a Vickers commission member says.</p>

	<p pid="a.1116.0/1">Given all the banking scandals to which my right hon. Friend has alluded, how will the banks be able to play a fundamental and trustworthy role in the economic growth and future of this country without our having an independent judge-led inquiry?</p>

	<p pid="a.1116.1/1">That is a very important point. Banks play a very important role in our economy. Hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on our retail and global wholesale banking industry. It would be very dangerous to take risks with that industry and those jobs. It makes no sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I say to the Chancellor, and those who use the importance of our financial services industry as an argument against a broad-based inquiry, that they badly under-estimate both public anger and what needs to be done, because banking is a profession which above all needs trust, and that trust is currently badly undermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/2">The Chancellor said earlier this week:</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/3">&#8220;We know what went wrong&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-02.613"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2012; Vol. 547, c. 613</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/4">When the public hear that, I do not think they believe him. That is the problem. In the light of recent events, when they find out that the Government have decided, against the recommendation of Sir John Vickers, to allow complex derivatives inside the retail bank ring fence, they think, &#8220;Well, could this allow the appalling mis-selling to happen again?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/5">Let me quote to the House the comments of Mr Martin Wolf, a member of the Vickers commission, who was asked last week whether he agreed that any sort of derivative should not be sold to a retail bank. He was asked whether they should be kept separate, and he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/6">&#8220;We wanted to separate them completely and the Government has gone back on that and we think that is really quite dangerous. It leads to the very serious risk of mis-selling which we have seen has been a constant theme of the relationship between retail banks and relatively inexperienced, uninformed clients.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.1/7">That is right, and that is why a LIBOR inquiry is not enough. We need to look at these Vickers issues as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117.0/2">It is our view that a comprehensive review of the whole culture of banking must start with the conduct of bankers and traders, look at the institutions in which they operate, and cascade outwards into the rules, corporate governance, industry approaches and regulatory and legal frameworks in which banks have done business in past decades. There are many important, searching questions that we need to answer, and the only way to answer them&#8212;I have them here, but for reasons of time I will not go through them all&#8212;is through the broad-based inquiry that we need, not a narrow, LIBOR-based inquiry.</p>

It is clear from what he says that he desires that the preliminary part of his judicially led inquiry should produce recommendations on the lessons to be learned from the scandal of the manipulation of LIBOR as quickly as possible and by the end of the year. The question whether there is to be a criminal investigation is not in my hands or, indeed, those of anybody in this House.

	<p pid="a.1120.1/1">My hon. Friend is right, and I fear that the Attorney-General has just completely destroyed the basis of his own Government&#8217;s parliamentary inquiry. We know from experience that when the subject of a public inquiry overlaps with the prospect of criminal charges and trials, only a judge has the legal skills and credibility to conduct that inquiry without crossing the line of what is acceptable. That is what Lord Leveson showed and that is what parliamentary inquiries have been unable to do on phone hacking.</p>

	<p pid="a.1120.2/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. So far as the Leveson inquiry is concerned, that question was recognised at the time that it was set up. It is for that reason that it was split in two. Lord Justice Leveson has been at great pains to avoid interfering with the process, but the process contemplated in the motion tabled by the right hon. Gentleman and others envisages, as I read it, that the part of the inquiry dealing with the scandal of manipulation should take place at once. I have made the point as to why I think that that is extremely difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman then raised a second point, which was that that argument could also apply to referring the matter to a Joint Committee of both Houses. If I may say so, he is correct in that. It could present such a difficulty, but I note that there is no prescriptive timetable laid down for the working of the Joint Committee and I have no doubt&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am sure that despite parliamentary privilege the Joint Committee will have to adapt to any criminal investigation or inquiry that takes place. However, that makes no difference to the fact that, as drafted, the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s motion appears to me to have a fundamental problem associated with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1120.3/1">I hear the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#8217;s points and I only wish the Prime Minister would talk to his own legal adviser. As far as I can see, the Attorney-General has entirely torpedoed the inquiry, which we were told yesterday would conclude by Christmas. If he is saying that the inquiry can take longer in order to deal with the issue of criminal charges, what does that make of the Prime Minister&#8217;s argument that the only reason for doing it this way was to do it faster? It is utterly incoherent. I am not saying in any way that the Attorney-General is being incoherent&#8212;it is just the Chancellor and the Prime Minister who have completely lost their grip on this whole process.</p>

The confusion is that the timetable that we have set down for our first-stage judicial inquiry is exactly the same as that which the Government announced for their parliamentary inquiry. If it is too short for one, how can it be the right length for the other? More than that, my argument was that when we are discussing complex issues that require fine legal judgment, the idea that judges would make that fine legal judgment in a worse way than a parliamentary Committee is nonsensical. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has done a very great service to this House. I had four objections to the form of the inquiry, but it has been torpedoed while I am only halfway through.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122.1/1">I am extremely grateful to the shadow Chancellor for giving way. On the question of the alternatives of a Select Committee and a judicial inquiry, it is perfectly clear that we can make any necessary adjustments through our Standing Orders on such issues as taking evidence on oath, for example. I will seek to explain that in more detail if I get the opportunity to make a speech.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-05a.1122.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" speakername="Edward Balls" colnum="1122"  time="013:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120705/debtext/120705-0002.htm#12070562002741">
	<p pid="a.1122.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has proposed that a QC could advise the Committee; perhaps he will make that proposal later. Those important points take us down the road towards the judicial inquiry. The problem is&#8212;and this is my third objection&#8212;that experience shows that only a judge-led inquiry can ensure the necessary forensic cross-examination of witnesses, prevent witnesses from avoiding answering key questions that are important for establishing the truth and, in particular, avoid blanket refusals to answer questions on grounds of legal advice. I would be happy to take an intervention from the Attorney-General on this point, because we have seen it happen in parliamentary hearings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122.2/2">The argument is that a witness before a parliamentary inquiry can say on legal advice that they will not answer a question, but in a judge-led inquiry the judge has the ability to explain to the witness why answering the question in the particular form set by him according to his legal judgment will not cross the line. Unless a judge is properly testing the boundary between self-incrimination and the answers that must be given for a proper inquiry, we cannot make progress. That would be doubly the case with the prospect of criminal investigations, which might take some years down the track. On the question of witnesses not incriminating themselves, it seems to me that the evidence shows&#8212;perhaps the Attorney-General will correct me&#8212;that it is impossible for a parliamentary inquiry to call any witness who might be implicated in the LIBOR scandal without the witness saying, &#8220;On legal advice, I will say nothing.&#8221; The inquiry cannot work like that. Only a judge can sort this out.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122.3/1">Does the shadow Chancellor accept that a Select Committee can ask a witness to release information covered by client-attorney privilege, as the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport did in the phone-hacking inquiry? That information cannot be requested by a public inquiry because it is covered by the same remit as a civil court. A parliamentary inquiry can request and receive information that a public inquiry cannot and, in the case of the phone-hacking inquiry, that led to the production of the most significant information of the entire inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122.4/1">All my experience&#8212;and there are many Members on both sides of the House who have more detailed experience than I have&#8212;is that Select Committees find it much harder than a judge-led inquiry to secure</p>
	<p pid="a.1122.4/2">the release of necessary and essential documents and, more importantly, to find out which documents they should ask for in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122.4/3">Finally, and above all in our view&#8212;and I note that the Attorney-General did not correct me on the calling of witnesses, but perhaps he will advise the Chancellor for his speech&#8212;only a judge-led inquiry can truly persuade the public that the inquiry is properly independent and objective and, given the Chancellor&#8217;s behaviour, non-partisan.</p>

He says he wishes to have a judge-led inquiry, and he gives some perfectly good reasons&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> These are matters of debate. He has been quite unable to explain how, in the light of the fact that at the same time there is a desire for a criminal investigation, those two can be reconciled. He has come to the Dispatch Box to criticise the Government for their approach, so that is a question he ought to be capable of answering, or receiving legal advice on how to answer it. It is a real problem, not an artificial or concocted one, and he has not provided that answer at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.1123.5/1">It is a pity not only that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was not consulted before the inquiry was announced but that he is not leading for the Government today instead of the part-time Chancellor, as that would probably be a more enlightening debate. Let me repeat exactly what I said in my speech. When the subject&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am going to answer the question, but it does not help if the Treasury Whip shouts from a sedentary position. If he wants to join the Chancellor and withdraw his allegations he can do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123.5/2">Let me repeat my answer to the question. When the subject of the public inquiry overlaps with the prospect of criminal charges and trials, it is our judgment that</p>
	<p pid="a.1123.5/3">only a judge, as we have seen in the Leveson inquiry, has the legal skills and credibility to conduct that wider inquiry without crossing the acceptable line. A parliamentary Committee will never be able to do so. The reality is that there will be stalemate&#8212;witnesses not answering questions, documents not revealed&#8212;and we will not make progress. We adopted the Government&#8217;s timetable for the first stage of the inquiry, because we thought they had thought it through, but it turns out that they had not done so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124.1/2">Let me summarise the case for a public inquiry as simply as I can by quoting from a higher authority. Let me quote from a call for an independent public inquiry on banking:</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.1/3">&#8220;Is not the truth that in Britain people are losing their homes, small businesses are closing, unemployment is rising and manufacturing output is falling again and that, by refusing to hold a public inquiry, the Prime Minister is yet again demonstrating that he cannot provide the change people want?&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-11-05.247"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 247</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.1/4">I could not have put it better myself. But those are not my words. They are directly from the right hon. Member for Witney&#8212;Cameron direct. I checked this morning and the quote is still on the Conservative party website, under the headline, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t the Prime Minister hold a public enquiry?&#8221; It even has a photo of the current Prime Minister there for us all to see. He said we need an independent inquiry. That was on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-05">5 November 2008</phrase>. How things have changed, for all of us. I know that the Prime Minister makes such a virtue of consistency, so I hope he will join us in the Lobby tonight for another Treasury U-turn&#8212;they just keep coming for this Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.1/5">Let me turn to the votes. I have set out three concerns&#8212;scope, speed and form&#8212;which we are told are the reasons the Government object to our proposal for an independent judge-led inquiry. I have explained why we do not believe that any of these arguments stack up&#8212;to be honest, the Attorney-General has been very helpful in this regard. We urge hon. Members to think hard. I said I would take an intervention from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>, so I will take that first.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124.2/1">I am grateful to the shadow Chancellor, a fine Nottingham boy, and I am enjoying his contribution. We all agree that this is an outrageous scandal and we need to get to the bottom of it, but does he not also agree that out there in the real world people want to hear a little acceptance of responsibility and a little contrition from him, because he was a member of the Government when this scandal happened and it was on his watch?</p>

	<p pid="a.1124.3/1">Despite trying to intervene, the hon. Lady has been listening to my speech and so will have heard me say that mistakes were made and humility is needed from Members on both sides of the House. As a former barrister, she will also know, as will many Members on both sides of the House who have worked in the law, accounting or financial services, that the highest standards</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.3/2">of integrity not only are necessary, but need to be seen if they are to command public confidence. That is the argument for our inquiry. I ask her and hon. Members on both sides of the House to think hard and support our motion today to put the banking industry on a sound footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.3/3">We hope to win the argument this afternoon. We aim to persuade hon. Members to vote with us and support our motion. We recognise that the Government have a majority and intend to whip the vote tonight. If our motion is unsuccessful and the Government railroad through a parliamentary inquiry&#8212;they may be reconsidering now&#8212;we will continue to make the case for a full judicial inquiry. If further banking scandals emerge, as I fear they will, people will look back at this moment and conclude that the Government failed to grasp the opportunity.</p>

If questions are raised, in an open judicial inquiry, about past regulatory decisions, that is right and proper; if they are raised about decisions made in the mid-1980s, that is right and proper; and if questions are raised about the financing of political parties and where donations comes from, that is right and proper as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1125.1/2">We should have no fear of answering those questions, but, from what we have heard from Government Front Benchers, we know that the Government have no intention of holding such a full, open, public inquiry; they want an inquiry on the shortest timetable and in the narrowest way. The Attorney-General has told us why one cannot be held on a timetable for completion by Christmas, but let me remind him what the Prime Minister said on Monday:</p>

	<p pid="a.1126.7/1">The Attorney-General is not right on that issue. It is far more dangerous to have a parliamentary inquiry, because article 9 of the Bill of Rights says that no court can impeach a proceeding in Parliament. Some witnesses who might want to evade justice might, therefore, choose to come to a parliamentary Committee to say things, so that they do not then get sued in court.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126.8/1">I understand the points made by Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.8/2">Before I summarise, let me say to the Attorney-General that I have tried to listen very carefully to his contributions. There have been many of them, all have been helpful and constructive and they have helped us to understand the challenges that we face rather better than we had done on the basis of the Chancellor&#8217;s contributions in recent days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.8/3">Let me say also that, if at any point I misrepresent the right hon. and learned Gentleman, I will always in an honourable way correct the record in this House&#8212;not, as we now know, a standard of behaviour that we can expect from the Chancellor in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.8/4">To summarise, the argument goes as follows. Point one is that the Attorney-General does not believe that it is possible to have a proper, thorough investigation into all the details of the LIBOR market by the end of the year. I understand that; I hear his argument. Our argument is that a judge-led inquiry gives us a better chance of having an investigation into something legally sensitive than a parliamentary inquiry. If one is true and two is true, that means that the Government&#8217;s proposal for a parliamentary inquiry by the end of this year is defunct&#8212;dead, torpedoed, gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.8/5">That is why, rather than intervening again, the Attorney-General should speak to the Chancellor, call the Prime Minister&#8212;wherever he is&#8212;and say that they should withdraw these motions, get to the drawing board and come back with a plan that is baked rather than half baked. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Plan B!&#8221;] Plan B.</p>

Set against the depths of malpractice that have now been revealed and the scale of the challenge that we face, our strong belief is that the Government&#8217;s decision to reject our call for an independent and judge-led public inquiry is a grave mistake. Only an independent and open public inquiry&#8212;not politicians investigating bankers&#8212;can rebuild trust. That is our view, and the view of many Opposition Members.

	<p pid="a.1130.3/1">I want to take the Chancellor back to his comments a few moments ago in which he quoted something that had been said by Mr Diamond before the Treasury Committee. Is not part of the problem that that format does not get to the bottom of these issues? Statements of a general nature were made about some discussion that took place with certain Ministers. Do we not need a judicial inquiry?</p>

The people who were in the Treasury are blaming the people who were in No. 10, and the people who were in No. 10 are blaming the people who were in the Treasury. Why do they not take responsibility collectively for the absolute mess that they made of regulating our banks, including the LIBOR market, during their time in government?</p>

	<p pid="a.1131.1/2">We all agree that, in the words of the FSA, Barclays</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/3">&#8220;failed to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/4">failed to</p>

	<p pid="a.1131.1/6">and failed to</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/7">&#8220;observe proper standards of market conduct&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/8">We all agree that the misconduct of Barclays created the risk that</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/9">&#8220;confidence in or the stability of the UK financial system would be threatened.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.1/10">We can also agree&#8212;this is material to the point about whether there should be a judge-led inquiry or a parliamentary inquiry&#8212;that the FSA and the Department of Justice in the United States have done a very effective job in identifying what went wrong after the event. Sadly our regulators failed to see it coming, but the job afterwards has been effective. Now, I think we can all agree that we want the prosecuting authorities to see whether there are legal routes that they can take to bring proceedings against those involved. That is of course a matter for them. In this very partisan debate, that at least is a matter of consensus.</p>

	<p pid="a.1131.3/1">We heard from the Attorney-General that a judge-led inquiry may, in his words, not even get off the ground. The idea that we cannot have a parliamentary inquiry is obvious nonsense, because yesterday the Treasury Committee questioned Bob Diamond on the LIBOR scandal. Of course it is entirely possible for a parliamentary inquiry to take place. Our motion will enable us to get an inquiry under way and assuage the anger of the people of Northern Ireland and the rest of the country.</p>

He will work swiftly and report this summer, so that the Financial Services Bill, which is currently before Parliament, can if necessary be amended and the regulators can acquire the new powers that they need. Yesterday, he responded to the damning FSA report into the failure of RBS with plans for new sanctions for the directors of failed banks, including the possibility of criminal sanctions.

That is precisely one of the things we need to look at this year to see whether we can amend the law this year. The second point I would make to address the point she makes from a sedentary position is that the SFO is completely independent of the Government of the day. It is actively looking at what criminal powers are available to it. The director of the SFO has said that he will be able to tell us how he will proceed by the end of the month. The hon. Lady wants to persuade me that the law unfortunately does not give us all the criminal sanctions we need to deal with financial crime in the way that we deal with crime on our high street, but I absolutely agree with her.

	<p pid="a.1133.3/1">I have already given way quite a lot. I shall make some progress and then give way again. I want to come to the heart of the issue dividing the House today: the question of whether we should have a public judge-led inquiry or a parliamentary inquiry. The Opposition have completely forgotten that one of the first things the Government did was to set up an independent inquiry under John Vickers&#8212;the independent commission on banking&#8212;that took evidence in public and comprised a panel of experts who came forward with proposals to ring-fence the retail banks and completely change the structure of banking. That was never proposed, let alone enacted, in 13 years of a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133.3/2">We have already had an independent inquiry into the structure of banking. The question, then, is what type of inquiry we should now have into the professional standards and culture in the banking industry. Let me explain why I think a public judge-led inquiry would be a mistake and why a parliamentary inquiry is the right approach. First, there is a general principle that judge-led inquiries be used when other forms of investigation have completely failed. Of course, everyone here has mentioned the Leveson inquiry, but that was set up because of the failure of police investigations. In Ireland, the Bloody Sunday inquiry was set up because of the community&#8217;s anxiety about the investigations into Bloody Sunday. No one here doubts that the Financial Services Authority and the US Justice Department have been</p>
	<p pid="a.1133.3/3">effective in trying to find out what was happening on the trading floor of Barclays when these things took place. There is no question, therefore, of a failed investigation. We have had a detailed investigation, and now we have to act on its conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1134.1/2">Secondly, judge-led public inquiries take an incredibly long time to conclude. I shall set out my evidence. In the motion, the Opposition want an inquiry established under the Inquiries Act 2005. There have been 14 inquiries under that Act, seven of which are still ongoing or have not been published because of criminal proceedings&#8212;remember, as we hear, there could be criminal proceedings in this case&#8212;and one of which was set up seven years ago and still has not been published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.1/3">The shortest inquiry established at the outset under the Act&#8212;into the tragic loss of life following the explosion at the ICL Plastics factory in Glasgow&#8212;took one year and five months. No other inquiry established from the outset under the Act has taken less than two years. Frankly, the idea that a widespread judge-led public inquiry into the culture and professional standards in Britain&#8217;s largest industry would take place much quicker than a public inquiry into an explosion at a plastics factory in Glasgow is fanciful. It leads me to believe that the Labour party wants to put off the moment when we actually investigate what happened.</p>

The idea, then, that we could have a full public judge-led inquiry, while criminal prosecutions are taking place, and that it could conclude inside 12 months is completely fanciful&#8212;and the Labour party knows it.

That presents the House with a serious decision, because if we do not have the results of a broader inquiry, we will not be able to amend the banking Bill, when it is introduced into Parliament next January, in order to change the law and adopt the conclusions of the inquiry. We have one of two choices, then. We can either delay the inquiry&#8212;[Hon.

Because we are talking about an inquiry into the professional standards of the entire banking industry, which is a pretty big subject for an inquiry. Even if we assume that we could find a judge very quickly, that the inquiry was up and running at some point in the autumn, that took a year and a half&#8212;which is how long the inquiry in Glasgow took&#8212;and that the Government were allowed six to nine months to respond to the inquiry&#8217;s conclusions, have a White Paper and do the consultation required under Labour&#8217;s laws, that would make it impossible in this Parliament to make the changes to the law that might be required. This Parliament would be saying, &#8220;We are simply not able to change the law to deal with the scandal,&#8221; which would have happened almost a decade ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.1136.5/1">In quoting the proceedings of the Treasury Committee, the Chancellor failed to quote accurately. I happen to have the transcript of yesterday&#8217;s sitting here, and it is unambiguous. The</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/2">Tory vice-Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40524" name="Michael Fallon">the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon)</phrase>, asked Mr Diamond the final question on this point. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/3">&#8220;I understand all that, but the effect of what you have written down here is that Ministers or officials were in effect asking you to fiddle your submission.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/4">Mr Diamond replied, in his final comment on this point:</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/5">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe that, no.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/6">He also said something that is of even more significance than the Chancellor&#8217;s smears, when it comes to the decision that has to be made. Diamond confirmed what we knew already from what the Financial Services Authority had said: he said that other banks were involved. One bank that has had to sack people is the largely state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland&#8212;the one that the Chancellor is primarily responsible for via a Government agency. There is no question but that what went on in Barclays was going on in&#8212;it has been suggested&#8212;at least 20 other investment banks, including the one that the Chancellor is predominantly responsible for: the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/7">This scandal is therefore not restricted to Barclays. We know what a scandal Barclays is. I asked Mr Diamond 13 questions yesterday, and got no answers, other than his confirming that, as the man in charge of an investment bank, he asked no questions and carried out no analysis whatever of why the rates were different or whether there were any oddities in the rates that were being presented to the British Bankers Association by his bankers. He says he knew nothing, which is a little incongruous, but he did confirm that there were inter-bank issues here, as bankers from other banks were ringing Barclays and asking for favours&#8212;with the now infamous bottle of Bollinger being offered as a present in recompense.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/8">The Royal Bank of Scotland is the Chancellor&#8217;s responsibility. Unfortunately, he failed to take interventions, including from myself; if he had allowed me to intervene I would have asked him directly what questions he has been asking about what has been happening over the last few months with the fiddling of the LIBOR rate within RBS&#8212;the bank for which, I repeat, he is predominantly responsible. In particular, I would have asked what the FSA is now telling the Chancellor about its inquiries. That is important because it will impact hugely on the nature of the investigation to be carried out. To suggest, as did the Chancellor&#8212;and the Prime Minister previously alluded to it&#8212;that this investigation could be confined solely to Barclays bank is clearly nonsense. What we are going to see, which we have not yet seen, is what the FSA has to say about these other banks&#8212;up to 20 of them. We are also going to see what comes out in the United States over the next six months&#8212;precisely while the inquiry, whether judicial or parliamentary, is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/9">The only thing of which we can be certain is that this is a moving feast. That creates a major dilemma for us, whichever way we choose to go. A judicial inquiry cannot be limited to a short period of a few months and guaranteed. If it comes out that what happened at RBS is comparable to Barclays, that presents an even bigger issue for us and for the Government to address. RBS is a huge British bank&#8212;one that the taxpayer has had to</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/10">bail out and one largely owned by the taxpayer. The consequences for the Exchequer and the taxpayer will undoubtedly be even larger for RBS than for Barclays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/11">We do not know where the civil actions in the US are going to go or how quickly they will be carried out. That problem would afflict a judicial inquiry, however independent it was&#8212;and it would be independent&#8212;but it would afflict a parliamentary inquiry even more so. Who is going to sit on it, and for how long? That might sound like a small question to the outside world, but it is a major question. If the Chairman of the Treasury Committee or its members participate in the parliamentary inquiry, which would make some sense, it would effectively put the Treasury Committee out of action&#8212;perhaps for six months, but potentially for a year or 18 months&#8212;at a time when all these other major issues are before it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.5/12">That is the biggest reason why the joint inquiry will not work. It is simply not feasible for the Chair of the Treasury Committee to be effectively seconded for that period of time. However well resourced the Treasury Committee, its members will have to do two jobs simultaneously. The RBS question has not been answered in this context. I urge the House to consider it, because the issues are even bigger than for Barclays.</p>

	<p pid="a.1138.0/1">The rigging of the LIBOR market is shocking. It is the worst case of City malpractice I can recall. The Chancellor proposed the idea of a Joint Committee to me in several phone calls over the weekend. It was an honour to be considered. None the less, I made clear right from the start what ingredients I viewed as required to make a success of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/2">First, the Joint Committee&#8217;s terms of reference should be tightly drawn and forward looking. This cannot be a witch hunt. Having an exhaustive and inquisitorial committee of inquiry, whether it be within or outside Parliament, into the respective roles and responsibilities for mistakes of Ministers, civil servants, the Bank of England, regulators and commercial banks would do more for the history books than for the quality of legislation. The job of the Joint Committee must be to concentrate on how to get one part of the banking Bill into better shape, and in quick time. For that purpose it will need tightly drawn terms of reference, focused on improving standards and corporate governance in banking, and it can and should do the work quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/3">Secondly, as I said in that conversation, any committee of inquiry, particularly a parliamentary Committee, must have the support of the major parties across the House of Commons. It appears from what I am hearing here that it does not have that support at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139.1/1">I shall not address the second part of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question, but the first part was absolutely right. I think it essential for us to have cross-party support for any inquiry of whatever type.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.1/2">Let me now refer to a tiny bit of history. A hundred years ago, partisanship made a mockery of an attempt by a Select Committee to investigate the Marconi scandal. The Conservative Opposition killed any value that that inquiry might have supplied, and as a result Select Committees were written out of the piece for inquiries for nearly 100 years. I think it vital for Parliament that another clash of the Titans&#8212;which seems to be going on now&#8212;does not leave us in a position in which we, as Parliament, cannot subject this issue to an inquiry of any type.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139.2/1">May I raise the issue of the powers that a Select Committee has? One of the things that we have learnt from the Leveson inquiry and the whole phone hacking experience is that the powers of the House of Commons are very, very uncertain. We do not know whether, once we have taken evidence on oath, a perjury case can be brought against anyone who has lied to Parliament, or misled Parliament. We do not know whether we can force someone to come here. However, we do know that courts can do it, which is why we&#8212;why I&#8212;support a judge-led inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139.5/1">I will not, if my hon. Friend will forgive me. I am going to get on with my speech now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.5/2">The third point that I made to the Chancellor was that while the participation of some very experienced peers could add considerable value, any Committee should be Commons-led, should be governed by Commons rules of procedure, and should draw on existing membership of the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.5/3">The fourth point&#8212;which has been made again today&#8212;was that the Committee would need full technical support, not only from private sector expertise but from officials and the Bank of England, and some legal advice as well. The absence of all that is the main factor that would inhibit the Treasury Committee from doing this work at the speed that would be required to enable it to contribute to the banking Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.5/4">Public confidence in banking is now very low. That is bad for Britain in so many ways, but it is particularly unfair on the hundreds of thousands of hard-working</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.5/5">and trustworthy people in the financial services industry who do great work for this country, and who, having done nothing wrong, have found themselves impugned by implication. It is not realistic to expect that, in a few months, a Committee of this type would be able to draw the sting of the public anger about banking, but I do believe it realistic to hope that its recommendations could, once implemented, reduce the likelihood of such things happening again. The Wheatley review is due to report in about six weeks. We need to make sure that those perpetrating disgraceful practices such as the rigging of markets face stiff penalties, including jail. It is the fact that so many people have got off scot-free that really sticks in the gullet of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139.5/6">Over my time here I have done what I can to strengthen the role of Parliament. If colleagues across the House&#8212;and I mean right across the House, including the Front Benches&#8212;want me to do this work, I will do everything possible to make an inquiry of this type succeed in order to clear up this scandal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1140.0/1">The tone of this debate has been regrettable. It was, in effect, set by the article written in <i>The Spectator </i>by the Chancellor. It is clear that that article was written before Bob Diamond appeared before the Select Committee yesterday, so the evidence the Chancellor uses to back up what he says in it was given after it was published. He cannot produce any proof or evidence backing up the unfortunate accusation he has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.0/2">The Government must understand that the public are very angry about what banks have been getting up to, and they are not going to be satisfied if a Select Committee or a Joint Committee is set up to investigate the matter. That is just not going to get to the bottom of the issues that have made the public extremely angry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.0/3">Mr Diamond was deputy chief executive of corporate investment and banking until 2010, and he had been in that role for three years. That is the division of banking that deals with this area of investment. The idea that when he became the chief executive of Barclays he had no understanding of how LIBOR is set, the negotiations between banks and some of the sharp practices employed, and that he would remain completely ignorant of them, is beyond belief. In my opinion, it is clear that he attempted to cover up his knowledge of that when he appeared before the Select Committee yesterday. That just goes to show that there is a great deal of background that needs to be investigated. A Select Committee or Joint Committee would not be able to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.0/4">When hybrid Committees investigate a planning issue, it takes an enormous amount of effort and time to trawl through all the evidence and come to a balanced judgment. I have some knowledge of the Crossrail hybrid Committee, as that project affected my constituency. The Committee took up an enormous amount of its members&#8217; time and effort. In respect of this banking issue, in-depth investigations of the allegations and counter-allegations are required, and I am not sure whether a Committee of Members of this House, supported by House of Commons staff, will be able to undertake them with sufficient thoroughness to meet the level of public anger and concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141.3/1">My hon. Friend has made the point, and in the interests of brevity I will leave it there for the Government to comment on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/2">The Attorney-General is wrong to say that we cannot set up an inquiry such as the one the Opposition are calling for today while a criminal investigation is taking place. At least two criminal investigations are going on while the Leveson inquiry is taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/3">We have been here before. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-04">4 September 2010</phrase>, the<i> News of the World </i>issued the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/4">&#8220;We reject absolutely any suggestion there was a widespread culture of wrongdoing at the News of the World.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/5">We all know what that meant. The then editor of the<i> News of the </i> <i>World</i>, Colin Myler, told the Press Complaints Commission in August 2009 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/6">&#8220;Our internal inquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World staff other than Clive Goodman in phone-message interception&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/7">Let us compare that with Mr Diamond&#8217;s comment in his letter accepting the invitation to appear before the Treasury Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/8">&#8220;This inappropriate conduct was limited to a small number of people relative to the size of Barclays trading operations, and the authorities found no evidence that anyone more senior than the immediate desk supervisors was aware of the requests by traders, at the time that they were made.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/9">We heard exactly the same sort of defences being made against the Leveson inquiry being set up, suggesting that this was a small matter that needed to be investigated. This is too deep an issue to investigate through a Joint Committee of this House or a Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141.3/10">I am instinctively supportive of the idea that we should set up such Committees, but fundamental reform of this House of Commons would be required for us to carry out such an inquiry. Back Benchers would need to be able to conduct business independently of the Executive. We do not have the structures to deal with an issue such as this. We would also have to change the culture of this place. Back Benchers would have to have a duty to the public, rather than to our respective Front Benchers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142.0/2">Fundamental change in this House would be required of the type that simply has not taken place. It is such fundamental reform that we need, rather than the messing about that we have with the House of Lords, which will go absolutely nowhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.0/3">The inquiry that the Opposition are calling for today could establish what we need to do in order to legislate to clean up the setting of the LIBOR rate. That could be dealt with and expedited, but when it comes to the underlying issues and the people involved, we are talking about criminal activity. Let us remember that, at a time when taxpayers&#8217; money was being poured into the banking system to prop it up, these people were acting in their own personal interest and to profit Barclays and other banks, and against the interests of the country. In fact, it could even be called treason. These people belong behind bars, and the inquiry that needs to take place here&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Millionaires&#8217; row over there are giggling at that, but I can tell them that the public out there do not think it is funny. We need to have a proper investigation, independent of this House, that will satisfy the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142.1/1">I will start by declaring an interest. When I was the chairman of the Future of Banking Commission it was funded by the Consumer Association, which might have influenced my views on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.1/2">May I start by commending the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, for the tone of his speech? I agree that we should not let the smoke of political battle in this place come between us and rescuing one of the most important industries in the country. Members on both sides of the House should bear that point in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.1/3">The title of the debate and of both motions refers to the professional conduct of the business of banking. This is not just about LIBOR and the LIBOR scandal. If it stopped there, we could deal with it through two actions: a change to the procedure to make it transaction-based and audited, and the criminal prosecution of everybody involved. That would resolve the issue once and for all, but that is not as far as this goes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.1/4">We all know that the practice of banking in this country has become perverted by huge incentives, which have led bankers to behave in ways that do not serve the economic interests of the country or our national interests&#8212;indeed, they have had the opposite impact. Although the Chairman of the Select Committee rightly said that the inquiry would need to be tightly drawn, it will nevertheless go pretty far. I am quite certain, for example, that even if it is confined to banking, things such as the derivatives market will undergo a lot of investigation in the course of the Committee&#8217;s investigation. We must understand that this issue is much bigger than just LIBOR.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.1/5">Secondly, we should take on board the fact that we are debating the superstructure of the inquiry when we should perhaps be talking about its engine room. What matters are the inquiry&#8217;s powers, whichever we have, and they do not need to be so different for a judicial inquiry and for a Select Committee inquiry. I am afraid</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.1/6">that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40246" name="Clive Efford">the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> was just plumb wrong about the status of Select Committees in this House and their powers. I speak as a past Public Accounts Committee Chairman who summoned bankers, rail operators, pharmacy companies and all sorts of companies that did not want to come, to give their documents or to give evidence. We did not take evidence on oath, but they did not want to give evidence to the Committee and were made to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1143.0/1">I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman about the relative skills of a parliamentary inquiry and a judge-led inquiry.

	<p pid="a.1143.1/1">Absolutely. The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport and its inability to reach a unanimous view has been held up as an example. In my entire time as PAC Chairman&#8212;and, I think, that of all the subsequent Chairmen&#8212;there was never anything other than a unanimous outcome, because of the factual basis of the inquiries. That is what this inquiry must have. It must rest on the facts, which is why the Committee will need forensic accountants, lawyers and investigating teams. It will, I think, need one change in the law. It will need protection for whistleblowers, as we do not have that, but the same would be true of a judge-led inquiry. That would open the inquiry up to its full extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.1/2">Let me make one more point about judge-led inquiries&#8212;it goes back to the Leveson inquiry and is slightly embarrassing for those on my side of the House, but I shall make it anyway. Judge-led inquiries cannot work around a criminal investigation without paying attention to it, and that can cramp what they do. If Members did not see it, I recommend that they look back at the evidence given by Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, both of whom were facing potential criminal charges. Those were wholly useless days at the Leveson inquiry because the QC involved had to tiptoe around the issues. That might apply to almost every witness who appears before this inquiry, thanks to the issues facing it, so we must bear it in mind that we cannot solve that with a judge. We will solve it through a different mechanism that either approach would have to use and that, frankly, would be in camera hearings with those witnesses. Although the conclusion will have to be wide, open, wide ranging, honest and transparent, that might not be possible for the evidence-taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.1/3">Although a House inquiry will be faster than a judicial inquiry&#8212;there is no doubt about that, for the reasons the Chancellor has given&#8212;there is the simple problem that any inquiry will have trouble completing by Christmas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1144.0/1">We need an investigation into LIBOR&#8212;there is no question about that. We need it because of the result of the FSA investigation into Barclays. The final notice on Barclays makes gruesome reading: LIBOR rates were manipulated for three and a half years, for which Barclays has been given a large fine. That means that there will be questions to the tripartite regulatory framework, and to the British Bankers Association, which is responsible for collating and calculating LIBORs. There will be questions of competence, action, oversight and omission for the Financial Standards Authority, the Bank of England and the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/2">This is an historic issue. We are already changing much or most of that, with the prudential regulation authority coming into being; the financial conduct authority looking at the conduct of business; the recommendations of the Vickers commission being implemented; and the Basel III requirements being implemented to sit over what the banks do. The Chancellor has announced that the chief exec-designate of the FCA will be given responsibility for looking at the setting and management of LIBOR. We are looking at strengthening the Financial Services Bill and at criminal sanctions in relation to LIBOR, and we want to make recommendations quickly so that we can change, beef up and strengthen the as yet unseen banking reform Bill. That is all good stuff, but the problem&#8212;and it is a huge problem&#8212;is that our concerns are about more than simply technical changes, better supervision and the implementation of a criminal sanction regime in relation to LIBOR, however necessary those things are, and they are extremely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/3">Yesterday, we heard quite extraordinary testimony from Bob Diamond, the ex- chief exec of Barclays, who told us that although LIBORs had been rigged for three and half a years, no one above the pay grade of desk supervisor knew anything about it. That is almost impossible, but it points to the fact that this is more than simply a technical problem&#8212;there is a deeper cultural problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/4">The other problem is that this is not about Barclays at all. The media tell us that there may be 20 or more banks in the frame, even before we look at other financial institutions that may do similar things. This is a fast-moving story. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> spoke about derivatives: this is not really a LIBOR problem&#8212;it is a problem of derivative traders manipulating LIBOR. I am not sure, within the narrow remit of a Joint Committee, that we can do all the cultural stuff we need to do. It might also be the case&#8212;in fact, I am certain that it will be&#8212;that issues arise not necessarily about LIBOR or even related to it but, equally serious, as a result of investigations that are under way in other banks. We will of course want to deal with those issues in changes that we make, as they may have the same consequences in the real economy and cause the same deterioration of confidence in the banking industry as the LIBOR scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/5">Our political parties back the call for a judge-led inquiry. It is the right thing to do, because the issues are far wider and deeper than merely the technical ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/6">However&#8212;and I say this to my friends in the Labour party&#8212;if we fail to secure a judge-led inquiry we will not stand in the way of a joint parliamentary inquiry, because there is an absolute imperative to investigate LIBOR. Nevertheless&#8212;and I think that Labour Front Benchers were right on this&#8212;the calls for a wider inquiry into the culture that led to the problems at Barclays must be heard.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>, a fellow member of the Treasury Committee. I am particularly grateful for his last point. I believe that there is an honest disagreement on the best route, but that there is far more consensus than members of the public who watched the early part of this afternoon&#8217;s debate might be given to think. There is a consensus both in the House and across the country that the LIBOR fixing is a scandal, that banking has yet again let down the country and that Parliament must take appropriate action to remedy that. There is also a consensus that further questions must be answered and advice taken to ensure that we take the right steps to remedy the banking industry for the longer term. Today&#8217;s debate should be about how to achieve that, and none of our constituents will be grateful if the result is a partisan deadlock while the bankers escape scot-free once again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/2">What do we actually need to know? First, we need to know all the facts relating to the LIBOR scandal. Secondly, we need to know how that has affected our constituents, both individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and how they can be compensated. Thirdly, and to my mind most importantly, we need to know whether banking as it now exists in the United Kingdom is fit for purpose and has the right model to deliver what society requires of it. How best are we to deal with that?</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/3">On the first point, with regard to Barclays we have all the facts relating to LIBOR. The report is comprehensive, as most people who have read it would admit, and, along with the US Justice Department&#8217;s report, gives us the facts we need. There will be new facts to come when the FSA reports on other banks, an important matter to which I will return. The FSA report on Barclays shows two things: traders fiddled for their own gain before the crash; and Barclays as an institution low-balled after the crash in order to protect itself. Both behaviours are unethical, and when I asked Mr Diamond about that yesterday he said, &#8220;Yes, they are unethical.&#8221; As I understand it, arrests may have been made and further arrests can be anticipated, so the facts are clear. What we need to know now is what we should do about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/4">On the second point, which is about our constituents, the FSA has put forward a model for how it will redress the swap selling scandal, and it involves the financial services ombudsman. I suggest that that is a technical process that will be able to do the job, but that we should monitor it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/5">We come to the third and most important point: is banking delivering for society? What do we need from our banks, and not the investment banks, but those on</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/6">the high street? We need a payments system that works. The RBS outage showed us that that is not always obvious. We need to have a safe home for deposits. Most importantly, we need a source of prudential lending for businesses. It should be a low-risk, low-return operation. It is clear that retail and investment banks have, and should have, separate cultures, so it is clear in my mind that they should be separated. We have had the Vickers recommendations, which represent the ring fence. I was prepared to accept that and would like it to be revisited as part of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/7">There are a number of material points that we need to look at. I want to look at how best we can do that, because we need to get right the legislation when it goes through Parliament and the banking Bill that is to come. I happen to believe that a judge-led inquiry is not the best way to fulfil that objective, but I recognise fully that others take a different view. I believe that a parliamentary inquiry is up to the job, but only if the standard Committee procedure is improved. I believe that the Committee should have a QC, a legal team and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> suggested, forensic accountants. It should have the resources that the Chancellor has said he will put in so that the new bits of evidence can be properly assessed and the barrister can lead part of the questioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/8">If today&#8217;s debate, therefore, leads us simply to an entrenched partisan position, nobody wins and the bankers get away again. It is essential that at the end of today&#8217;s debate we support an inquiry, whether it be parliamentary or judicial.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/9">When some more facts come to light in respect of what the FSA is looking at, we may decide that a wider and deeper inquiry is needed. Let us cross that bridge when we come to it, but let us for now get on with the job of taking what we have and putting it into legislation, so that we end up delivering for our citizens banks that are fit for purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146.0/1">I strongly support the proposal for a judicial inquiry. I am sure that under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> a parliamentary inquiry will do its best, but I think that for the reasons that have been advanced today there is a need for a judicial inquiry, because as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> have said, this issue goes way beyond fiddling the LIBOR rate. This is a much bigger issue, and it is the bigger issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/2">Whether the inquiry is parliamentary or judicial, I have concerns about the continual emphasis on the need to do something about the culture and standards of banking, because it implies that if we change the people at the top of banking we will change the behaviour. Would that were the case. I do not believe that it is. There are of course many people who work in banks who do an excellent job. They work very hard, they do not get paid a great deal of money or share in massive bonuses, and they are as disgusted as we are by what has gone on, but even if the most pious, puritanical person is put in charge of a den of inequity, they will eventually be corrupted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/3">That is what happens when someone is put on a trading floor, and I speak as somebody who worked in a bank. Many years ago I worked for Coutts, when it did what traditional retail banks did&#8212;what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40138" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> described, and what the general public want. But if somebody is put on a trading floor and deals in obscure derivatives and other financial products, they will be either corrupted by what goes on, crushed by their peers or, if he or she is very brave, turned into a whistleblower.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/4">Of course, there is a culture in banking that needs to be looked at&#8212;the culture of remuneration and bonuses. However, it is not just banking that has a culture whereby somebody who is paid to do a job, such as a nurse, teacher or bank clerk, and then expects to get a massive great bonus for doing it, irrespective of whether they do it well or badly. This is far removed from the lives of the general public because of the amounts of money being talked about. Bob Diamond has earned &#163;100 million, and if he walks away the question is whether he will get &#163;20 million. Twenty million pounds is way beyond what the vast majority of our constituents can expect to earn in a lifetime, even if we add in their pension pots, so we are talking about a surreal world as far as the wider public are concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/5">To be fair to the Business Secretary, he has said that the problem can be addressed through shareholder power. That is na&#239;ve, however, because the biggest shareholders of public companies are the institutions&#8212;and many of the people in those institutions sit on other boards, so it all becomes an incestuous circle. Different remuneration committees can consist of the same people. It all comes down to, &#8220;I&#8217;ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/6">If the Government were serious about making radical changes to the culture that I have just referred to, they could do worse than limit the number of directorships of publicly quoted companies that any one person can have. They could also change the rules so that the remuneration committees of all publicly quoted companies had a majority of small shareholders. That would really send shock waves across the institutions, but not the shareholders, who would welcome the opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.0/7">Time is running out. We need to change not just the culture but the structure of banking. In 1986, the wild west came back&#8212;all the firewalls and protections put in place following the previous financial crisis in 1929 were swept away. We are all responsible in some part for that; we created the masters of the universe, who have not done us any favours. We have to go back to basics and reconstruct a banking system that is fit for purpose, serves the people and is not self-serving for a small minority.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40082" name="Roger Godsiff">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr Godsiff)</phrase> has underlined the importance of having a banking system that commands public confidence. I do not know how serious the LIBOR scandal is in relation to the ability of the banks to support jobs and growth, which we so desperately need at the moment, but it is clearly a mortal blow to the reputation of the City so we need to deal with it effectively and quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.0/2">I say to Front Benchers on both sides in this debate that this has not been the finest hour of the House of Commons. We have not seen the finest, highest and</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.0/3">most principled leadership from Front Benchers of either side. Many among the public will look at the debate and scoff at our self-importance and arrogance. The City itself will be in utter despair that Front Benchers should have chosen to use this opportunity to tear chunks out of each other instead of co-operating to find a solution on which they can agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.0/4">No solution will work unless there is consensus. I say that with a very heavy heart, having great respect for the prodigious abilities of both my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the shadow Chancellor, as well as for their public service in the House. But I really think that we have to do better. Anybody could have seen over the past few days that the debate would be a complete car crash, and so it has been. We must seek to extract something positive from it at the end of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> raised the tone of the debate in a laudable manner. He referred to the Marconi scandal of 1912; this is its 100th anniversary, and I will say a few words about it soon if I have time. The parallels are chilling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.0/6">First, I shall say a brief word about the powers of Select Committees. The shadow Chancellor is completely wrong&#8212;we have the powers. There is some doubt about the manner of their exercise and how we might deal with contempt, but there is no doubt that we have the powers. As Chairman of a Select Committee, I have exercised them. People are in fear of them. It does the House no service for the shadow Chancellor to go around saying that we do not have powers. That undermines the authority of the House and it is not in the interests of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148.1/1">Actually, it is the Liaison Committee on which I serve as a Select Committee Chairman. I am personally looking into the matter and will report to the Liaison Committee next week; that will be part of our report on the powers and effectiveness of Select Committees, which we hope to produce before the end of this term. It greatly ill serves the House to denigrate the powers of Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148.1/2">I am going to support the Government motion. I am not in favour of a judicial inquiry; I think it would be completely dotty to plunge us into such a lengthy procedure. However, I want to sound some warnings about the dangers that might befall a parliamentary Select Committee inquiry as proposed in the Government motion. We must be mindful, not least, that if Ministers or ex-Ministers were to be called to give evidence to try to sort out the absurd row that we have seen this afternoon, the Committee could not possibly function. Indeed, it could not possibly function if Opposition Front Benchers were determined to undermine its authority and operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148.1/3">It was highly irresponsible of the shadow Chancellor to fail to answer my question or that of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor about whether the Opposition will go on non-speaks if the motion is carried. I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>, who said that even if the Opposition lose the vote, Scottish National party Members will co-operate with the inquiry. How is the House meant to make a judgment</p>
	<p pid="a.1148.1/4">about whether to vote for the motion unless we have a clear view from the shadow Chancellor?</p>
	<p pid="a.1148.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester mentioned the Marconi scandal. That occurred when Ministers&#8212;Liberal Democrat Ministers, I hasten to add, just for fun&#8212;were accused of buying and selling shares for profit&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.1149.1/1">I beg my hon. Friend&#8217;s pardon. Of course&#8212;rebranded to cleanse the history.</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/2">Lloyd George&#8217;s Government were deeply embroiled in what we would call an insider dealing scandal. A Select Committee was very contentiously set up. It divided on party lines, it divided on whether to call Ministers as witnesses, it divided into party groups during the questioning of witnesses, and it divided along party lines in the writing of the report. In fact, it produced three reports&#8212;the official report, the Chairman&#8217;s report, and a minority report. Interestingly, the introduction to the 23rd edition of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/3">&#8220;Such highly visible failure condemned their successors&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/4">Select Committees&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/5">&#8220;to a very limited role for almost half a century.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/6">I place great faith in my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester that he will draw stumps on the exercise if there is any danger that the Joint Committee is going to collapse in such a welter of recrimination. First, it could not produce a decent report under such circumstances; and secondly, it would damage this House in a very serious manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/7">I do not wish to give succour to Her Majesty&#8217;s Official Opposition, but I note that the consequence of the Marconi scandal was the passing of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 when, following a subsequent scandal that engulfed the Government, it was decided that there had to be an alternative means of conducting a judicial inquiry outside Parliament with a judge, and that is how that format came into being.</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/8">The report by the Salmon royal commission on tribunals and inquiries, which was produced in the 1960s and is still the bible of how tribunals and inquiries are conducted, said that it would be &#8220;a retrograde step&#8221; to resurrect the format of a judicial inquiry within Parliament. Among the drawbacks listed by Lord Salmon were that Committees were composed of Members representing the relative strength of parties in the House, that parliamentary Committees do not hear counsel&#8212;something that has been suggested today&#8212;that some of, if not all, their members will have no experience of taking evidence or cross-examining witnesses, and that witnesses might not enjoy the same absolute privilege as in a tribunal set up under the Act. Those are the dangers that we have to guard against when we vote for the motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/9">As I say, I am going to support the motion, but I add one other caveat. I would be grateful if the Minister will confirm that the Government will not present any objection to providing the resources&#8212;the money&#8212;that the Joint Committee will need to carry out its functions. We cannot have this new Committee raiding the staff and resources of other Committees. I think that if the inquiry</p>
	<p pid="a.1149.1/10">is confined to matters of policy and recommendations for legislation rather than trying to settle the internecine disputes that we have seen on the Floor of the House this afternoon, then it can function with the support of the Opposition, but if the Government want it to happen it must have the necessary resources, which may be substantial. I would also recommend recalling a senior Clerk who has recently retired instead of raiding a Clerk from another Committee, because otherwise all our work will be disrupted.</p>

	<p pid="a.1150.0/1">The sole argument advanced today by the Chancellor as to why there should not be a thorough, comprehensive, judge-led inquiry is that it would not report quickly enough. Despite the enormous bluster and noise of this debate&#8212;I very much agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> about that&#8212;that argument has been overturned by the Leader of the Opposition&#8217;s proposal for a two-tier inquiry, with the section on LIBOR to report by the end of December and the second part, which is the more important part, to report within 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.0/2">We have to answer the question that has not been answered: why are the Government so coy about a genuinely independent inquiry? Is it because of their fears over what a Leveson-style inquiry into banking might expose? After all, the City, which is a pretty hard-nosed institution, does not give half its total income to the Tory party year after year for nothing. It expects, and undoubtedly gets, a great deal in return. Is that why the scams that repeatedly tumble out of the City under the false pretence of financial innovation, such as the mis-selling of private pensions in the 1970s, which has not yet been mentioned, and the recent mis-selling of payment protection insurance and credit default swaps, have always been treated so lightly?</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.0/3">Is that why the Vickers recommendations, which were already weak since the City will always get around Chinese walls by regulatory arbitrage, have been watered down further through the lobbying of the banks? The crucial rise in capital ratios was initially set at 4%, which is certainly the minimum that is necessary. That was reduced by the Chancellor to 3% and even that feeble reform has been postponed, almost unbelievably, until 2019.</p>

	<p pid="a.1150.1/1">I appreciated the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s support for my efforts in January to secure a Back-Bench debate on criminal prosecutions in financial services. He asked why Government Members want a parliamentary inquiry. Does he not accept that our constituents have a visceral attitude towards the misdeeds in the financial services sector, and that one problem with a judicial inquiry is that it is the equivalent of a snooze button and the people disengage? A parliamentary inquiry would not suffer that fate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1150.2/1">I think the exact opposite is true. The Leveson inquiry has aroused and maintained intense public interest. Yesterday&#8217;s Treasury Committee sitting showed what happens on such occasions. Unfortunately, it became very personalised about what each Member had been saying and drew attention to the degree to which Bob Diamond was not put under serious threat. There are therefore very good reasons for a judge-led inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.2/2">Is the close political-financial nexus that exists in this country the reason why the demands of Germany and France for a financial transactions tax have been swept so cavalierly under the carpet by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? Is that why the pressure from Germany and the US to wind down the egregious tax avoidance that is largely centred on Britain&#8217;s Crown dependencies has been flatly rejected by the Government at the behest of the City?</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.2/3">Why are the complex derivatives that lay at the heart of the crash in 2008-09 being retained by the Government within the ring fence? Why has the incestuous relationship between the credit rating agencies and those whose creditworthiness they are supposed to be assessing been left untouched by the Government, when it allowed junk derivatives to be sold around the world with a triple A rating? What is the answer to all these questions? I think that they are very significant. Why has the colossal scandal of tax avoidance on the industrial scale of &#163;42 billion a year, in which the City is so intimately involved, been ignored so unscrupulously?</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.2/4">I shall give an example. The Government set up the Aaronson group to consider the issue, led by a lawyer who has always represented the tax avoidance industry and never Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. On the first page of its report last November, that group said that a general anti-avoidance rule was not necessary. It produced the preposterous proposal that if there were such a rule, HMRC would have to seek the permission of an external body before it could be used. It gets worse, because there would have to be a majority of tax avoidance industry representatives on that body. Not surprisingly, the Government have accepted those recommendations in full. That shows the inordinate lengths to which they will go to protect the City by appearing to do something but in reality elaborately constructing a paper aeroplane in the sure knowledge that it will not fly. Those are just some of the reasons, and I believe a lot more remain hidden, why the Government do not want a judge-led inquiry at any price. They are exactly the same reasons why a systematic, wide-ranging inquiry is now so necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.2/5">I agree with many Members that in the last analysis, this is not about personalities or even about the corrupted culture of banking. It is much more about the deeply flawed structure and role of banking in Britain. The banks are far too big, and the big five control up to 90% of the money supply, which is far too much. We need smaller, more specialised banks that focus on key areas such as infrastructure, relational banking like that in the German mittelstand, the knowledge, science and research and development industries, the green economy, small and medium-sized enterprises and all the rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.2/6">Above all, we need to regain public control of the money supply, which was privatised as a result of deregulation in the 1990s, so that&#8212;this is the crucial point&#8212;the nation&#8217;s financial resources are focused not on the banks&#8217; interests of profiteering from overseas speculation, tax havens and property, in which they specialise most of all, but on the national interest of putting the nation&#8217;s resources primarily into industry, manufacturing and export. That is why the whole House should unite behind the Opposition&#8217;s motion.</p>

He said to us that what the bank had that mattered most was its reputation, that capital would always flow to good ideas and that if we did not have great amounts of capital, that was not a problem because we had our client relationships. He said that we must always remember to put our clients&#8217; interests first, never our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/2">My first boss was George Magnus, the chief economist at Warburg&#8217;s, who is still active. I remember him saying to me that we should never talk our book, and that we were there to be objective. He said that we should never be particularly proud if we got something right or concerned if we got something wrong, but that we should be proud of the integrity of our way of thinking. When I was given a bonus, I expressed gratitude. The culture had not yet become that we should look upset in the hope of more next time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/3">Only when I went to do an MBA at Columbia university in New York did I realise that the fact that I had become a rated analyst was of personal value to me and that I could perhaps have gone to another bank and got more money. When I came back from America, the position here had changed. We had the regulatory system of the FSA, and I was more involved in advising retail banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/4">One case that I worked on for a substantial time was that of a retail bank merging with an insurance firm. It was clear to me that to treat customers fairly in merging the compliance function, as I was tasked to do, we had to focus on how that insurer might sell products to the bank&#8217;s customers. There was nothing wrong with that per se&#8212;that, along with stripping out cost, was the rationale for the merger&#8212;but it clearly brought risks, and we needed a function that would stop inappropriate sales to customers for whom they were not correct. Yet the main issues in dealing with the FSA were a turf war between the bank and the insurance regulator and a vast amount of time spent on box-ticking compliance. The question is not just whether the system is over-regulated or under-regulated, it is about the quality of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/5">I then became a lawyer&#8212;I am both a qualified barrister and a solicitor&#8212;when I worked on bank recapitalisations and FSA litigation. I served as a judicial assistant to the vice-president of the Court of Appeal. The motion asks for a judge-led inquiry. I have enormous respect for our senior judiciary, but they have almost entirely been judges and lawyers&#8212;they have not worked in financial services industries and are not, as hon. Members are, representative of wider society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/6">On LIBOR, two separate things happened with Barclays. First, there was market abuse&#8212;we will see what happens in respect of other banks. Because the two mid-quartiles of LIBOR were measured, it was thought there could be no gain by giving a low or high response, but there was collusion by so many players that there was market abuse, and the FSA was asleep on the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/7">I would encourage hon. Members to think about the second Barclays aspect in terms of the perspective of the time. The British Bankers Association says that LIBOR</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/8">&#8220;is not necessarily based on actual transactions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/9">Banks are asked a question:</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/10">&#8220;At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/11">We should note that the question refers to &#8220;offers&#8221; rather than &#8220;an offer&#8221;, but the BBA goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/12">&#8220;Therefore, submissions are based upon the lowest perceived rate at which a bank could&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/13">borrow. It also says that &#8220;reasonable market size&#8221; is not defined and that</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/14">&#8220;it would have to be constantly monitored and in the current conditions would have to be changed very frequently.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/15">Whitehall was therefore using Barclays reports for a purpose for which they were not designed. It was looking not at LIBOR, but at one particular bank&#8217;s reports, which were quite possibly compiled by a junior person, in an incredibly difficult market position. Therefore, if Barclays reported a higher rate than other banks, it might be that it had different perceptions of &#8220;reasonable market size&#8221;, or it might not ask the offered rates because the market had frozen. Which banks were asked and how are those considerations to be reported? The banks are not being asked: &#8220;What are your bid and offer rates?&#8221; They are being asked: &#8220;What do you perceive one of your competitors might offer you were you to ask?&#8221; In the context of the financial crisis, that is potentially different from the market abuse I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.0/16">We should also consider the UK in the international context. We have a huge banking industry in this country. If a regulator says that much of it is socially useless, people might reply, &#8220;Yes, but the employment and prosperity of many people in the country depend on it.&#8221; How do we clear it up so we can offer a market and export our financial services to the world sustainably and in a way that will keep our reputation? Hon. Members can rail and bash the bankers for the bust we are suffering&#8212;that is quite fair and proper&#8212;but we must accept that the bankers also gave us our boom. Our borrowing and extra spending was based on candyfloss, and on a boom that the bankers created. They are as responsible for what we enjoyed in the boom as they are for the bust.</p>

	<p pid="a.1153.0/1">Is my hon. Friend saying that wrong regulation rather than under-regulation robs the system of discipline, and that we want a more capitalist, self-disciplined system rather than more bad regulation?</p>

	<p pid="a.1153.1/1">Elements of such regulation have been backed, but we must look at the quality of regulation. We can have a market system in which people are clear what the regulation is, or a system in which the Government runs regulation and bails everyone out, making the taxpayer responsible. We were betwixt those two separate models. Some parts of the market but not others were regulated, and people put stress and reliance on LIBOR that it was never designed for, which led to much of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.1/2">We cannot take what the regulators say as Gospel. Many say that Barclays accepted that the Bank of England and Paul Tucker had not told it to lower the rate. Barclays was let off tens of millions in fines because the regulators agreed that, but the regulators have a vested interest&#8212;people might ask why they were</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.1/3">asleep on the job in the earlier phase, and what LIBOR was doing in 2008-09. Hon. Members should consider what reliance Ministers or officials at that time put on LIBOR&#8212;we should ask what LIBOR said about Barclays, why the Government were trying to push Barclays into a bail-out it was trying to resist, and why there was such reliance on that rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1154.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a very interesting speech. Is he saying that because it was widely known that the Government were prepared to rescue the banks, the self-discipline that liability for bankruptcy provides in a banking system was abandoned and the whole market was distorted?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-05a.1154.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40502" speakername="Mark Reckless" colnum="1154"  time="016:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120705/debtext/120705-0003.htm#12070562002877">
	<p pid="a.1154.1/1">For the calculation of LIBOR, I wonder whether it had been abandoned for RBS and Lloyds HBOS&#8212;as it became&#8212;while Barclays continued operating in a market context. The BBA now says that banks have to quote on the basis of an unsecured, unregulated, non-Government-supported rate, but I do not know whether that was the definition it gave at the time. That would have been a concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.1/2">In conclusion, Members of Parliament, representing their constituents, have the necessary range of experience to have a reckoning, as a society and a nation, with what has happened with our banks, to assess the costs, as well as the benefits that we enjoyed, and to consider how to move on and put the matter behind us. I know, from my experience on the Home Affairs Committee, that we can have a non-partisan Committee that can reach across. We have people with the necessary experience and independence of mind. We can get together a group of people to come up with a report that downplays partisanship, to find out what went wrong and to learn the lessons for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1154.2/1">It is good that the debate has come to a calmer and more sensible level. The start demonstrated exactly why the House is incapable of conducting an impartial inquiry. With that degree of partiality and the petty debating points made by the Chancellor, it would be impossible to conduct a serious inquiry into banking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/2">Let us remember that we are talking not about who said what to whom in 2008, but about the professional standards of bankers. The Government have made a big mistake in trying to shift the blame for the LIBOR manipulation on to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> and the previous Labour Government. It is inconceivable that a system of manipulation that lasted five years and which Bob Diamond&#8212;the man paid &#163;20 million a year to know what was happening in his company&#8212;did not know about could have been caused by a word on the telephone from my right hon. Friend, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase> or anybody else.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/3">We have so far been silent on the real cause of these difficulties and manipulations. I refer to the problem of deregulation, which has made all this possible. The deregulation here&#8212;the big bang&#8212;was followed in the United States by the repeal of Glass-Steagall under Bill Clinton. That was the 1937 legislation that wisely enforced the separation of the utility, trading arms and the</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/4">merchant-banking, casino-gambling arms of the banks. It made distinct entities of them. After its repeal, banks here and there began to come together, with the trading arms subordinated to the gambling-casino, merchant-banking activities, and that set the tone and the ethics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/5">The result was the end of the old neighbourhood banking system of friendly bank managers in cupboards advising us on what to do with our money and providing money for mortgages and small businesses. All that went, and we had the spectacle of the kind of gambling made possible by all these inventive processes, such as the slicing and dicing, and parcelling out of debt, securitisation, derivative gambling&#8212;a form of gambling without gambling tax&#8212;sub-prime mortgages and now LIBOR manipulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/6">All those practices were made possible by the new ethics of the merchant banks. A new greed entered banking, and the only ethic at the top was greed. If people such as merchant bankers have too much power, it follows that they will abuse it. It follows that if they have too much power, they have to be regulated. It was the repeal of regulation and the passion of both parties&#8212;the Tories were more passionately anti-regulation than we were, but we still deregulated too much&#8212;that created the opportunity for this to break out into the mess that it did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/7">We have had a whole series of manipulations. I came across another one in 1992, when a young American trader with American Express bank came to me and said that points were being skimmed off foreign exchange transactions. Points that should have gone to the owner of the fund&#8212;the customer&#8212;were being taken by the dealers for themselves. We are talking about only a couple of points&#8212;one or two points&#8212;but added up over a long period, it came to huge sums of money, given the enormous numbers of transfers being made. Everybody pooh-poohed it. I took that trader to Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, who told him, &#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t happen here. We&#8217;ve inspected the bank. Nothing like this is going on,&#8221; but it just was not true. It was going on, and now in America there is a lawsuit against New York Mellon bank for &#163;2 billion that was skimmed off by traders in foreign exchange transactions. If that is going on in the States, it is going on here, and the only way to deal with it is through quite simple regulation to require time-stamping of all trading transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/8">Similarly, the ethics of the banks can be dealt with more effectively not, as Vickers puts it, by ring-fencing their two functions, but by driving them apart totally. That way, the neighbourhood banks&#8212;the local banks, the trading banks&#8212;can return to their old priority of serving the customer, the locality and local businesses, providing money for them and their transactions, while the merchant banking can continue its gambling elsewhere, I hope in a way that is more restricted by legislation and less prone to simple cheating. That is the only way to deal with these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/9">In conclusion, we have heard a lot of arguments about whether we should have a judge-led inquiry or a parliamentary inquiry. A parliamentary inquiry would be nice&#8212;it would allow us to play Perry Mason for a while and get a few headlines&#8212;but ultimately people will not have faith in it, because the Government have a majority and we have seen how they would react to the situation already. There is therefore no point in setting</p>
	<p pid="a.1154.2/10">up an inquiry that people will not have faith in. We need a full and fair inquiry&#8212;a judge-led inquiry&#8212;to know what is going on and to tell the people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156.0/1">Many good and relevant points have been made from the Government Benches already, so I want to make just three brief points.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.0/2">In any debate on the banking sector, it is vital to remember the importance of financial services to the UK economy. I say that as someone who represents a constituency in Essex. Thousands of my constituents work in the City of London, and I can assure the House that they are not criminals. They are not the type of bankers who should be vilified; they are, of course, hard-working, law-abiding, tax-paying individuals, who help to contribute to that &#163;100 billion to the UK economy and that &#163;63 billion in taxes to the Exchequer. We should remember that we are world leaders in financial services, and it is wrong to vilify the entire sector for the sins of the few. It is because the overwhelming majority of City workers, including those from Essex, take such great pride in their work that the scandals currently rocking the financial sector are so damaging, not just to them and their jobs, but to the reputation of UK plc and our financial services sector full stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.0/3">That is why it is important for us all to consider seriously the professional standards of the financial sector and the banking industry in a sober and considered way in this House. Today&#8217;s debate has been incredibly lively, as well as quite partisan, but I would like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, the Chair of the Treasury Committee, for bringing sanity back to the debate. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> said, although many issues need to be addressed right now, we have to look at the role of Parliament, the role of Select Committees and the ability of parliamentarians to scrutinise these issues in the right and proper way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.0/4">I think we would all agree that any criminality or wrongdoing that has hampered the fair functioning of the financial markets thus far must be fully investigated. Those who are found guilty should face stern punishment. In my view, there should be an unprecedented crackdown on those who lied and cheated, but we should not be demonising everybody in the City. It is our job as legislators to review what has gone wrong, to examine the wrongdoing, and, where possible, to legislate to reduce the prospect of serious misdeeds ever happening again. That is why a parliamentary inquiry led by a Joint Committee of both Houses is the most appropriate way to proceed. We have heard arguments in favour of that option today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.0/5">We have also heard about the abilities of parliamentarians. We have been elected to this House not only because of our backgrounds and our judgments. We have been elected to bring our experience to the fore, to articulate and to challenge, to be advocates and to be significant interrogators. We have heard evidence of hubris today, but it is important that we get on with the job. We need to find out why the regulatory system is broken. Vested interests have been mentioned on a number of occasions. We now need to get on with the job and fix this in the shortest possible time frame.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.0/6">Nobody should be playing at party politics now. If we do that, it will take longer to clean up the City and even longer to bring in new regulations and laws. On that basis, I welcome the inquiry. It is incumbent on us all to get on and repair the damage that was done in the past by all those who have been involved in bad legislation and bad regulation. We need to restore the reputation of our financial services sector.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-05a.1157.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" speakername="Russell Brown" colnum="1157"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120705/debtext/120705-0003.htm#12070562002880">
	<p pid="a.1157.0/1">I suspect that we are concentrating on how we can improve the system for businesses, rather than for the banks. I want to concentrate on some of the activity that has been drawn to my attention by my constituents. Small businesses are hurting at the moment, and some of them are reluctant to come forward because they are embarrassed at finding themselves in such a fiasco. Those people are running businesses that are in severe financial difficulties because of the activities of the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/2">To a certain extent, I agree with the Chair of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, and others who said that the vast majority of people who work in the finance and banking sector are decent, hard-working people. Many are not on particularly large incomes. Talk of the bonus culture tends to concentrate on the Bob Diamonds of this world, but many of those people on low incomes depend on their bonuses to get by. There is no doubt, however, that the business is full of wide boys and spivs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/3">I have seen e-mails spanning a period of time involving a company called Guardian Care Homes. That company has been successful in some of its prosecutions. For Bob Diamond to say that he did not really know what was going on in his organisation is complete and utter nonsense. For two months, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> trailed the activities involving Guardian Care Homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/4">I also want to mention an issue that was drawn to my attention some 18 months ago. I spoke to the Chairman of the Select Committee&#8212;I am sorry that he is no longer in his place&#8212;one evening after a Division, and expressed my serious concern to him about the sale of hedges and swaps. According to my inquiries, Barclays appears, a number of years ago, to have set up a specific section to target and home in on leisure facilities, caravan sites and the like. In July 2005, one of my constituents was approached by Barclays and asked whether he would go back to banking with it. He was offered a loan, as well as two swaps to protect him against fluctuations in interest rates. Over a short period of time, the value of his assets climbed. The bank then approached him and asked him to consider some of its hedges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/5">I want to thank the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40256" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr Hoban)</phrase>, who is in his place, for providing some of the FSA&#8217;s findings on these matters over the past couple of days. The manner in which some of these banks have been operating is absolutely unbelievable. If I could not see it in writing myself or hear what constituents were saying, I would not have believed it, as there has been 100% hedging of some of the loans offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/6">This time last week, I met another constituent who also operates in the leisure and caravan sector. He is a partner in two small businesses, running two caravan sites in my constituency and two in a neighbouring constituency. His bank&#8212;not Barclays bank, incidentally&#8212;pulled him in and encouraged him to have a look at another three caravan sites that were on the market. The guy was not that keen, but he went away and considered the proposal, and came back to the bank to say, &#8220;Yes, I might be interested in a loan&#8221;. He was offered the loan, but only on the basis that he took out more swaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/7">That sort of activity has been going on, but I really do not know how many people out there have been caught up in it. It is interesting to note that the Financial Services Authority&#8217;s letter to Financial Secretary says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/8">&#8220;During the period 2001 to date, banks sold around 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.0/9">What does that mean? How big is the scale of this? That is particularly important if compensation has to be paid? There is a serious concern that if compensation is paid, it could bring banks down. When it comes to protection, people are looking for answers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158.1/1">Let me tackle that quickly. Yes, during the last couple of days, I have received more than 30 e-mails from constituents, saying that they want a proper inquiry. Here we are in this Chamber, but we all have to stand outwith it. What will people have witnessed here this afternoon? Partisanship. I understand that we can all get dragged into it, but I have to say that people have no faith in this place. On both sides of this House, we see ex-bankers and ex-financial advisers. Quite honestly, Madam Deputy Speaker, if you were to ask me, &#8220;Would you trust these people?&#8221;, my answer would have to be no. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If we seek a genuine answer, this problem needs to be tackled by being placed in the hands of someone else. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Conservative Members should calm down.

Can he think of a better way of getting into a position to action that than setting up a Joint Committee that can identify the requisite amendments and get them ready for January? That seems to me to be the point the hon. Gentleman is making.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158.3/1">The point I am making is that the people of this country will have faith only if this matter is dealt with in a truly independent manner. That means it needs to be done through a judicial system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158.3/2">The local business man who initially approached me had four businesses operating in four different parts of the country. The bank put so much of a squeeze on him as he chopped and changed these swaps and hedges that it ended up forcing this guy to sell three of his businesses, one after another, to repay it. I highlight to the Government Front-Bench team that the bank has now moved in administrators on the basis that the man owes it &#163;1.4 million. That debt includes a charge of &#163;900,000 as a break fee or cancellation for those swaps and hedges. That is a phenomenal charge; it is just breathtaking. There has now been an admission of mis-selling. I have tried to contact the administrators to say, &#8220;Back off, you&#8217;re taking this business down&#8221;, and I wonder how many others out there are in a similar position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158.3/3">I say to Ministers that it is important for us to put the system right, as a House, as an Opposition and as a Government. We need to stamp on banks now to get them to stop some of the activity in which they are engaged. They are taking businesses to the wall, administrators are running rife, and we sit back and just allow it to happen. That is not acceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1159.2/1">Many years ago, when I was at business school with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, I took a summer job in Wall street. I shall never forget the occasion on which I was interviewed by a certain individual who sat with his feet up on his desk, wearing big red braces, smoking a huge cigar, and chewing gum. The interview was for a job in leveraged buy-outs. Before even introducing himself, that individual said to me, &#8220;David, how greedy are you?&#8221; I do not remember what my response was, but in my head it was pretty clear: &#8220;Not greedy enough to take this job.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1159.2/2">My interest in investment banking evaporated pretty quickly after that experience of outrageous behaviour and outrageous remarks. Behaviour of that kind on the part of a few bankers has led to investment banking in particular, but banking across the board to some extent, being given a very bad review by many of our constituents, and it has failed to build the trust that is so badly needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159.2/3">I went on to spend most of my career in retail, much of it at Asda, building its financial services business. There was a stark difference between supermarkets and banks when it came to levels of trust&#8212;and that was back in 2002; I hate to think what the difference is nowadays. Every day the supermarkets had to go out and compete for the right to earn the trust and loyalty of their customers, so that they would shop there every week. The lifetime value of those shopping baskets was vital. The supermarkets knew that if they captured that loyalty, it would lead to profits on the bottom line. In banking, by contrast, the focus is so much on short-term profit that the banks lose sight of the customer side of the equation. That was brought home to me starkly when I spent a couple of years working for Barclays before the election, trying to address some of the effects of the credit crunch on its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159.2/4">My work in retail financial services highlighted the need for change, and also how difficult it is to bring it about: to break with accepted norms, and to move on from rules of the game that people have previously regarded as being quite acceptable. The LIBOR-fixing scandal has highlighted the desperate need for root-and-branch change in investment banking. That change is needed, and it is needed sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159.2/5">It is hard to believe that it is five years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and five years since we saw the queues outside Northern Rock. The public expect change, and they expect it quickly. It is for that reason&#8212;the need for urgent action&#8212;that I support the call for a parliamentary inquiry. We cannot wait until 2015 or 2016 to secure the answers and, more important, the solutions. A properly resourced parliamentary inquiry with full access to papers, officials and Ministers, with evidence given under oath, could make much-needed progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.1160.5/1">Today&#8217;s debate&#8212;especially the beginning of it&#8212;makes the case more eloquently than I ever could for a forensic, judge-led inquiry, free from charges of partisan political game-playing of the type in which the Prime Minister and, even more disgracefully, the Chancellor have engaged since last Monday. Anyone genuinely wishing for cross-party agreement on the approach to be taken in an inquiry into this incredibly important industry would not have conducted themselves as they have since last Monday. However, since then we have had a more nuanced and calm debate, which I was not expecting after the beginning we had. I am glad that temperatures have cooled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.5/2">As I said last week when news of the LIBOR fixing scandal first broke, the potentially criminal behaviour that has been uncovered at Barclays is truly shocking. We also know that other banks are certainly involved, and that investigations are currently being conducted by regulators across three continents. This should not be an occasion for petty party-political points scoring, therefore; it should be a matter of the utmost concern on both sides of the House. Our constituents want us to concentrate on getting to the bottom of this and putting it right, and that is what this debate should be about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.5/3">Today, we have a choice between a Government motion proposing a tightly drawn, limited parliamentary inquiry and a motion, supported by all the Opposition parties, proposing an independent, forensic, two-part, judge-led inquiry, with the first part reporting by the end of 2012 on the scandal surrounding LIBOR, and the second part reporting within a year, looking at the wider issues of culture and practices in the banking industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.5/4">The House must today consider whether the scale of misconduct in the banking industry justifies a judicial inquiry, rather than a quick parliamentary examination. In deciding which approach is more appropriate, we need to consider the following questions. Are there issues of culture and practices across the industry that need to be forensically examined? Does the scale of misconduct in the banking industry threaten the future prosperity of the UK if problems are brushed under the carpet and the situation quickly returns to business as usual? Is the culture of multi-million pound bonuses for bankers as a reward for high-risk, complex trading&#8212;a culture that took root in the 1980s&#8212;something we should worry about? A moment&#8217;s consideration reveals that the answer to all those questions is yes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1161.3/1">With expert advice, certainly. That is therefore the approach we must choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.3/2">The banking industry does not want a judicial inquiry; it wants&#8212;a multi-billion pound&#8212;business as usual. We saw that in its response to the Vickers commission on reform. Top banking executives lobbied hard to protect the status quo, and the Chancellor caved in, but the British people want a judicial inquiry, because they are sick to death of bankers taking mega-bonuses while refusing to lend to small business&#8212;we have heard about some instances of that&#8212;or to support struggling households. They are angry that greed and irresponsibility in the banking sector led to the credit crunch and they are angry about the real suffering it has inflicted. They want change, not the status quo. They do not want business as usual.</p>

	<p pid="a.1162.1/1">The public demand action that will be effective, and that is calm and considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/2">A year ago, this House had to decide the best way to get to the bottom of practices in the media. The House made the right choice then. It decided that a judicial inquiry was the best way to get to the truth, to get to the bottom of what had gone on, and to produce recommendations on how culture and practices could be improved. In that instance, the Prime Minister said that the best way of getting to the truth was</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/3">&#8220;a judge-led inquiry with Ministers answering questions under oath where all the documents have to be revealed and the whole thing is pursued properly by a team of barristers who are expert at finding out the facts&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-04-30.1251"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 April 2012; Vol. 543, c. 1251</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/4">I am frankly baffled about why the Prime Minister thinks that the best way to get to the bottom of what went on at News International is a judicial inquiry, but the best way to get at what has happened in banking is anything but. It is the wrong choice. Why is the Prime Minister doing what the banking industry, rather than the country, wants him to do?</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/5">Let us consider the two options before us today: a parliamentary inquiry or a judge-led inquiry. The Inquiries Act 2005 requires the panel to be independent. This is especially important when there are allegations of the involvement of Whitehall and the Bank of England. The Act ensures transparency and guarantees due legal process. Its enforcement powers are clear and set out in statute, and it can draw upon expert skills and resources to complete its task.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/6">In its 2004-05 report, the Public Administration Committee observed that Committees are not ideally suited to conducting specialised investigations into particular events because of perceptions of partisanship&#8212;we have had a little bit of that today&#8212;and the limits of ongoing co-operation which could reasonably be expected from Government, and because their evidence-taking procedures are not well suited to drawing out the truth from witnesses. I agree with that assessment. Because of the extraordinary tone adopted by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, this inquiry has already been poisoned by political partisanship&#8212;a point recognised, to his credit, by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/7">A parliamentary inquiry would be dependent on support from Treasury officials who are answerable to obviously partisan Ministers. The rules for parliamentary Committees are in a state of flux; they are obscure and potentially difficult to enforce. A judicial inquiry, as the Prime Minister has said, would have a team of barristers and experts in their field to get at the truth. It is for those reasons that the House rightly chose to set up the Leveson inquiry. Although the Culture, Media and Sport Committee did a good job in examining conduct at News International, it had some obvious limitations. First, the Committee&#8217;s powers were insufficient to get at the truth, a matter that is currently being considered by the Standards and Privileges Committee. Secondly, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was unable to</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/8">agree a unanimous report and split on party lines, diluting its effect. A judicial inquiry would command widespread public support because of the requirement on those involved to act in a non-partisan way. This House made the right choice in opting for a forensic, judge-led inquiry. It should do so again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162.1/9">The Prime Minister has made the wrong choice. The Government first opposed holding any inquiry at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163.1/1">No, because there is only a minute left.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.1/2">With no consultation with Opposition parties, the Prime Minister announced a tightly drawn parliamentary inquiry. He first opposed a parliamentary vote, only then to give way. Over the last three days, on every day, at every stage, the Prime Minister has made the wrong choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.1/3">This inquiry will have a Government majority, so far as we can see, because the Prime Minister&#8217;s guiding principle has been partisan interest, not the national interest. From day one, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and their parliamentary outriders&#8212;we have heard from some of them today&#8212;have smeared their way around this issue with innuendo and noise, in order to cover up and make it as partisan as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.1/4">The Government had a choice this week, but they made the wrong one. They have rejected an independent inquiry to get to the truth of what has gone on in the banking industry when we could have had all-party agreement. They have rejected the opportunity to work on a cross-party basis and instead have sought to maximise narrow partisan interests. The result was the start of our debate today. The Government have rejected the opportunity to begin the work to reshape our banking industry so that it plays a positive role in Britain&#8217;s economic future and trust is restored, but I hope that Government Members will see sense and join us in the Lobby today. These issues are too important to be dealt with as the Government suggest and the British public will not be satisfied with anything less than a full, forensic and judge-led inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163.2/1">The debate got off to a difficult start and those watching it might have been driven to the conclusion that this was not the forum for a rational debate about the ethics and conduct of banking. Of course, the Government motion proposes a joint parliamentary inquiry, and those who have served on Select Committees and Joint Committees know that such inquiries are conducted in a far calmer atmosphere than the rather heated beginning of our debate, particularly if they are tempered by the presence of those from another place.

He also reinforced the imperative of reaching a unanimous conclusion, which often happens with Select Committees of the House. Indeed, he drew on his own experience on the Public Accounts Committee. My right hon. Friend cast some doubt on the December target, but my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester seemed content with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/3">I hope that Opposition Members will listen to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> said. He is a signatory to motion 2 on the Order Paper and made it clear that if that motion was not carried he would not oppose motion 3. That is the right approach if we are to resolve the issue this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/4">I am grateful, too, to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40138" name="John Thurso">the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase>, who made the point that the gap between the two sides was not quite as wide as the rhetoric at the beginning of our debate implied. He underlined the urgency of making progress, particularly if we are to catch the legislative train that is going through the House in this Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">The right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase> asked why the Government were against the inquiry proposed by the Opposition. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out in his speech the timetable for public inquiries and that was one reason why we did not think that that was the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40502" name="Mark Reckless">the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless)</phrase> made an interesting speech explaining the difference in culture that had occurred in the City, a point also made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40381" name="David Rutley">the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley)</phrase>, who was put off a career in the City by being asked the question, &#8220;How greedy are you?&#8221; One only has to look at him to realise that the answer is not at all, as he has the figure of a pipe-cleaner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> spoke on behalf of the thousands of people who work in banking who were not responsible in any way for what has occurred but whose reputations are now tarnished by the actions of a minority. She spoke on behalf of the hard-working majority in our banking services and supported the parliamentary inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/8">Many of the contributions underlined powerfully the need for urgent action to put out the fires that are threatening to engulf one of our leading financial institutions and to prevent further wrongdoing at the</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/9">heart of banking. Banking employs more than 1 million people, and it generates &#163;63 billion in Exchequer revenues and 8.9% of our gross domestic product.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/10">I do not think that there is any disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on what we need to do, which is to sustain a strong, vibrant, transparent and more accountable financial sector in the UK that commands international confidence. Although we are united on the direction of travel, there are clearly differences on the choice of vehicle and its speed. We favour a cross-party Joint Committee of both Houses that is accountable to Parliament; in operation before the summer recess; equipped to navigate the legal minefield of criminal investigations; and well positioned to produce recommendations that can be implemented through legislation that can be introduced in this Session. The Opposition, as we have heard, prefer a more costly public inquiry led by a judge and run by Queen&#8217;s Counsel and other lawyers that would coincide with and perhaps undermine other regulatory proceedings operating on a time scale that cannot easily be controlled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/11">Those who support the first motion should listen to what the former Cabinet Secretary Lord O&#8217;Donnell said in the debate in the upper House on Tuesday:</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/12">&#8220;I was involved very much in setting up the Leveson inquiry, and my experience of judge-led inquiries is that you have to be incredibly careful about tying them down to specific issues and timetables.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/13">That is what the Opposition are seeking to do. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/14">&#8220;What people have said they want from this specific inquiry means that it will grow bigger and take longer or that it will be incredibly superficial&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/15">Lord O&#8217;Donnell was not alone in expressing those concerns. Two other former Cabinet Secretaries voted against the Opposition&#8217;s proposals, and even Lord Eatwell, the Labour Treasury spokesman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/16">&#8220;I am supportive of the idea of a Joint Committee moving forward to deal with the specific implications and consequences of the LIBOR element&#8212;what Mr Tyrie refers to as the ring-fence proposals. &#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2012-07-03.617"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 July 2012; Vol. 738, c. 617-623</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/17">Some hon. Members have claimed that a parliamentary Committee will be unable to rise above the political fray. However, we all realise that a Committee report pushed through on party lines will quickly be devalued. Others have suggested that a parliamentary Committee would lack the inquisitive force of an inquiry barrister. I want to make it absolutely clear that a Joint Committee will have what it needs to carry out an inquiry including, if it wants them, resources for counsel. If we establish a Joint Committee we are fortunate to have more than 1,000 Members in both Houses with the necessary expertise to hold an inquiry. The advantage of a parliamentary Committee is that it is in a position to ensure that the recommendations are carried forward&#8212;something that we cannot have with a judge-led inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/18">A number of my hon. Friends have made the point that today&#8217;s debate has not just been about the conduct of the banks. To a lesser extent it has been about the capacity, reputation and relevance of parliamentary institutions to rise to the challenge. I have to say to those who resist a parliamentary inquiry that I have more confidence in the ability of Parliament and its</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/19">Committees to rise to the challenges that confront us this afternoon than all those who say we are the wrong people to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.1/20"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> did not make clear&#8212;and neither did the shadow Chancellor&#8212;whether, if motion 2 is defeated and motion 3 is carried, the Opposition will participate in the inquiry. I very much hope that if motion 2 is defeated the whole House will support motion 3. I hope that all parties will nominate those with the qualities needed, of whom there are many throughout both Houses, to the Joint Committee, and I hope that we can show the country that we have the ability and self-confidence to discharge the responsibilities placed on us and address the central issue at stake today&#8212;restoring confidence in the UK&#8217;s banking industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Government have won their vote. The Chair of the Treasury Committee will now chair a narrow inquiry based on the remit that he set out in the House this afternoon. The Opposition respect the hon. Gentleman and will work with him, but we have some real concerns about the membership and secretariat of the Joint Committee, which we hope he will address.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174.0/2">This afternoon&#8217;s debate, and particularly the devastating interventions of the Attorney-General, exposed serious questions about the scope of the inquiry&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.1174.2/1">It is clear that there is a wider set of questions, on matters from mis-selling to small businesses to the wider culture and practices of the banking industry, that are outside the scope of the inquiry set out by the Chair of the Treasury Committee and, in our view, cannot be properly addressed by any parliamentary</p>
	<p pid="a.1174.2/2">Committee. In our view, the case for a full, open, judge-led public inquiry is stronger at the end of this afternoon, and we will continue to press that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174.2/3">It is our view that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have made a grave error of judgment, and any time future scandals emerge, people will ask why we in this country are not having the full, independent public inquiry that our country needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.0/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I welcome the Opposition&#8217;s agreement in principle, as I take it, to take part in a joint parliamentary inquiry into what has happened. I suggest that the usual channels now work on the membership of that inquiry and that the Front-Bench teams and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> discuss any concerns that Opposition Front Benchers have about resourcing, the secretariat and so on. What everyone now wants to do is get a resolution that all parties can agree on, which we can bring to the House before it rises, so that we can get the Joint Committee up and running, get to the bottom of what went wrong in our banking industry and with the LIBOR scandal, and make the changes needed to legislation to ensure that it never happens again. I would welcome the Opposition&#8217;s support in doing that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think the whole House, and actually the whole country, will welcome the engagement that appears to be taking place across the Dispatch Boxes. I reiterate that I will do whatever the House asks me to do, but I believe it is worth my trying to chair the Committee only if it has the full support of all the major parties in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176.2/1">Before hon. Members go home, they might wish to interest themselves in whether we have Divisions after 7 o&#8217;clock next Wednesday, or whether we should arrange our business to ensure that any Divisions are before or no later than that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/2">The motion is highly relevant to that question and perhaps I can elucidate its implications. The first part of the motion puts a timetable on the length of the debate on the eight motions on the Order Paper relating to sittings of the House and September sittings. We might find that, in addition, amendments to those eight motions are tabled. I do not know how much interest there is among Members of the House in the subject, but it would be premature to curtail the debate to two hours. Why is it not possible to trust hon. Members to debate sittings of the House for as long or as short a period as they think is reasonable, having regard to the issues and the Procedure Committee report?</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/3">My first concern is that the first part of motion 4 limits the debate on the motions relating to sittings of the House and September sittings to two hours. In business questions today, the Leader of the House said that, immediately after debates on sittings of the House, there will be a debate on a motion on VAT on air ambulance fuel payments, which is one of the debates we were hoping to have today, but was squeezed out by the change of business. The motion is supported by a very large number of right hon. and hon. Members and there is a lot of interest in it, so I anticipate that the debate will last for up to three hours, which was the original time allocation. However, I would have thought that the motion would not cause controversy, and that the House would not divide on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/4">Under today&#8217;s business statement, we could have the first debate on the sittings of the House, followed by a three-hour debate on VAT on air ambulance fuel payments, and then, under the terms of the second part of motion 4, a three-hour debate on private business. Under <phrase class="standing-order" code="20">Standing Order No. 20</phrase>, on time for taking private business, traditionally and by convention, there has been a three-hour slot allocated to private business, so that the hon. Members concerned with it know exactly where they stand&#8212;what the issues are, and</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/5">when the debate will begin and end. There is quite a lot of subject matter in the private business set down for Wednesday, and I would have hoped that it would be possible to debate it during the time normally set aside for it, namely between 4 pm and 7 pm.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/6">It is important that hon. Members who want to involve themselves in any Divisions should be able to do so at a convenient hour, but if motion 4 was not carried this evening, we would have unlimited time to discuss the sittings of the House&#8212;the House could be responsible in its own way for how long that went on. After that, we would have the debate on the private business, unless the sittings of the House debate finished before 4 o&#8217;clock, in which case we could start the debate on VAT on ambulances, which could continue either at 7 o&#8217;clock or earlier, if the private business did not take the full three hours. That would prevent the problem of people being kept behind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/7">I say that because I and a few colleagues are what one might describe as specialists in holding promoters of private business to account. We like to ensure proper scrutiny. On several occasions, however, motions not dissimilar to this one have been allowed through, because none of us wants to be unnecessarily awkward. As a reward for allowing such motions to pass, however, the Chief Whip and other Whips have briefed against us, saying that, &#8220;Colleagues are being kept back because of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> or the hon. Member for this constituency or that constituency&#8221;&#8212;I will not mention their names, because it might embarrass them, but they might wish to participate in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.2/8">If we pass such a motion, then, the people indulging the business managers by agreeing to the motion find themselves effectively being put in the dock if the business of the House goes on much later than one would normally expect on a Wednesday.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177.0/1">Is it not true that the private business set down for consideration on Wednesday has been kicking around for several years? In some cases, it dates back to the 2007 Session. It could hardly be described as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I am sure that points like that&#8212;if not identical to it&#8212;will be made when we discuss the private business motions, because in essence they are motions on whether the House should agree with the other place that private Members&#8217; Bills that, as he says, have been hanging around in the House for a long time should be revived, or whether the promoters should be held to account for the enormous delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177.1/2">Some of the Bills relate to peddlers. We know that since those Bills first began five or more years ago, the Government have announced that they will introduce separate provisions relating to peddlers. I will not go into the merits or otherwise of those particular Bills, because you would rule me out of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the question of whether they should be further considered or should lapse owing to how long they have been kicking around needs to be debated. I anticipate that the people saying they should no longer be heard might want to</p>
	<p pid="a.1177.1/3">put the proposition to the vote, and I suggest that the voting take place at 7 o&#8217;clock on Wednesday rather than much later.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178.0/1">It occurs to me that there is a certain incongruity in extending Wednesday when the House will just have voted on the sitting hours.

	<p pid="a.1178.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, who, as so often, gets to the nub of the issue and the inconsistencies in the line taken by the business managers. Of course, we do not yet know what line officially they will take towards the sittings of the House, except that, judging by the motion, they think it desirable that we do not all have a say and that the debate be limited to two hours. I had not anticipated that we would have the chance to begin a debate on this important subject this evening.</p>

Friend not agree that the scope of the private business to be debated on Wednesday&#8212;provided it is given time&#8212;is extremely narrow and that it will be a challenge, even for the ingenuity of those who hold such Bills to account, to come up with a debate lasting three hours?</p>

	<p pid="a.1178.3/1">I hear what my hon. Friend says, and if he is right, that is all the more reason why we should not support this motion, because otherwise those of us who wish to debate the private business, including him, will find ourselves hanging around in the House until a three-hour debate about VAT for air ambulances has been completed. Our entitlement under Standing Orders to have our business debated between 4 o&#8217;clock and 7 o&#8217;clock will have been taken away from us, which would be very unfair.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178.5/1">We can speculate as much as we want to about what might or might not happen, but my experience in the House leads me to suppose that we always ought to look for the unexpected to happen on such occasions. We do not yet know how many amendments will be tabled to the sittings of the House motion or how contentious the debate will be on whether we should continue to have September sittings. It might all go through on the nod, in accordance with the primary suggestions of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40234" name="Greg Knight">the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr Knight)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, but it also might not.

	<p pid="a.1179.0/1">On the other side of the coin is the danger of having urgent questions or ministerial statements on that day. Indeed, I was present at business questions earlier, when the Leader of the House was not able to give an absolute assurance that that would not be the case next Wednesday.</p>

	<p pid="a.1179.1/1">That is another issue. We do not know: there may be very good reasons why Mr Speaker would allow an urgent question as a result of what happens on Tuesday. We cannot anticipate that, which is why we should make it clear that the Standing Orders of this House make specific provision to allow for three hours for private business. <phrase class="standing-order" code="20">Standing Order No. 20</phrase> specifies those hours as being between 4 o&#8217;clock and 7 o&#8217;clock on Wednesdays. If the private business does not take as long as those three hours, we can then get on to the following business sooner. If the issue of VAT for air ambulances comes up for debate before 4 o&#8217;clock, it can be adjourned at 4 o&#8217;clock and then resume as soon as the debate on the private business is concluded. For many years that has been the standard procedure. It is only during this Parliament that the Leader of the House and his deputy have started playing games with those of us who are concerned to ensure that we can hold those who bring forward private Bills and private business properly to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.1/2">I have been very indulgent and tried my best to explain the situation to colleagues who have been told by the Whips that they must stay until late at night because I have initiated a debate on private business that has gone on longer than it would have done if we had not conceded such motions. Frankly, I am fed up. Why should I be blamed for keeping the House late, when the situation is the direct responsibility of motions brought forward by the Leader of the House and his deputy? I am keen&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.1180.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak again on this important and topical issue. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40321" name="Lynne Featherstone">the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> and I have been here before on a Thursday evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/2">In April this year, a Birmingham dentist, Dr Omar Addow, told undercover reporters from <i>The Sunday Times</i> that female genital mutilation was &#8220;not allowed in this country&#8221; He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/3">&#8220;These are very private and secret things...It must be confidential but I think it&#8217;s better you go to Africa...I can give you some medication...I can help you.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/4">The same report quoted Mohammed Sahib, an alternative medicine practitioner from Barking, east London, offering to carry out FGM on a 10-year-old girl for just &#163;750. The actions described by those men are illegal under this country&#8217;s law, as the House will know. Under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, which built on the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, it is illegal to take girls abroad for FGM or to facilitate that process in any way. The 2003 Act extended extraterritorial protection to all UK residents and citizens. However, it seems that those legal protections are still being flouted and thousands of young British girls every year face the prospect of becoming victims of a serious and violent form of child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/5">I am glad that the dentist, Dr Addow, and the doctor who referred the reporters to him, Dr Mao-Aweys, were arrested and that their respective professional bodies are investigating the matter. As an aside, though, I would question why it took a newspaper to expose that activity. Why was it not on the police&#8217;s radar, or that of local health officials? Or is it the case of &#8220;where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way&#8221;? I will return to the key role that must be played by front-line professionals later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/6">Members will be aware of my interest in female genital mutilation and of the all-party parliamentary group on the issue, which I chair. I am grateful to the many Members who have taken an interest in the subject over the past year. I have spoken before about this barbaric practice still being carried out across the world and I believe that it is still being practised on girls who live in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/7">The World Health Organisation defines FGM as any</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/8">&#8220;procedure that intentionally alters or causes injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/9">The WHO and the United Nations also recognise FGM as a human rights violation. I will not go into great detail about the devastating effects of FGM&#8212;I have covered those subjects before&#8212;but it results in girls, usually under the age of 10, facing a lifetime of pain and many significant physical and mental health problems. Today, I want to focus on those girls who are most at risk of being taken overseas in the long summer holidays by their families to have FGM inflicted on them&#8212;the theory being that the holiday break gives the girls time to &#8220;heal&#8221; before returning to school in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/10">There are many who downplay the issue or deny that FGM is a problem in the UK, and trying to eradicate a practice that is shrouded in such secrecy and to establish the evidence base for one&#8217;s arguments is, by definition, difficult. However, I believe that some girls in the UK are at risk of suffering FGM, and I would like to offer the House some facts from which that conclusion can reasonably be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/11">The last comprehensive study into FGM prevalence in the UK was carried out in 2007, and was itself extrapolated from the 2001 census figures based on settlement in the UK from FGM-practising regions of the world, such as east Africa. That study has become the main source of statistics for debate on FGM in the UK ever since. Although we need a fresh comprehensive study, it should be noted that the Forward study has been peer-reviewed in the past six months by a panel of European experts and its methodology remains robust. The study&#8217;s figures also received an update in the report on harmful cultural practices, &#8220;The Missing Link&#8221;, commissioned by the Greater London authority last November.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/12">We cannot precisely determine the persistence of FGM as a cultural practice in the communities that have resettled in the UK. Some reports have found a falling away of the practice, while others have found an aggressive re-commitment to it among diaspora communities. However, we know from freedom of information figures obtained by media organisations last year that the number of women seeking treatment for FGM has increased in recent years. The London <i>Evening Standard</i> reported that, in 2010, 442 women in 11 London NHS trusts sought treatment for FGM and related complications, often associated with pregnancy and childbirth&#8212;a 30% increase on 2007. This would suggest that, even if&#8212;and it is a very big if&#8212;the percentage of girls and women having had FGM is falling in the UK, the increased volume of migration from practising countries and regions would still mean that there is a net increase in the number of women and girls with, or at risk of, FGM. This is of particular concern as the UK has seen significant migration from Somalia, where World Health Organisation estimates put FGM percentage prevalence in the high 90s, and where the most extreme form of FGM is widely practised. I highlight Somalia for a reason: Puntland, a large region in north-east Somalia, has recently passed a law that indemnifies families who inflict sunna-type FGM on their girls, even if the girls die as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/13">Over the last year, I have attended conferences held by health practitioners, including midwives, gynaecologists and obstetricians who have illustrated that more women were presenting for childbirth with FGM, many of them then asking to be reinfibulated&#8212;that effectively means sewn back up&#8212;or coming in for the birth of a later child, with clear evidence of reinfibulation after the birth of their earlier children. This does not support any conclusion that there is a rapid rate of abandonment of this practice in the UK, and these women&#8217;s daughters should be considered at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/14">Although, regrettably, there have been no prosecutions for FGM-related crimes in the UK in the last 25 years, people have been successfully prosecuted and convicted</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/15">in other comparable European countries, most of which have significantly smaller communities from FGM-practising regions than the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/16">In the light of the evidence I have presented, I hope the House will agree it is reasonable to conclude that a substantial number of young girls living in Britain today are at risk of becoming victims of FGM. I will focus my remaining comments on what more we can do to reduce that risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/17">I want to be clear&#8212;I have said this before&#8212;that this is not about picking on one culture or another. Just as we celebrate cultural diversity in our country, however, we cannot shy away from difficult issues because of cultural sensitivities. Proper regard for people&#8217;s cultural heritage has become warped by over-sensitivity, and harmful cultural practices have not always been challenged as strongly as they should have been. The feedback from health professionals at the conferences I have attended is that they do feel constrained and they worry about deterring patients from presenting. Some teachers I have spoken to, although charged with safeguarding these children, were completely ignorant of FGM and some admitted their guidelines were, at best, embryonic. Most conversations with front-line professionals quickly come round to cultural sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/18">Even a recent detailed report on the Somali community in a particular London borough did not contain a single mention of FGM, or even an allusion to it, despite the fact that it is probably the most serious health issue faced by women in the British Somali community. The authors said that community leaders were very sensitive about the issue and did not want it mentioned. This is an oft-repeated pattern, and it will continue as long as we&#8212;politicians are the worst offenders here&#8212;continue to address issues affecting women and children in minority communities via their community leaders who are overwhelmingly male and often very socially conservative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/19">We have to ask ourselves what we care about more&#8212;the sensitivities of community leaders or the health and well-being of our children? And they are our children. We do not affirm their equality in our country by denying them the protection of our laws and the excellent safeguarding guidelines that exist but are not routinely implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/20">I have mentioned the last comprehensive study into FGM prevalence by Forward. Although still robust, it needs updating, and in my Adjournment debate speech last November, I asked the Minister to consider funding a national study into FGM prevalence. I commend her and thank her for funding, and therefore making possible, the two-day preparatory research workshop co-ordinated by Equality Now. I know she is considering its findings. Although many of the recommendations relate to other Departments&#8212;in particular, the Department of Health&#8212;I hope she will commit to work with colleagues to respond positively to the workshop.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/21">I am also very pleased to see that the Home Office has worked with the Southall Black Sisters to produce the excellent &#8220;Three steps to escaping violence against women and girls&#8221; guide, which includes FGM. Will the Minister tell us how this is being used, how wide is its distribution and whether it has been sent to local education authorities and/or head teachers by the Department for Education? The chief medical officer wrote to all GPs and other health professionals in May this year with</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/22">some excellent guidance on treating FGM and protecting at-risk girls. I feel that something similar is needed for schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/23">Helping parents to protect their own children is also important. Work done by the charity Forward in 2009 found that some women from at-risk communities were reluctant to cut their daughters and felt that the pressure to do so had diminished in the UK. One reason that was identified was that those women no longer had to deal with pressure from extended family members, particularly grandmothers. That is especially relevant in the context of tonight&#8217;s debate about girls who risk being taken abroad for the long summer holidays, where they and their parents may be exposed to such family pressure for extended periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/24">The parents who do not want to cut need to be supported in resisting the pressure to inflict FGM on their young daughters. Simple measures such as the &#8220;health passport&#8221; which was introduced in the Netherlands last year, and whose introduction is being considered here, could go a long way towards empowering parents to stand up to family pressure. Can the Minister update the House on any progress towards the introduction of a &#8220;health passport&#8221; for England and Wales before the school summer holidays? If that cannot be done this year, I hope that it will definitely be done next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/25">I understand that the Minister met a delegation of young people in Bristol yesterday to talk about what could be done about FGM. Can she also update the House on their views about the best way in which they feel they can safeguard their own health? No doubt she will join me in commending the work of the Bristol safeguarding children board and that of key professionals such as Nurse Jacalyn Mathers, who have done excellent work to tackle FGM. Much can be learnt from the work in Bristol across many Departments, and I am sure that the Minister will have details of their action plan. The Mayor of London&#8217;s Office for Policing and Crime is also developing a pilot initiative, which the all-party group will follow with great interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/26">Will the Minister join me in encouraging MPs with at-risk girls in their constituencies to ask the right questions in the next few weeks when they visit schools? They should ask head teachers, as I have, whether their staff know the signs to look out for, and are clear about what to do if they suspect that a girl is at risk. Health and education professionals must be alert to indicators that FGM may be about to happen. Those include talk of and requests for extended holidays, preparations for so-called special ceremonies, and requests for travel vaccinations or anti-malarial medication. The <i>British Medical Journal </i>recently carried helpful guidance to doctors on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/27">Has the Minister had any conversations with other Departments about the heightened risk of FGM at this time of year? For example, has she had&#8212;or could she have&#8212;any discussions with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#8217;s excellent forced marriage unit, with a view to learning from its experience of safeguarding UK minors overseas?</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/28">In February this year, the Minister assured me during Women and Equalities questions that she would undertake to ensure that UK border staff read the safeguarding guidelines. Perhaps she can update us on whether that has happened. While on the subject of borders, may I commend the work of the charity Children and Families</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/29">Across Borders, and ask the Minister to consider the comprehensive plan that it has prepared to identify and track at-risk girls? It is too late for that to be done this year, but the project could make a big difference in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/30">Let me quote again from the article which was published in <i>The Sunday Times</i> in April:</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/31">&#8220;&#8216;It is not possible, we cannot do that&#8217;, one man said. &#8216;The only advice I can give you, if you can, if possible, take your sister or your daughter to another country that allows&#8230; it&#8217;s no problem... You know in this country you have to fight for... your cultures. They don&#8217;t like your cultures.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.2/32">Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, FGM is not culture; it is child abuse. We must stand firm on that point and match our words with action, and I very much hope that further action will result from this debate. We must work together to put additional practical barriers in the way of those who, this summer, are planning to blight the life of a child with a blade. If we can save only one little girl from that fate, the House will have spent its time well this evening.</p>

She works tirelessly on this important agenda, and I entirely agree with her that genital mutilation is an unacceptable form of abuse against girls and women. We know that at this time of year, just before the start of the school holidays, girls are at much greater risk of being taken abroad for the purpose of FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.0/2">My hon. Friend asked a number of questions, and I shall try to deal with all of them. Let me begin by saying that preventing FGM is at the heart of the Government&#8217;s ambition. This summer, leaflets and posters, staff fact sheets and training videos about FGM have been distributed to all children&#8217;s centres in London by the Metropolitan police to raise awareness among those who work with parents and children in affected communities. The police are also refreshing their training for officers throughout London, reminding them of their role in safeguarding women and girls at risk of FGM. This awareness-raising is something we can all do, to ensure all front-line staff are able to respond to victims. Although there is not much time left before the summer holidays, I will encourage all MPs to write to their local schools, raising this issue and pointing out that schools should look for signs of potential risk, especially at this time of year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184.1/1">Will my hon. Friend also highlight that this is not just an Africa problem? I went on an all-party group trip to Indonesia, and how the Indonesian Government deal with it is fascinating. There is localism in Indonesia&#8217;s 17,000 islands, and in islands where there is strict sharia law they hand out clean tissues and good medical equipment, but they do not ban the practice. This is a problem in countries across the world, therefore.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184.2/3">Additionally, the Department of Health continues to ensure that health professionals are able to respond to women and girls at risk, and it has focused on communications, which will extend throughout the summer period. A short film about FGM will be launched for the NHS Choices website. The film will be available to the public and is aimed at raising awareness among families, young girls and all professionals who may come into contact with girls and families who may be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/4">In May, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40288" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, who has responsibility for public health, wrote to the royal colleges and NHS agencies, encouraging them to raise awareness of FGM among professionals. It is shocking that many of them still do not know enough about it, even though so much information is available. The Health Department&#8217;s chief medical officer and director of nursing, with the support of the royal colleges, wrote to health professionals drawing their attention to FGM and the multi-agency practice guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea raised the issue of Puntland, Somalia. The recent legislation on FGM in Puntland needs to be understood in the context of a broader ongoing political and constitutional process&#8212;however frustrating that is&#8212;which means that it would not be helpful for us to challenge it at this time. A number of key players in Puntland are working towards the abandonment of FGM, although I acknowledge what my hon. Friend said about that not being successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1185.0/1">I am well aware that the British Government made significant efforts before this legislation was passed, and that this issue was raised at the Somalia conference. I just wanted to highlight why girls from that region in particular might be at risk, as the culture is still very prevalent there.</p>

	<p pid="a.1185.1/1">I think I must have misunderstood my hon. Friend&#8217;s point. We have been working there, and a number of key players in Puntland are working towards making progress as well, including the President himself, religious leaders and UN agencies. I have recently begun to question our work with leaders in communities and countries where such practices are so embedded, however. The Somalia FGM taskforce, of which the UK is an active and vocal member, is of the view that working to support these individuals, and working with the diaspora, is the best approach to supporting the abandonment of the practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.1/2">I am pleased to be able to say that there are encouraging developments on the international stage. During my visit to Ethiopia in April, I met Dr Bogaletch, a founder of KMG&#8212;Kembatta Women&#8217;s Self-Help Centre. She has worked in Ethiopia since 1997, with the goal of creating an environment where the rights of women are recognised. It has managed to mobilise communities to</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.1/3">review long-held beliefs critically and honestly, allowing the communities themselves to question the practice and empower individuals to ignite change. I met her recently when she came over to this country, and she is going to supply us with the tools and the pathway&#8212;the route that she uses in communities. Her work is very interesting. I do not know whether it is directly transferable to the diaspora here, but there may be something in it. Although we are trying to make progress with prosecutions, progress is agonisingly slow, so we should leave no stone unturned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.1/4">What I want to highlight today is the incredible social change that young people themselves are driving forward. My hon. Friend mentioned the young women from Bristol, I believe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186.1/1">Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting a group of inspiring young women who are working on projects run by Daughters of Eve and Integrate Bristol, speaking out against FGM. They are dedicated girls, and with the support of Home Office funding have written a stage play that tackles FGM. They are using poetry to address FGM, which is quite clever because it is less head-on and does not arouse the anger that they face in some other contexts. They are leading peer-mentoring workshops to educate others about FGM, and they are preparing to deliver a national conference. Their innovation, passion and dedication to educate others demonstrate the power of community activity. They are not scared to stand up as women and speak out to protect others. Such qualities and action are vital to ensure a safer future for the next generation, and their work is truly inspirational. Of all the people I have met during discussions about tackling FGM, those young women were particularly inspiring. If they are a sign of things to come&#8212;if only we could clone them or multiply them&#8212;change will come. They are the agents of change and offer great hope that we can move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/2">In the next few months I intend to organise a round-table meeting to understand what methods are working and what more we need to do. I want to have a very open discussion with some of our key partners in the work on FGM. Have we, for example, been taking the right approach in asking leaders in communities that practise FGM to be the agents of change themselves? As someone recently pointed out to me, would we ask rapists what to do about rape? We have to temper such views with a recognition that we do need to work with communities. At this round table, I want to take a very fresh look with all our key partners, such as social workers and the police. I will focus the meeting on how we create a step change in approach in order to engage communities in the UK. We need this now in order to progress the good work being done across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/3">My hon. Friend works tirelessly on this issue, I am putting a lot of effort into it, and Members on both sides of the House take it seriously. Progress is good but slow, given the size of the population where this practice is prevalent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/4">My hon. Friend raised the issue of updating the evidence base in the UK. Learning from international development was not the only commitment I made to this House in November. I am also committed to looking</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/5">at updating the statistical and quantitative evidence base. My hon. Friend made the powerful point that the records are outdated, even if the methodology is still robust. As she mentioned, the Home Office funded the organisation Equality Now to carry out a small methodological workshop. I have just received the final report from Equality Now, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank it for all its work. I have noted the recommendations, which my hon. Friend has said she supports, and I have asked officials to convene a meeting with Equality Now to ensure the findings are fully discussed with the Home Office, colleagues across government and other interested organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/6">My hon. Friend asked me about the leaflets produced by the Home Office and Southall Black Sisters in February. The leaflet was translated into 12 languages and has been distributed to more than 30 embassies in the UK and to asylum screening units for women and girls claiming asylum in the UK. The document can also be found on the Home Office website and we are happy to speak to the Department for Education to try to ensure that LEAs and education professionals are aware of the document.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/7">In November, I also committed to look at the use of the document used in Holland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1187.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I could not agree with her more. I have some idea how we might approach the subject and I am happy to talk to the Department for Education. Schools are the</p>
	<p pid="a.1187.1/2">right place to deal with this and at the moment the message is not getting through.</p>
	<p pid="a.1187.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned the health passport, which is an information leaflet about the legislation relating to FGM for use by families and girls when they travel abroad. After careful research, I am pleased to announce that we will develop something similar and test it within the next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1188.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend, as she is the one who brought up the idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188.1/2">In the UK, we propose that the document, which we will call a &#8220;Declaration against FGM&#8221;, will state that FGM is a criminal offence, including when a British citizen is outside the UK, and what the penalties are for anyone found committing or aiding the offence. Additionally, it will include important advice and contact details for help and support. We hope that it will be an additional tool for families and girls who travel abroad that will clearly state the UK position. It will also complement the refresher training being given to consular staff over the summer and all consular staff will be aware of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188.1/3">Once again, I thank my hon. Friend for securing the debate and for her continued determination to bring the subject to people&#8217;s attention.</p>
