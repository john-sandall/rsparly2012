	<p pid="a.678.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree, however, that there is no prospect of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point or anywhere else in the UK until we have absolute clarity about the contracts for difference regime? That clarity must extend to the credit status of the counter-party, compliance with EU state aid regime and the setting of the strike price. Will the Minister tell us when we will have that clarity?</p>

	<p pid="a.681.0/1">My hon. Friend is quite right to point to the fact that one of the reasons for bringing forward electricity market reform and the energy Bill is to ensure that we meet this country&#8217;s energy infrastructure needs, which are huge, as we see 20% of power plants coming offline over the next decade and the need to make the transition to low-carbon energy. That is a huge challenge, which could be very expensive for consumers. One of the reasons we need to reform the electricity market is therefore to ensure that that infrastructure investment can be made at the lowest cost imaginable.</p>

	<p pid="a.688.6/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. Later this month when we publish the energy Bill, he will see that we have very ambitious electricity market reforms to deliver, among other things, energy security in the future. We need investment of &#163;110 billion in our energy infrastructure over the next decade. That is a real task, and we need to make sure that there are incentives to bring forward that low carbon investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.693.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for his announcement of next week&#8217;s business, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> on her re-election unopposed to the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/2">Analysis of last week's Queen&#8217;s Speech has demonstrated that this Government have already run out of ideas. Of the 19 announced Bills, three are carry-overs from the previous Session, and now we learn that the passage of as many as five of the new Bills might be delayed until the next Session, making this by far the slimmest Queen&#8217;s Speech in living memory. Will the Leader of the House tell us why?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/3">Today is the international day against homophobia and transphobia, and it is right that we mark it in this House. There are five countries where people can be sentenced to death for being lesbian or gay, and 76 where it is still illegal. We should pay tribute to all those who are bravely campaigning for equality around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/4">Will the Leader of the House arrange for the equalities Minister to make a statement on the Government's proposals for equal marriage? This weekend, the Defence Secretary said that it was &#8220;not a priority&#8221;, and the Under-Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40233" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase>, said that he is &quot;totally opposed&quot;, but across the country there are couples who want to know whether to have a civil partnership, or to wait until the law is changed. What they do not want is to be in limbo while Conservative MPs fight among themselves and the Government prevaricate. The Prime Minister has said it is an important matter of equality. I agree. Will the Government now commit quickly to introducing legislation on equal marriage?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/5">The whole House will be concerned about the eurozone crisis. On Monday, the Chancellor said</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/6">&#8220;the open speculation from some members in the eurozone about the future of some countries in the eurozone&#8230;is doing real damage across the whole European economy&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/7">only for the Prime Minister to indulge in precisely that speculation two days later. The Government&#8217;s plan A has pushed us back into recession. It has failed in Britain and it is now failing across Europe. Instead of</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/8">manoeuvring to blame Europe for his failed economic policy, the Prime Minister should be pushing for a solution to the eurozone crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/9">At the election, Government Members promised not to cut front-line services, but that is exactly what the Home Secretary has done. More than 5,000 police officer jobs have been cut. When she spoke to the Police Federation conference yesterday, the right hon. Lady insisted the podium be shifted, because she did not want to be filmed in front of a conference slogan opposing police cuts. She can shift the podium and the camera angle, but she cannot shift the responsibility. Will the Leader of the House arrange for the Home Secretary to make a statement on police numbers so that she can explain what happened to their manifesto promise not to cut front-line staff?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/10">While the Home Secretary is at it, she could also explain the ongoing immigration shambles at Heathrow. Every week we hear reports of thousands of people stuck at immigration and passengers queuing for hours while immigration desks are closed. It takes something when even Joan Collins feels the need to tweet from the queue that the Home Secretary should get a grip. And it is not just the Home Secretary; the Immigration Minister&#8217;s justification for the shambles at Heathrow&#8217;s border control was that it was the result of the wrong type of wind. What is it about this Government and the weather? First they blamed the economy&#8217;s performance on the snow, then the excuse was the wrong type of rain, and now we have the wrong type of wind. May we have a statement on the ministerial code? Does the Leader of the House intend to amend the code to say that Ministers are responsible unless they can blame the weather or, perhaps, their special advisers?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/11">At Justice questions this week neither the Secretary of State nor his deputy were present. The ministerial code states that Ministers are accountable to this House, so they should at least turn up for departmental questions rather than leaving it to junior Ministers and Whips to do their work for them. Will the Leader of the House undertake to make sure that senior Ministers are present for oral questions in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.3/12">Justice Ministers dodge their responsibilities to the House, the Home Secretary refuses to take responsibility for her police cuts, the Immigration Minister refuses to take responsibility for the shambles at Heathrow and the Chancellor refuses to take responsibility for a double-dip recession made in Downing street. What a way to start the new parliamentary Session.</p>

	<p pid="a.698.1/1">I applaud the work that my hon. Friend does as Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee and his involvement in the group he mentions. If the Committee did a report on these issues it could provide a route for their finding their way into a debate through the liaison committee. Alternatively, he could apply to the newly established Backbench Business Committee for a debate on the subject, or he might find it possible to speak about it at next Thursday&#8217;s pre-recess Adjournment debate and get a response from my hon.

	<p pid="a.712.5/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move an amendment, at the end of the Question to add:</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8216;but regrets that whilst the UK economy is in recession, long-term unemployment is at its highest level since 1996 and one million young people are out of work the Gracious Speech contains no measures to address this crisis; notes that Britain will pay a long-term price for a prolonged period of slow growth and high unemployment; further notes that France, Germany and the Eurozone as a whole are not in recession while in the USA, where the Government has to date taken a more balanced approach to support economic recovery, the economy is now one per cent bigger than before the global financial crisis, while the UK economy is now 4.3 per cent smaller; recognises the criticism expressed by business leaders that your Government has not come forward with an adequate plan to boost economic growth; believes that cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast is self-defeating as slow growth and higher unemployment means that your Government is now set to borrow &#163;150 billion more than planned; and calls on your Government to introduce a fair and balanced deficit plan, with measures to stimulate economic growth and job creation which are essential to get the deficit down, including a tax on bank bonuses to fund a guaranteed job for every young person out of work for more than a year, a temporary cut in VAT, a national insurance holiday for small firms taking on extra workers, and bringing forward infrastructure investment to strengthen the economy for the long-term.&#8217;.</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/3">It is a great honour to open the final day of this Queen&#8217;s Speech debate, and to do so in this very special diamond jubilee year. But I have to say how disappointing it is, with our economy now pushed into recession, the eurozone crisis deepening, and businesses and families up and down the country crying out for a plan for jobs and growth, that we are today debating what is widely regarded to be a disappointing and directionless Queen&#8217;s Speech programme from a Tory-led coalition that has, frankly, lost its way.</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/4">What a change this is from two years ago. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke in the debate on the Government&#8217;s first Queen&#8217;s Speech, four weeks after</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/5">the general election and two weeks before his first Budget, he was bursting with hubris. He was so sure of himself that, when the then shadow Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, and many other hon. Members on this side of the House asked whether the Chancellor&#8217;s planned to bring forward immediate and deep tax rises and said that spending cuts might choke off the recovery, the Chancellor dismissed those concerns out of hand. He was confident that his plan would</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/6">&#8220;deal with our debts, set our country on a brighter economic course and show that we are all in this together.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-06-08.206"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 June 2010; Vol. 511, c. 206</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/7">What a difference two years makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/8">&#8220;We are all in this together&#8221;: we do not hear that line any more&#8212;not from a Chancellor whose Budget decisions have hit middle and lower-income families harder than those on the highest incomes. His Budget decisions have hit women harder than men and families with children harder still. The Institute for Fiscal Studies confirms that his Budgets have been regressive and will see child poverty rise. Last month&#8217;s omnishambles of a Budget included decisions to raise taxes on caravans, charity donations, church repairs, pensioners, pasties and petrol, but to have a top-rate tax cut only for the richest&#8212;a &#163;3 billion tax cut, which will give 14,000 of the richest people in our society earning over &#163;1 million an average tax cut of &#163;40,000 a year. Millions are paying more in tax to pay for a tax cut for millionaires. No wonder the Chancellor and the Prime Minister can no longer bring themselves to say that &#8220;We are all in this together&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/9">Let me remind the Chancellor of what the chair of the Conservative Association in Harlow said last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/10">&#8220;The voters are disillusioned with Cameron himself. They don&#8217;t like the fact that he did not keep the 50p tax. People feel he is not working for them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.712.5/11">Apparently, the Chancellor was advised precisely not to cut the top rate by his own Downing street pollster, Mr Andrew Cooper. Let me say to the Chancellor that, in my experience, disregarding the wise advice of someone called Cooper can be a very dangerous course to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.714.6/1">The right thing to do after the financial crisis, was to do things in a fair way. That is why the 50p tax rate was right at the time. The reason why the Budget has gone down so badly is that lowering the 50p rate was seen as so unfair. The hon. Gentleman was right in what he said just a few days ago. In his blog a few days ago he said that the Government have a communication problem and are over-confident. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.714.6/2">&#8220;The manner in which Downing Street fires out policies and expects us to agree and applaud without question certainly smacks of a sense of superiority.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.717.4/1">The right course is to take a balanced approach that combines medium-term deficit reduction with getting jobs and growth moving. The problem with austerity is that it chokes off jobs and growth and ends up costing more in spending, more in unemployment and more in borrowing. We have set out a clear alternative. We have said &#8220;Repeat the bank bonus tax, and use the money to create jobs.&#8221; We have said &#8220;Rip up the failed national insurance cut introduced by the Chancellor, and use the money for a tax cut for small businesses.&#8221; We have said &#8220;Yes, cut VAT by &#163;12 billion for a year to get the economy moving.&#8221; We have not said how many shovel-ready infrastructure projects can be launched, because we do not have the details.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.4/2">The Prime Minister says that you cannot borrow our way out of a debt crisis, but unless you grow, your debts get bigger and your deficits get worse. That is what the Chancellor has proved over the last two years. It is not only the Labour party that is advancing that argument. Only last week, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund said:</p>
	<p pid="a.717.4/3">&#8220;We know that fiscal austerity holds back growth and the effects are worse in downturns... so the right pace is essential&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.4/4">Even the head of the European Central Bank is now pressing for a jobs and growth plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.4/5">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor must wake up to the fact that our economy has not grown on their watch for a year and a half. Instead of trying to divert the blame for their failure and using the eurozone as an excuse for Britain's problems, they must admit that they got it wrong&#8212;that they gave the eurozone the wrong advice&#8212;and start pushing for the right solution to the eurozone crisis. I agree that there should be a proper role for the European Central Bank and a greater emphasis on fiscal burden-sharing, but there should also be a change of course on austerity, because only a balanced plan that puts jobs and growth first will succeed in getting the deficit down. When the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and even the United States are urging policies for jobs and growth, this Chancellor and this Prime Minister are looking increasingly isolated and out on a limb.</p>

	<p pid="a.718.3/1">Calm down. Calm down, or we will start a debate about Remploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/2">Of course the eurozone crisis is very serious and very dangerous for our economy and for all economies. That is why our Prime Minister and Chancellor should be at the table leading debates about the solution rather than carping on the sidelines, sitting like a teenager in the front of the car with headphones on while the crisis happens around them.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/3">These are the facts. Last year, eurozone growth was faster than British growth and was revised up. Our growth was slower and was revised down. Last year, it was only the eurozone that prevented the British economy from going into recession earlier. Our domestic economy, excluding exports, was actually in recession for pretty much all of last year. The eurozone economy was</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/4">growing when the British economy went into recession. Even today, the eurozone is not in recession and the British economy is.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/5" class="italic">[Interruption.] </p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/6">The Welfare Secretary has made a career of blaming Europe for everything that goes wrong in Britain, but I am afraid that this is a recession made in Downing street.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/7">The Chancellor will also try to claim today&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Calm down. The Chancellor will also try to claim today that all this pain will be worth it in the end. However, we are paying a long-term price for the failures that we now see around us&#8212;the national debt higher; living standards down; long-term youth unemployment becoming entrenched; more than 24,000 companies out of business since he became Chancellor; investment plans cancelled or diverted overseas; our economy weaker; and capacity lost. I very much fear that when the economy finally recovers, as it eventually will, it will be more prone to inflationary pressures than otherwise, because of the failures of this Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid="a.720.4/1">The economy is in recession and they hate it, and so do business organisations up and down the country. Is it any wonder that businesses have been so disappointed and upset by the Queen&#8217;s Speech of just two weeks ago? Let me quote the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/2">&#8220;There is a big black hole when it comes to aiding business to create enterprise, generate wealth and grow.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/3">Quite right, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/4">There will be some parts of the Queen&#8217;s Speech dealing with Treasury matters which we will support. On banking reform, we will look forward to supporting legislation to strengthen capital ratios and promote competition; although it is now nine months since the final report of the Vickers commission, and we are still waiting for a response from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, after 18 months of flatlining, with our economy now in recession and business investment depressed, the question I ask&#8212;it is the question British business is asking too&#8212;is this. Where is the plan in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to restore confidence and promote business investment and jobs in Britain?</p>
	<p pid="a.720.4/5">With net lending falling month on month&#8212;according to the Bank of England it has been down every month for over two years now&#8212;where is the action in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to promote small business lending? With youth unemployment now at a record high, and with yesterday&#8217;s figures confirming that long-term unemployment among young people is still rising, where is the legislation in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to get our young people back to work? Where is the legislation to repeat the bank bonus tax to fund a jobs guarantee for young people&#8212;or, for that matter, to cut taxes for small businesses hiring new workers, or to help the construction sector with a temporary cut in VAT? Our economy has ground to a halt and our construction sector is in great distress. Where is the plan to support jobs and growth by bringing forward new infrastructure projects? Where is the legislation to make our economy stronger and fairer for the future? Stronger corporate governance; a business investment bank; progress on high-speed rail; reforms in our universities to promote innovation&#8212;all are completely absent from this Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p>

	<p pid="a.731.2/1">First, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his work as Second Church Estates Commissioner. He has been in discussions with me and the Treasury about how to make sure that we live up to the commitment I gave in the Budget that Churches and other places of worship would not be impacted by the introduction of VAT on alterations to listed buildings. Of course, it is already charged on repairs to listed buildings. I have been in discussions with my hon. Friend and with the Bishop of London, whom the Churches asked to lead on that work, and I confirm that we have reached agreement. The Government will provide &#163;30 million of grant to the listed places of worship scheme. That will be 100% compensation, exactly as we promised in the Budget, for the additional cost borne by churches for alterations. It should also go a long way towards helping the situation on repairs and maintenance, where in recent years they have not been able to get 100% compensation. We think it will deliver 100% coverage for repairs and maintenance. I thank my hon. Friend and the churches for working with us on delivering what we promised in the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.736.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful and informative intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.1/2">When the Chancellor talked about a growing economy, one of my hon. Friends shouted, from a sedentary position, &#8220;Not in the north-east.&#8221; We need to recognise that worklessness does not impact equally on all communities. That is why when we think about the growth we need, policy needs to be tailored properly to the economy in each and every part of the country, so that the GDP growth we all hope for represents the whole of the UK. I suppose it is entirely possible that the UK will recover, but leave behind heavily blighted areas of our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.1/3">A study of unemployment reveals a key flaw in the Government&#8217;s thinking. They have talked about &#8220;expansionary fiscal contraction&#8221;&#8212;in other words, to achieve growth, the Government need to slash their budgets and investment will flow in from foreign shores. I do not believe that that is consistent with the Government&#8217;s other stated aim: to rebalance the economy. Finance for those parts of our economy that have strengths in manufacturing but need regeneration is necessarily long term. Government industrial strategy should shelter our industry from global headwinds, not leave us vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.1/4">Fiscal contraction at the pace we have seen has harmed blighted areas that had only recently started to recover from the impact of previous Conservative Governments&#8217; attitude to industry. In my area, I see the impact of the withdrawal of central Government from regeneration and the stopping of regional growth via regional development agencies. The responses built into local government that were designed to target deprivation, which clusters in particular parts of our country, were stripped away in the financial settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.1/5">In the Budget, the Chancellor introduced measures that took money out of the pockets of people on low and middle incomes in those parts of the country where we want to rebalance to. That will not help. Someone in the Treasury has to take responsibility for looking at the macro impact of all the measures that are affecting those places that stand to be the worst affected by this Government. We have had a botched Budget and then a next-to-nothing Queen&#8217;s Speech, I am sorry to say. The Government will be judged by the people in Wirral and Merseyside not merely on the GDP figures, but on the actual development we see in our city. We must take account of the differential impacts of Government measures on different parts of the country with different economies; we must not focus only on the national picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.1/6">My question for the Government is: will they meet the test of real economic development? Only that will promote the widespread employment that people want. People will judge this Government on the basis of whether or not they see their friends and family in employment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.738.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40407" speakername="David Davies" colnum="738"  time="013:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0002.htm#12051738000065">
	<p pid="a.738.1/1">No, I have no more time to give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/2">I want to know why Labour Members still maintain that the banks are to blame, when, in all, just &#163;120 billion was given to the banks out of a total debt of &#163;1 trillion, almost 10 times more. They are following the policy of fools, knaves and despots throughout history started by Edward I, who blamed everything on bankers. The reality is that, every year, we are borrowing more from banks than we have given them. We get 10% of our revenue&#8212;&#163;50 billion a year&#8212;from the banking industry. If Labour Members are allowed to destroy it, they will have to find cuts 10 times greater than the ones that we, unfortunately, have already had to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/3">This Government are taking proper and concrete steps and I think that most Members present support almost all those measures. I totally agree with the decision to reform welfare spending, so that people have to go out to work, and at the same time to cap immigration, which has held down wages for the lowest paid, as even Opposition Members have been the first to accept. As one who has experience of trying to run a small business, I am delighted that the Government will do something to reduce the red tape of employment legislation, which makes many businesses reluctant to take people on. It is, of course, a pleasure to read about cuts in corporation tax and, yes, even the cut in tax for top rate taxpayers. We know that that is politically difficult to defend, but there is a strong economic argument for the measure, which is why Labour Members were not prepared to vote against it and will not now say what they will do.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/4">In Wales the public sector is very large, and the Army forms a large part of that sector. I am worried to learn of proposals to amalgamate the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards with another regiment. Many Welsh people are employed in the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards, which is an excellent regiment. Since the battle of Agincourt, Wales has supplied men and women who have fought loyally for Britain, as I would have been happy to do in the Territorial Army&#8212;I saw no active service. I hope that the Chancellor will bear that in mind when the decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/5">I hope that the Chancellor will forgive me for expressing the hope that he will also look carefully at the carbon tax. I am one of a growing number of people who worry about the fact that there has been no increase in temperature for the past 12 years. It took me a while to get the figures from the relevant Government Department, but Members should have a look at the Met Office website. I worry about imposing on the manufacturing industry a tax that is not being imposed elsewhere in the world. I am not absolutely certain whether global warming is taking place or not, but I am certain that if we start imposing measures that are not imposed elsewhere, all that will happen is that manufacturers will go elsewhere and there will be no overall decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/6">I am coming to the end of my little piece. I want to assure the Chancellor that we are his most loyal supporters, even if we occasionally quibble on certain issues. We are determined to face down the forces of financial chaos on the Opposition Benches. We know that every Labour Government have ended in utter financial catastrophe,</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/7">whether because of Attlee using war loans to build the NHS on the back of American credit, Harold Wilson devaluing the pound and telling us it would stay the same, Jim Callaghan having to go cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund, as the Greeks are now doing, or the previous Prime Minister, himself a former Chancellor, who told us that he had ended boom and bust and then created one of the biggest booms in history, on the back of lax lending regulations and lax immigration controls, and then the biggest bust in history, which we now have to sort out.</p>
	<p pid="a.738.1/8">We know, as do most people in this country, that, whether one is a nation, a company or an individual, it is impossible to go on spending more money than one earns. That is why Government Members will be loyally supporting the Government on the Queen&#8217;s Speech and making sure that we can build a better Britain, built on real growth, not debts that our children will have to pay off at some point in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.739.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" speakername="David Miliband" colnum="739"  time="014:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0002.htm#12051737001250">
	<p pid="a.739.0/1">I want to make two points in this debate. The first is about youth unemployment. I will present some figures showing the rising cost of the Government&#8217;s economic failure. The second is that the neglect in respect of youth unemployment is mirrored by a misguided response to the storms in the eurozone.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/2">I do not think that we need to debate whether youth unemployment is a big problem; it is a massive problem. As the Chancellor and others have said in previous debates, long-term youth unemployment is the greatest danger to not only our economic future, but our social future. Today, according to the Government&#8217;s own figures, 260,000 young people have been unemployed for more than a year, which means long-term unemployment. Another 200,000 have been unemployed for more than six months. The interesting, depressing and worrying thing is that the situation is getting worse. As recently as 2008, 6,000 18 to 24-year-olds had been claiming jobseeker&#8217;s allowance for a year. By April last year that figure had tripled. Over the past year&#8212;just 12 months&#8212;it has tripled again, to 55,000. In my constituency, this time last year there were 15 people who had been claiming jobseeker&#8217;s allowance for over a year, but now the number is 250, which is a 1,500% increase. The total figure for youth unemployment is 1.3 million or 1.4 million, which comes from the labour force survey, but these are JSA claimants, because that is a claimant count figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/3">As for the costs, in February this year I chaired the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations commission on youth unemployment. We costed the levels of youth unemployment on the basis of the figures for the first quarter of 2011, which showed a net present value cost of some &#163;28 billion. I asked the university of Bristol to rerun the figures for the last quarter of 2011, which it has done, and the calculation now stands at &#163;30 billion. In the space of 2011, the net present value cost has gone up by &#163;2 billion. That seems to me to be 2 billion reasons for a greater degree of urgency and effectiveness in Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/4">The Minister responsible for employment says that we should be pleased with stability, but stability in this policy field means that the problem is festering and getting worse. The deputy leader of the Lib Dems, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, said we should celebrate the &#8220;huge</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/5">success&#8221; of Government policy. The wage subsidy that was introduced in April is at best unproven. The majority of jobs under the apprenticeship drive are the result of jobs for the over-25s being rebadged, not new apprenticeships for the under-25s. The expertise in the voluntary sector is being squeezed out by the Work programme. Some 20% of voluntary sector providers have stopped providing under the Work programme. There is a gaping hole in Government policy on transport costs for people to get to interviews, never mind getting to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/6">I make no apology for repeating this very basic fact: the Work programme, which is the Government&#8217;s flagship programme, helps one in 10 of the youth unemployed. Its success rate is 20%, according to the Government&#8217;s own figures. That means that one in 50 of the young unemployed are getting a job as a result of Government interventions. I say to the Chancellor&#8212;I am grateful that he has stayed for the debate&#8212;that there are three steps that he could take now. First, he could require all public contracts over &#163;1 million to offer apprenticeships to young people. In his autumn statement last year he announced infrastructure expenditure, which is a good thing, but where are the apprenticeships to go with it? Secondly, he could bring forward from 2014 money to raise the size of the wage subsidy or the number of young people helped. In 1995, when his predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, tried a wage subsidy, it helped only 6,000 young people. He will have to boost the effort to get take-up. Thirdly, he should bite the bullet and recognise that every study anywhere in the world has shown that for the long-term unemployed only a part-time job guarantee can ensure that one year&#8217;s unemployment does not become three, four or five years&#8217; unemployment.</p>

	<p pid="a.740.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making a compelling case, and I know that he has worked very hard on this matter in the past, but surely he recognises that the best way to solve this is to increase the number of apprenticeships, which the Government are doing, and that his Government encouraged young people to try to aspire to university and many of them, when they did not meet that aspiration, find that deflating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.740.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" speakername="David Miliband" colnum="740"  time="014:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0002.htm#12051737001254">
	<p pid="a.740.3/1">The leading countries of the world for higher education are, first, the United States, which has a 55% participation rate, and, secondly, France, which most people would recognise has having an outstanding higher education system. It has 48% participation. Korea, one of the new countries growing up in the world, has 80% participation in higher education. By the way, Scotland already has over 50% participation in higher education, so I do not believe that somehow English or UK young people are unable to benefit from higher education in the way that people in other countries can.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.3/2">The Robbins report of 1963 said that higher education should be open to anyone with the ability to benefit, and that seems to me to be the right test. For the 50% who do not go on to higher education, we of course need high-quality apprenticeships, but I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40530" name="Mark Spencer">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer)</phrase> that he should work with us to raise the quality of apprenticeships, because too many apprenticeships are at too low a level and are not leading to the kinds of life chances that we want to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.3/3">It is true that our levels of youth unemployment are not the levels of Spain and Greece&#8212;thank God for that &#8212;but in 600 wards in this country one in three young people are not in education, employment or training. It is not the 50% or 55% of the Greeks or the Spanish, but one in three. I do not believe that Europe should be the benchmark for levels of youth unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.3/4">I also say to the Chancellor that Europe cannot be the alibi for the collapse of our economy at home over the past 18 months. If we look at the growth measures since his first spending review in the autumn of 2010, we will see that we are actually doing worse than comparator countries, and I do not just mean Germany. In the 18 months since the 2010 spending review, we have had worse growth than France, Poland, Sweden, Austria and Slovakia. I will compute the Spanish figures announced today, but until those figures were announced we even had lower growth than Spain. Our growth was worse than the EU 27 average, the eurozone average and the G7 average.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.3/5">The Chancellor&#8217;s claim about the problem that the eurozone mess is causing for our economy is actually undermining his own promise to rotate our economy from domestic demand to external demand. The question is: what should we do about that? He says that the lesson is to stay the course. I say that when the external environment changes, we should change course. The storm in Europe is not a reason for us to stick to plan A; it is a reason to shift to plan B. There is a warning in the travails of the eurozone, but not the one that the Government claim there is. Debts are rising today in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland because fiscal policy is exacerbating the downturn in the economic cycle. The Prime Minister said in his speech today that we are &#8220;on track&#8221;, but Conservative austerity is not working at home and collective austerity is not working in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.3/6">I believe that our absolute requirement in the light of the real and serious risks we face is to pitch policy&#8212;fiscal policy, monetary policy, industrial policy and banking policy&#8212;against the tide of the economic cycle. We need to argue to for that abroad and at home. We heard a shift today from the Chancellor about what should happen abroad. We should be embracing President Hollande, not snubbing him. We should be anti-austerity and pro-reform. That is the right position for Europe and the right position for Britain, because there are no islands in the modern economy. It is not ideology; it is maths. And judging by the Gracious Address, it is time for the Government to go back to the classroom.</p>

	<p pid="a.746.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. This is a busy year for tourism in Britain and we must get those aspects right. This is not the first time that those points have been mentioned in this debate, and I think that the Chancellor has taken them on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.1/2">The other thing I would like to point out about the local elections&#8212;this will be the same in future elections&#8212;is the deluge of news that has been thrown at us by the 24-hour news industry. We must think about how the message is managed, not just about the message itself. The Budget is remembered more for Labour&#8217;s sensationalist catchphrases, which have been heard again today, than for its game-changing announcements, such as the increase in the personal allowance, which will affect 24 million people; the largest single rise in pensions ever; and the cuts in corporation tax, which make us the most competitive country in the G8.</p>
	<p pid="a.746.1/3">The latest phrase that Labour is peddling, which has leaked into the media, is &#8220;double-dip recession&#8221;. If I took my son, Alex, to the fairground and we went on a rollercoaster called &#8220;The Double Dip&#8221;, he would be pretty disappointed&#8212;even at the age of 3&#8212;if the second dip was eight times smaller than the first. Labour is being disingenuous with the figures and undermines our economy by constantly peddling that phrase. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I hear Labour Members grumbling, so perhaps we should look at the figures. The Q1 results for 2012 were better than the GDP growth results for 2011, which suggests that the graph is going in the right direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.748.0/1">The key to jobs and growth is wealth creation. We create wealth by digging it up, growing it or making things. Everything else is just moving it around. That is why I welcome the Government&#8217;s focus on real wealth creation, especially manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.748.0/2">Labour has been highly critical of almost everything done by the Government, but it is hard to discern what its programme or vision would be. I suppose we can tell</p>
	<p pid="a.748.0/3">a lot about its vision from what it did when it had its hands on the levers for 13 years. It had 13 long years in which to create the society it wanted, so what did it look like in the end? It loosened bank regulation, and further to help its friends in the City it scrapped the public interest test on takeovers in 2002, meaning that many of our cash-generative businesses are now foreign owned, especially in utilities and infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.748.0/4">Labour decimated manufacturing, taking it from 22% to 11% of the economy, which had knock-on effects for many other sectors, such as logistics. It left Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland in the weakest 10 of the 324 local economic areas. It widened the gap between the north and the south and the rich and the poor, and widened health inequalities. It created a benefits culture in which work did not pay for many people and having children became almost a career option in towns such as Redcar.</p>
	<p pid="a.748.0/5">What about the tax system? Today, we again heard from the Opposition the mantra, &#8220;Tax cuts for millionaires&#8221;. I do not think that friends or even enemies of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> would describe him as left-wing, yet in his alternative Queen&#8217;s Speech the other day he called for a return to the former Prime Minister&#8217;s favoured tax levels&#8212;a top rate of income tax of 40% and capital gains tax at 18%. So how did millionaires fare under Labour? They had a 40% top tax rate until the last month of its 13 years. After the recent cut, it stands at 45%. It levied an 18% rate on capital gains&#8212;a lower rate than their cleaners and drivers would pay on their income. This Government have lifted that to 28%.</p>
	<p pid="a.748.0/6">Under Labour, millionaires could put &#163;250,000 a year into a pension scheme and get tax relief. The cut to &#163;50,000 by this Government has raised &#163;4 billion from the rich. They received child benefit and paid 2.5% less tax on their spending. They could get unlimited taxpayer support for gifts to charities, including family- controlled trusts, public schools such as Eton and, as in the case of Andrew Lloyd Webber, a huge art collection, some of which he rents back cheaply to his own house. Add to that numerous loopholes, and millionaires must want Labour back as fast as possible. Meanwhile, people on the minimum wage were paying &#163;700 a year in tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.752.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend share my concern that Work programme providers are reporting that when they do succeed in getting people into work, it is usually short-term and temporary? If people are cycling round and round the programme, that is certainly not good value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.752.3/1">We have been looking into the issue of whether short-term or part-time work is being provided. When I tried to meet prime providers locally, they would not tell me how many people had been referred to them, how many people they had got into work or how long those people had been in work. The Government claim to be committed to transparency, but any decent assessment of the Work programme is greatly inhibited by such lack of transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.3/2">Finally, I shall speak about Barking and Dagenham as an excellent example of where opportunities exist for the Government to stimulate jobs and growth. We might have lost many Ford jobs over time, but we have massive potential for expansion, with Barking Riverside, Dagenham dock and Barking town centre. The lack of public sector investment in infrastructure and services, however, is the major barrier to achieving growth and jobs. There is potential in Barking Riverside, with planning permission granted by the local council for 11,000 new homes, but at the current rate of building it will take 50 to 60 years before the scheme is completed. If those homes were built, it would stimulate jobs and help to tackle housing need.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.3/3">We cannot get the school that we need in order to assure families who move into the area that their children will have a school place; we cannot get the transport infrastructure we need through the docklands light railway extension, because there is no money there; and we cannot get the Mayor to do anything to stimulate</p>
	<p pid="a.752.3/4">private sector house building. What we need is action, not words. Not a penny of the regional growth fund moneys has come to an area like ours, which needs a huge amount of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.3/5">I am conscious that many Members want to speak, so let me briefly say in conclusion that although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase>, who spoke previously, devoted about half his speech to the previous Government, we are now two years into this Government&#8212;and things have got only worse. During the two years on their watch, living standards for hard-working families in Barking and Dagenham have declined. Since they came into office, people&#8217;s hopes for a better future&#8212;with jobs for their children, homes for their families, and economic growth for their children and grandchildren&#8212;have been smashed.</p>
	<p pid="a.752.3/6">The Queen&#8217;s Speech has nothing to say to the people of Barking and Dagenham. It does nothing for a community where needs are great. It fails the hard-working families of my constituents, it fails the businesses in my borough, and it fails to meet the aspirations and needs of future generations who will make Barking and Dagenham their home.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.753.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40670" speakername="Paul Uppal" colnum="753"  time="014:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001289">
	<p pid="a.753.2/1">That is an excellent point, and it is not made only by Members of Parliament. Hamish McRae, the acclaimed journalist, made it in <i>The Independent </i>during 2003 and 2004. He regularly asked readers what had happened to those golden economic rules&#8212;but that is by the by, and we cannot change it.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/2">I want to raise an issue about which I spoke during the Budget debate. We are right not to allow protectionist rhetoric to creep into our political system, and continually to challenge protectionism abroad. That is crucial to the rebalancing of our economy to change it from an economy that spends on imports to one that earns through exports. I am encouraged to note that British exports rose by &#163;50 billion last year, and that unemployment has fallen by over 45,000 in the first quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/3">I believe that there are two areas in which the Gracious Speech can make a real difference: the creation of the right conditions for private sector investment, and investment in our work force and the work force of tomorrow. Analysts have estimated that UK businesses have cash assets of more than &#163;750 billion, equating to</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/4">nearly half our GDP, and that investing just &#163;20 billion of that in the UK could deliver a 1% increase in growth. We need to ask the difficult question &#8220;Why are these cash-rich institutions not investing domestically?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/5">The answer begins with the boom that preceded the recession. Unlike booms preceding earlier recessions, that boom was financed by public and private debt, which has continued to depress household borrowing and spending. The IMF&#8217;s analysis of advanced economies over the past 30 years concluded that recessions preceded by an unsustainable increase in household debt tended to be more severe and protracted. That is because as long as households pay down debts and increase savings, demand will remain weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/6">One explanation for the weakness of private investment is concern among companies about the future availability of bank finance. They are becoming more reticent in their investment strategies, and are using cash as an insurance against a crisis. The situation is not helped by fears of contagion, or by the lack of liquidity in the banking sector. A solution to the problem would be the creation of a banking system that improved lending and the supply of credit. The introduction of a ring fence around retail banking separating retail banking services&#8212;such as deposit holdings and lending&#8212;from investment would pave the way for a more competitive banking system.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/7">Tellingly, the removal in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated deposit holdings and lending from investment, changed the landscape of banking in America. It allowed larger investment institutions to enter the deposit and loan markets, creating a grab for small banks. In 1999, there were 19 significant large banks in America; today there are four. The picture in the UK is similarly worrying. Although there are smaller banks in the UK and the US, large banks have consolidated their position, creating market dominance. The consolidation of banking on such a scale is bad for businesses and bad for lending. With only a handful of lenders, concern arises about the availability of credit. We often talk about how banks are too big to fail, but rarely do we talk about banks being too big to be effective. Banks can only be described as quasi-public institutions, and will be accountable to the public long after they are sold. They are the engine of any economy, as they provide credit, investment and savings. We need a banking sector that not only serves shareholders, but benefits the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/8">I would also like to discuss how investing in the UK should involve our work force today and the work force of tomorrow. On a personal note, I recently held a jobs fair in Wolverhampton. We had more than 1,500 young people attending and more than 30 employers. One conversation I had on that day still sticks in my mind. It was with a young person from Wolverhampton who said, &#8220;I want to thank you, Mr Uppal, for organising this. You&#8217;ve given me hope.&#8221; When the Leader of the Opposition stands up and says that there is no hope in the Budget or the Queen&#8217;s Speech, the effect is deeply corrosive. I know that the situation in places such as Wolverhampton is challenging, but to dismiss people and just wipe away their dreams so quickly and flippantly is very damaging. Sometimes politicians in this House need to think carefully about the terminology they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/9">We all appreciate that the Opposition have a job to do in holding us to account. However, it is important that we do not respond with knee-jerk reactions, but instead</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/10">always look at the broader picture of what we are doing for the economy and not look to make political capital out of the situation. Investing in the work force of tomorrow means preparing young people for work today. Careers events in schools, inviting local companies to speak at schools, and lessons on interview and presentation skills could all help, and not just in year 11, but early on, when children are starting to think about options and subjects. It is not about getting young people to pick a career early on; it is about them knowing that their options will help them to make the right choices and give them goals for the future. If young people know that maths and science are essential for accessing the type of job they are considering, such subjects will seem more beneficial.</p>
	<p pid="a.753.2/11">Ensuring a skills base for the future to drive Britain&#8217;s industry and manufacturing is evidently important, and recent reports point to a skills gap. It is disappointing to hear companies say that they cannot find the skilled people they need, especially when that is coupled with high unemployment. The west midlands is a great base for manufacturing, and, with the introduction of the i54 site, we can only improve on this. Taking the long-term view on jobs and growth&#8212;helping young people to get the best possible start early on&#8212;can only be beneficial in preventing them from ending up not in work, training or education. Let me finish by saying, for the second time in this Chamber, that when it comes to the difficult decisions, at least those of us on the Government Benches are walking the walk, whereas Opposition Members are just talking the talk.</p>

	<p pid="a.755.2/1">I can tell the hon. Gentleman what I would do: invest to save to grow, and then reap the benefits of that growth through the taxation system.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/2">We warned that the Government&#8217;s policy was wrong, but I do not think any of us predicted just how wrong, just how disastrous its impact would be and just how much more difficult things would become in regions such as the north-east of England. The impacts on the young, as so clearly outlined by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase>, are much greater in regions such as the north-east, yet Government Members seem completely oblivious to what is happening in these regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/3">The UK economy has returned to recession, after shrinking by 0.2% in the first three months of 2012. A sharp fall in construction output is said to be behind the contraction, but it is not the only factor. BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders says that the situation</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/4">&#8220;adds to the picture that the economy is bumping along the bottom&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/5">At Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, the Prime Minister has said the figures were &#8220;very, very disappointing&#8221;&#8212;that is perhaps the understatement of this Parliament. He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/6">&#8220;I do not seek to excuse them, I do not seek to try to explain them away&#8230;there is no complacency at all in this Government in dealing with what is a very tough situation that, frankly, has just got tougher.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-04-25.944"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 April 2012; Vol. 543, c. 944</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/7">He said it was &#8220;painstaking, difficult work&#8221;, but the Government would stick with their plans and do &#8220;everything&#8221; that they &#8220;can&#8221; to generate growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/8">I am surprised that the Prime Minister was disappointed &#8212;what did he expect? The economic outcome of his policies was completely expected by many commentators. The outcome was highly predictable. The Prime Minister needs to recognise that it is his Government who have caused this recession in Britain and that it is his policy that has taken us back into recession. He needs to accept responsibility, and to accept that cutting deeper and deeper is the problem, not the solution and that to continue blindly will only damage our economic prospects yet further.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/9">The Leader of the Opposition hit the nail on the head when he said the economic figures were &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/10">&#8220;this is a recession made by&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/11">the Prime Minister&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/12">&#8220;and the Chancellor in Downing street.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/13">He went on to say that it is their</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/14">&#8220;catastrophic economic policy&#8230;that has landed us back in recession&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-04-25.944"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 April 2012; Vol. 543, c. 944</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/15">The Office for National Statistics has said that the output of production industries decreased by 0.4%; construction decreased by a full 3%; and output of the services sector, which includes retail, increased by only 0.1%, after falling a month earlier. Those figures are slightly worse than many expected, but the fact that the UK is now technically back in recession should not detract from the underlying reality, which is very much as predicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/16">The UK economy has been bumping along the bottom for more than a year and is struggling to gain any momentum. The preliminary figures from the ONS are consistent with the messages coming from official and private data, which say that the UK was once again relying heavily on services and consumption by households. That suggests that the recovery will continue to be weak. Demand is very weak. UK business is sitting on a cash mountain but will not invest because there is no demand in the domestic market. So we very much welcome</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/17">the growth of exports in the car sector, but the fact that such exports are outstripping the domestic market is not really that great news, because the depression of the domestic market is the real problem. We do not have demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/18">The ONS figures also demonstrate clearly that the fall in Government spending has contributed to the particularly large fall in the construction sector. Some Government Members have tried to question the ONS figures and argue that the position is not so bleak, but they are burying their heads in the sand. Joe Grice, chief economic adviser to the ONS, has vigorously defended the figures. He said the construction data were based on a survey of 8,000 companies and had been carefully checked and double-checked.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/19">We are in a very difficult situation. All across Britain and Europe people are rallying to challenge the consensus on austerity, because it is nonsense. The election of the new President in France, who is committed to a policy focused on growth, challenges the failed orthodoxy of austerity; the election and protests in Greece, the protests in Spain and the state elections in North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany last Sunday are shouting to us that a change of direction is absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.2/20">The Government could, if they so chose, focus on growth, but they do not do so. The fact that they choose austerity&#8212;that they choose destruction rather than investment&#8212;is wilful, and it is clearly a political choice. But there is an alternative and I beg them, on behalf of regions such as the north-east and on behalf of my constituents, to change tack&#8212;we need growth.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.757.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40635" speakername="Chris White" colnum="757"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001293">
	<p pid="a.757.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate. All too often, when we talk about the economy we speak in terms of GDP figures, confidence indices and the like, and they are very important, but we should always remember that this is about people&#8217;s lives and aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/2">Employment in Warwick and Leamington has held up well over the past few years. In May 2010, 2,002 people were claiming jobseeker&#8217;s allowance. In March 2012, that had fallen to 1,646. Warwick and Leamington has climbed nearly 100 places and has gone from having the 414th highest level of unemployment among constituencies in the UK to having the 507th. I believe that that is a tribute to the inventiveness of our local businesses, the hard work of our local jobcentres and the determination of local residents to find work. However, while there is reason for optimism. we must also be aware of the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/3">The number of those claiming JSA over the past 12 months has risen from 265 to 310 and although that figure has fluctuated, it makes it clear that we need to continue to build an economy that can create long-term and sustainable jobs, particularly for our young people. It will not be surprising to Members to learn that, as the co-chair of the associate parliamentary manufacturing group, I believe that manufacturing is the key to creating that sustainable labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/4">Although we all agree that we there needs to be economic growth, we do not wish to achieve that through just any type of growth. We should not think of our</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/5">situation merely as a short-term problem that needs short-term solutions, whether that involves stimulating demand or supporting the supply side.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/6">Manufacturing is best placed to support the objective of increased employment for a number of reasons. First, manufacturing is strongest in those areas where private sector employment has been weakest. In the midlands, the north, Scotland and Wales, manufacturing occupies a bigger part of the economy than in London and the south-east. If we can increase manufacturing growth, it is likely that employment gains will be better spread across the country and we will tackle those parts that have traditionally suffered from structural unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/7">Secondly, the nature of manufacturing is changing. It requires greater skills and higher levels of education. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills estimates that by 2017 the percentage of manufacturing jobs in high-end occupations&#8212;mostly degree-level employment&#8212;will rise from 27% today to 37%. That means there will be about as many people in high-end occupations in manufacturing as there will be in low-end occupations.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/8">Thirdly, work within manufacturing is often higher paid than that in services. Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, in the manufacturing sector were &#163;532 compared with &#163;449 in the services sector. Finally, manufacturing jobs have a significant spillover effect into other parts of the economy. They enable the creation of services and other sectors around those jobs and help to provide pillars on which other parts of the economy can build. That increase in manufacturing employment presupposes manufacturing growth, and while I do not have the time to consider that in this speech, it is something to which I hope to return in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/9">If we want to prepare our work force, and particularly our young people, for work in manufacturing, we need to ensure that we take steps now to support that aim. One of the best ways that we can do that is to support apprenticeships. However, we must ensure that they are the advanced and higher levels of apprenticeships so that we meet the increase in the number of higher level positions. According to the latest data, there were 200,300 apprenticeship achievements in 2010-11. However, only 1,000 were higher level apprenticeships. The number of advanced level apprenticeships completed was around 33% of the total and we need to ensure that, as we increase the total number of apprenticeships, that that figure is not diluted.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/10">The best way to support jobs and growth, however, is to give more support to our small and medium-sized manufacturers so that they can take on new employees. More grants should be given to small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturers to train the new staff they hire, particularly those who have been long-term unemployed or who are aged between 18 and 25. Unlike larger businesses, SMEs often are not able to rely on the economies of scale that can reduce training costs. This presents a significant barrier not only to increasing employment but also to growth. I hope that the Government will look at ways of increasing the support we can give to SMEs in this regard with greater financial incentives for those higher-end qualifications that will become more important in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/11">I believe that any long-term improvement in our economy has to be built on manufacturing if it is to be sustainable and create the kind of jobs we need to diversify our labour market. Increasing our manufacturing</p>
	<p pid="a.757.0/12">sector and reskilling our labour force will not be quick or cheap but that does not make it any less necessary. Although we face times of public stringency, we should not defer investment. That will only mean that we have to wait longer for the rebalancing to happen. I am confident that if both sides of the House can work together, support the manufacturing agenda and provide the long-term political buy-in that the industry wants in order to make long-term investment decisions, we can achieve the outcomes that we all want.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.761.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" speakername="Richard Fuller" colnum="761"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001301">
	<p pid="a.761.2/1">Mr Speaker, I draw your attention and that of other Members to the fact that I am an adviser to a venture capital fund and also to my other entries in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/2">I support everything in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that will deal with improving jobs and achieving growth in our country. I hope that is the only partisan point that I shall make in my speech, because I would like to talk a little bit about the use of language, and then advise hon. Members about a very practical way that Members of Parliament can play a role in achieving the goals that we all seek in terms of enhancing jobs and creating growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/3">Let me start, if I may, with language. It is always important, in trying to solve a problem, to use words in the correct way and in ways that make sense, because if we do not do that, of course we will not solve the problem. Sadly, we have a major problem with the language when it comes to jobs and growth, starting with the word &#8220;austerity&#8221;, which has been much used today in a number of speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/4">A dictionary definition of austerity, in its economic context, is:</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/5">&#8220;An economic policy by which a Government reduces the amount of money it spends by a large amount.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/6">In popular discourse that is a description of the coalition Government&#8217;s economic policies. The trouble is that it is not a correct description of the coalition&#8217;s policies. Over the period of this Government, total public spending will increase, not decrease, from &#163;670 billion to &#163;734 billion. If we choose to measure it in terms of public borrowing as a percentage of GDP, the reduction in the UK will be significantly less than that of Greece, Portugal and Ireland. &#8220;Austerity&#8221; is therefore a good catch-phrase, but it is not an accurate way to describe coalition policies. That is compounded by a false choice that is presented to the public: austerity versus growth. I think that is a false and misleading set of alternatives to present, because growth is an objective that all policies seek to achieve, and a better description of the policy alternatives that are being put forward is, on the one hand, growth based on living within our means, and on the other, growth based on borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/7">The BBC, if I may say so, is particularly noteworthy in its use of these false comparisons. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-12">12 May</phrase> Gavin Hewitt, who is the BBC&#8217;s European editor, had a column entitled &#8220;Growth versus austerity&#8221;. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-04">4 May</phrase>, Stephanie Flanders, the BBC&#8217;s economics editor, commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/8">&#8220;It&#8217;s not only Labour politicians that say this. In the debate about the trade-off between austerity and growth&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/9">Yesterday evening, a debate on BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; featured a huge animated set of scales with &#8220;austerity&#8221; on one side trying to be balanced with &#8220;growth&#8221; on the other. That is not the BBC bias of which the Mayor of London has recently spoken, but it is misleading propaganda being put to the British public.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/10">I now turn to a practical idea that all Members of Parliament should consider in their constituencies. I am drawing on some of my experience in Bedford, and on Monday at 3 o&#8217;clock I shall be holding a workshop to describe that in more detail to hon. Members. I looked at the comparative advantages that Bedford had in terms of economics. We do not have much. We do not have a university science park, we do not have a lot of inward investment, and we do not have a big employer, but people have a willingness to invest in and grow local businesses. We are in the process of creating a Bedford business enterprise investment scheme fund&#8212;a policy introduced by the Labour Government and enhanced by this Government. That is an excellent scheme, to encourage people to invest in local businesses. The idea of the fund is to get people to put money into their local business because they want to see them grow. There is a sense of civic duty that motivates people, and the fact that they have idle balances sitting in the banks, earning very low interest rates, is a very good economic incentive for people to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/11">A Member of Parliament can act as a great initiator, champion and cheerleader for this initiative, drawing together a local advisory board of business people to run the fund, seeking out partners for the fund to help to popularise it in the community, and finding new businesses that the fund can invest in. In Bedford, we have set a target of raising &#163;500,000, and we are well on our way to achieving that.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/12">I believe that if other hon. Members engage in that sort of action, it will mean that MPs, who are often criticised for lacking real world experience and being</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/13">out of touch, will be seen in their local communities doing something practical to help people. If we put a network of projects together, we could seek support for this excellent initiative from the regional growth fund so that we have a constellation of local groups across the country where local people come together to support&#8212;commercially&#8212;the growth of local businesses in their community. If people would like to learn more, I shall be happy to explain on Monday at 3 o&#8217;clock in the Thatcher room.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.765.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" speakername="Shabana Mahmood" colnum="765"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001306">
	<p pid="a.765.2/1">Given that the economy is in recession, with the first double dip for 37 years, that long-term unemployment is at its highest since 1996 and that 1 million young people are out of work, it is shocking that the Queen&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/2">Speech contains no measures to deal with those problems and, therefore, utterly fails to address the crisis that millions face.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/3">I wish to focus my remarks on unemployment and, in particular, on youth unemployment and the Government&#8217;s failure to understand that there is an unemployment emergency in our country. We have had a Budget and a Queen&#8217;s Speech that have failed to deliver on jobs and desperately needed economic growth. Not only is that complacent; the Government do not seem to understand that every day they waste in failing to take comprehensive action to get our economy moving again, and our people into work, represents a tragic waste of talent, aspiration and confidence for more and more of our citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/4">My constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the country, at 21.6%, and youth unemployment is at 11.2%&#8212;that is, 2,200 young people looking for work. From March last year to March this year, there was an 84% increase in the number of young jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants out of work for more than six months, and a shocking 91% increase in the number of unemployed young people out of work for one year or longer. Youth unemployment alone is set to cost Birmingham as a city &#163;400 million in the coming decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/5">Behind each statistic is a young person, bruised and battered by their experiences of job hunting under this Government and terrified that they will be part of the lost generation. They tell me that they have worked hard, overcoming difficult social and family circumstances to get qualifications, only to find that none of it matters. It is depressingly normal for young people in my constituency to tell me that they might as well not have bothered, that their effort has been wasted and that they do not know where to turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/6">A climate of fear is already brewing among young people still at school, who despair that their chances of getting on have been kicked away by the cuts to education maintenance allowance and the trebling of tuition fees. They watch their older siblings getting into debt and sending off CV after CV with no luck and no hope, and fear that they will end up in the same boat.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/7">Yet the Government do nothing but create more damage. They cut the future jobs fund, which was making a real difference in my constituency, as soon as they came into office, saying that, at &#163;6,500 per job created, it was simply too expensive. Last week, the National Audit Office told us that the Government&#8217;s flagship regional growth fund will create 41,000 jobs, not the 500,000 that the Government originally claimed. The NAO also said that most of these jobs would have been created in any event and that each of them will cost us &#163;33,000, with a cost, in some cases, of as much as &#163;106,000 per net additional job. So the Government got rid of something that was making a real difference, saying that it was too expensive, and brought in something that is even more expensive but is not making the difference they said it would. That proves that they are not only out of touch and complacent but incompetent.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/8">Unlike Labour&#8217;s proposal for a real jobs guarantee, the Government&#8217;s youth contract does not guarantee a job; it is merely a subsidy to an employer who is hiring a young person that covers only half their wages and does not create a new job. Labour&#8217;s plan for a real jobs guarantee would go much further, guaranteeing a job after 12 months of unemployment and covering the full wages for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/9">In failing to deal with youth unemployment, the Government are storing up problems for the future, because if we allow the young unemployed of today to become a lost generation, they will be the long-term workless of tomorrow. As I have seen in my own constituency, which already suffers from long-term worklessness, getting back into work people who have been out of work for significant periods, or who have never been in work, is a significant challenge that costs huge sums. Problems that have been a generation in the making will take at least that long to fix, so it is far better, on every measure, to stop us getting to that point in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.765.2/10">The young unemployed in my constituency and across our country were looking for a change of course and a sense of hope, but I am afraid that in this Queen&#8217;s Speech there is neither change nor hope&#8212;just a confirmation that this Government do not listen, do not care, and do not have a clue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.773.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" speakername="Steve Rotheram" colnum="773"  time="016:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001317">
	<p pid="a.773.0/1">I was supposed to attend an event hosted by Her Majesty this afternoon on her visit to Liverpool to celebrate her diamond jubilee, but I thought this debate was too important to miss&#8212;even for the Queen. I suspect that she was as unimpressed as were Labour Members on having to deliver a speech last week that was more to do with renewing coalition vows than it was about restoring the economic future of her country, which she serves so dutifully.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/2">Liverpool Walton has seen a 165% rise in youth unemployment in the last 12 months, while total unemployment in the constituency has risen to more than 5,000, making the unemployment count the fifth highest in the country. I know that thousands of people in Walton, and millions around the country, are having conversations about their own lives. What are they thinking? They are thinking: &#8220;Do we have enough money for the weekly shop?&#8221;; &#8220;Do we have enough money to put petrol in the tank?&#8221;; &#8220;Who is going to tell the kids that they can&#8217;t do extra-curricular activities any more because we can&#8217;t afford the weekly subs?&#8221;. Some are even having to explain why their gas and electricity have been cut off.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/3">The Government are simply wrong when what they do results in tearing families apart, providing tax breaks for the very rich and hitting the poorest families hardest. That is the human cost of Tory-Lib Dem policies. In Parliament, however, the Lib Dems still blindly walk through the voting Lobby with their Tory masters.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/4">In the short time available, I would like to challenge a particular Tory-Lib Dem myth&#8212;the one suggesting that the only economic factor that relates to improvement in the living standards of lower-paid workers is raising the income tax threshold. Let me make it absolutely clear that that is not a bad ideal in itself, but here are the facts. I will paint an upbeat picture based on average earnings of &#163;30,000, to which many of my constituents could only ever aspire. For the current financial year, 2012-13, the personal allowance is &#163;8,105. That means that that anyone earning up to &#163;30,000 will be &#163;186 better off this year, making people better off by the grand total of an extra &#163;15.50 in their pockets each month. In the next financial year, the personal allowance will rise to &#163;9,205. That means people will be &#163;346 a year better off, working out at a whopping &#163;28.83 a month in people&#8217;s pockets.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/5">That sounds great, and nobody is arguing that putting more money in pockets of the lower-paid is not a good thing. But&#8212;and there is a big &#8220;but&#8221;&#8212;there is a snag. The Liberal Democrats allowed the Tories to raise VAT to 20%, despite their manifesto pledge and the &#8220;VAT bombshell&#8221; posters that all Opposition Members probably remember. That 2.5% rise is estimated to cost each household with children an average of &#163;450 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/6">The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that by 2015&#8212;even if the tax income threshold has been lifted to &#163;10,000&#8212;the Government&#8217;s tax and benefit reforms, as a package, will result in an average 4.2% reduction in the incomes of families with children during the current Parliament, which means that a couple with children will be &#163;1,250 a year worse off by 2015. That is simply not acceptable, and it is not the full story. An extra &#163;28 a month is clearly no recompense for such a disproportionate hit on families and their living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.773.0/7">The sober eye of history will view this Queen&#8217;s Speech more for what was not in it than for what was in it. There was nothing for the young unemployed, nothing for families struggling to get by, and nothing for the record number of women who are waiting and wanting to work. There was not even a single mention of the word &#8220;jobs&#8221;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.776.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40589" speakername="Kate Green" colnum="776"  time="016:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001321">
	<p pid="a.776.0/1">I want to make a few remarks about unemployment. Despite the modest fall in unemployment yesterday, we still have the highest rate of long-term unemployment since 1996, with 650,000 people in part-time work because they cannot get full-time work and 2.625 million people unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/2">I want to highlight two groups of losers in the labour market for whom there were absolutely no policies in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. The first group are women. Whereas male joblessness increased by 5.4% over the past year, the increase in female joblessness was nearly double that, at 9%. The second group are people from ethnic minorities. White British women and men are more likely to be employed than those from any ethnic minority. A report by Elevation Networks in March revealed that more than half of young black men are unemployed and that the youth unemployment rate for black people has increased at nearly twice the rate among white 16 to 24-year-olds. There was nothing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to deal with those inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/3">When I asked the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" name="Chris Grayling">the right hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> in February what steps were being taken to address black youth unemployment, he answered that &#8220;Get Britain Working measures&#8221; operated &#8220;irrespective of ethnicity&#8221;. There was nothing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to address the structural drivers of black youth unemployment; no attention paid to, for example, guaranteed jobs for long-term unemployed young people, as recommended by the Riots Communities and Victims Panel; no ethnic monitoring of the Work programme or apprenticeships; no targets for black unemployment; and no mentoring of young black people. Indeed, despite the Prime Minister promising before the general election that there would be a massive programme of mentoring, nothing has materialised.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/4">As for women, the Government have, I am pleased to say, recognised the importance of affordable and reliable child care, although I am alarmed by reports in the <i>Daily Mail</i> this week that Ministers think that the way to boost child care supply is to strip back regulation. Reducing bureaucracy is all very well, but deregulation that dilutes quality and compromises children&#8217;s well-being is simply unacceptable. The Netherlands saw a steady deterioration in the quality of child care as a result of introducing measures similar to those that we understand the Government might be contemplating. Indeed, the Dutch Government have now decided to reverse their deregulation policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/5">Finally, let me talk about something that actually was mentioned in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, albeit only cursorily: the Government&#8217;s proposal to introduce measures to promote flexible parental leave. We have yet to see the details of exactly what will be on offer, but I warn Ministers to be cautious. An alliance of organisations, including Maternity Action, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the National Childbirth Trust, Bliss, the Child Poverty Action Group and Citizens Advice, have warned of the need to protect adequate protected leave for women to secure the health and well-being of new mothers and their babies, and to select measures that actually ensure that a share of parental leave is taken up by fathers. Policies that have been shown to be effective in doing</p>
	<p pid="a.776.0/6">that include the meaningful replacement of a father&#8217;s lost income, and protecting leave for fathers, rather than eating into mothers&#8217; leave. We need to ensure that the modern workplaces consultation proposals, which seem not to address those kinds of concerns, are carefully re-thought. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. There is much more that I would like to say, but I will pass on to colleagues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.777.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40251" speakername="Jessica Lee" colnum="777"  time="016:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051737001322">
	<p pid="a.777.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40589" name="Kate Green">the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green)</phrase> for her contribution. Although we do not perhaps agree on policy points, I always find her contributions in this Chamber thoughtful and well-researched.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/2">Having a broader view about how we tackle the issue of jobs and growth in this country for the longer term is crucial in getting this country back on its feet and continuing to do well. We need to weave together a number of different policy areas, and have a long-term vision and a commitment by the Government to achieve that. Various themes are involved: infrastructure, apprenticeships and training, and help at a very local level for small and medium-sized enterprises. All that has to be achieved against a backdrop of a strong deficit reduction programme, which the Government must stick to .</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/3">I see infrastructure as an important theme in allowing and helping people to be mobile, to reach new job opportunities and to reach their goals, be it through training or work. In my constituency we have a long-term project, which is now being considered by the Secretary of State for Transport, to reopen the train station in Ilkeston. We are pleased that the Government are considering the project in great depth, because Ilkeston used to have three stations until the 1960s, and it now has none. We are trying to get one reopened, which will give many young people many more job opportunities, as they will be able to get to Derby, Nottingham and further afield. In many ways, my constituency is well placed. It is right in the heart of the country, with the M1 running through it and the East Midlands airport nearby. However, it is the smaller projects that add to and feed into the wider infrastructure of the country that will really help.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/4">I was able to participate in national apprenticeship week, as I am sure many hon. Members did. The personal experience of meeting young apprentices, such as Martin at Derwent Analytics, means that we see how young people are progressing and benefiting from such schemes, but I am not being complacent. Nobody in this House is being complacent about the challenges involved in tackling long-term youth unemployment. We must support those young people who are making progress. I applaud what the Government are doing on apprenticeships: 177,000 new places in the past year is no mean feat. My area has a proud, long history of apprenticeships, and as the local MP I will continue to champion their worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/5">I also wish to discuss&#8212;briefly, given the time&#8212;local help for small and medium-sized enterprises. Although I welcome the changes in the local planning regulations, this is also about local enterprise partnerships. Erewash is lucky because its partnership is extremely strong. It</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/6">particularly supports start-up businesses and helps with training and mentoring. Let me provide other examples. Prostart, in my constituency, also helps young people with training and with the encouragement and support they need to move on in the world. Women entrepreneurs are also doing well in my constituency: I was delighted to be there when Kirith Richards recently opened her photography suite and I wish her well for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.777.0/7">Time is against me so I will leave it there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.780.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="780"  time="016:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0003.htm#12051756001834">
	<p pid="a.780.0/1">This Queen&#8217;s Speech, like previous Budgets, was an opportunity for the coalition to promote growth, but the scale of the jobs and growth challenge facing the UK is matched&#8212;thanks to this Chancellor directly and to this Government&#8212;only by the scale of paralysis and inaction. Over the previous six quarters, four of which, including the past two, have been negative, the UK economy has contracted by 0.2%. This is a double-dip of the Chancellor&#8217;s own making. He has told us that he was acting in our best interests and that, &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together; honest Guv&#8217;nor, I share your pain.&#8221; He told us he that he was pursuing his austerity policies to prevent us from becoming like Greece, which was sheer baloney. Instead, he has made our growth more like that of Spain, which has just followed us into recession. Just to illustrate this point further and to show that there was and remains an alternative I point out that under the Labour chancellorship of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, the UK economy grew by 3.2% between quarter 3 of 2009 and quarter 3 of 2010. Under the current Chancellor, the Bank of England&#8217;s forecast for growth has again been slashed to 0.8% from 1.25% in 2012 and reduced further for the following year, and many economists are saying that even that is wildly over-optimistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/2">The recession is now stretching out to historic proportions, trying to match the extent of the great depression, which lasted for more than 12 quarters. The facts are stark: output is now 4.3% below the level at the beginning of the recession in 2008 and the UK&#8217;s position on the world stage has contributed to that, because it has been pitiful. In the UK, it was made clear that everything must be sacrificed to the god of deficit reduction&#8212;jobs, growth, and creating confidence in the economy. The process continues, somewhat inevitably now, as the Prime Minister and the Chancellor daily</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/3">talk up the chances of meltdown in Greece and across the EU in order to show how helpless little old UK can do nothing in the face of those events.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/4">The crisis in Greece and the eurozone has become the stock excuse for this Government to do nothing. &#8220;Sorry Miss, the big black dog ran off with my homework&#8221; is now &#8220;Sorry Miss, the big black Greek storm clouds ran off with my jobs and my growth strategy. It wasn&#8217;t my fault.&#8221; That is not good enough. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have to listen. They have to take lessons. They must do better.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/5">It is true that the solutions lie at international level, but that is a reason for taking action, not for hiding from the storm. For the last two years, instead of sitting on the sidelines like Johnny no mates, we should have been leading by example, encouraging policies of growth as well as policies of deficit reduction. What is tragic is that the UK, which has previously been in so many ways a progressive force in the EU and globally, has now become a showcase for austerity and zero growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/6">Let us be clear: if Labour had won the election, we would have had to deal with the deficit, but we would have done it in a more measured way, promoting growth, not just pain. We could not have escaped the pain, but it would have been distributed more fairly, not dumped on the backs of children, the disabled, women, the poor and hard-pressed middle-income families. Because our approach would have prioritised growth, we would even have got the deficit down, rather than increasing it as the coalition Government have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.780.0/7">The Government do not get it. They are way out of touch. They never really believed we were all in it together&#8212;certainly not bankers and Cabinet Ministers. In areas where jobs could have been created, deficit reduction has blinded them to all sense. The Queen&#8217;s Speech has done nothing to change that. This is government for the privileged and the very wealthy few, not for the hard-pressed and the wealth-creating many.</p>

	<p pid="a.785.0/1">I am grateful to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40273" name="Ann McKechin">the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin)</phrase>. She mentioned an industrial policy, which we are of course looking at, but the problem she must face is that Lord Mandelson&#8217;s industrial policy came far too late. The north-west experienced 13 years in which her Government allowed the gap between north and south to increase, and it increased according to any survey chosen. Ultimately, the only investment that came into the north-west was rapid public sector investment in either construction&#8212;the so-called affordable housing that turned out to be one or two-bedroom flats, not real houses for families&#8212;or an ever-expanding regional development agency that could do nothing about the expansion of London and the south-east, when compared against the contribution of the north-west or any other region. I am pleased that this Government, through part of the Queen&#8217;s Speech, is consolidating the missing links and dealing with the failure to invest in infrastructure over 13 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.788.0/1">Last week&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech was my first as an MP. Although nobody does pomp and pageantry better than we do, I was deeply disappointed with its content: lots of style but no substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/2">When this Government came into office two years ago, we were in economic recovery. Since then, we have been bumbling along the bottom with very little growth,</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/3">and now we are back in recession again. This is not due to the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s; it is due to the mismanagement of the economy by the current Downing street incumbents. Yesterday, the Bank of England yet again had to downgrade forecasts for economic growth, from 1.2% to 0.8%, and the outlook for inflation is well above the 2% target.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/4">Yet this not the experience of every other country. The US, which was at the centre of the global crash in 2008, started to recover, like us, in 2009-10, and it is continuing to recover. Similarly, the rest of the G7 is performing better than we are. Our economic performance is one of the worst in the G7, with Italy coming up just behind us. Brazil has now overtaken us as the sixth largest economy. The austerity measures that this Government have introduced are clearly not working.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/5">The impact on unemployment in the public and private sectors is already being felt. Last year, the public sector lost 276,000 jobs. Some have estimated that the figure will be as high as 700,000 by 2015. In Oldham, &#163;24 million has been cut from next year&#8217;s council budget, meaning 400 jobs losses. That is not the end of it. My local hospital trust, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, recently announced a statutory consultation on a further 160 redundancies. It has to find savings of &#163;45 million this year. That comes on top of 600 posts that have already been lost. In spite of the Government&#8217;s reassurances that jobs will be created in the private sector, large and small businesses alike are closing, including BAE Systems in Chadderton, Warburtons Bakery in Shaw, Long&#8217;s Plumbing and, of course, Remploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/6">Although I welcome yesterday&#8217;s unemployment figures that show a reduction in the previous quarter, I am afraid that the trend in long-term unemployment is upwards, as we have heard. In Oldham, more than 8,000 people are out of work across the borough, with 11 people chasing every job. The number of women out of work is the highest since 1995. There has been a 25% increase in long-term unemployment among the over-50s. In my constituency, the number of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants has increased by 20% since June and doubled since 2006. Young people in my constituency have been particularly badly hit, with a 288% increase in long-term unemployment since last year. Worryingly, young black and Asian men are disproportionately affected, with 56% and 23% respectively being unemployed. Those figures have doubled since 2008, so we should be very worried about that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/7">What was there in the Queen&#8217;s Speech for those people? Absolutely nothing. At the Select Committee on Work and Pensions yesterday, I was profoundly disappointed by the apathy and complacency about what is going on and about how it can be addressed. The youth contract is not geared towards focusing on these problems and only quick fixes have been introduced. There are inequalities not only between different population groups, but on a geographical basis. The urban heartlands of Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and parts of London are most affected. The Government&#8217;s talk about fairness is just that&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.796.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" speakername="Jonathan Ashworth" colnum="796"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0004.htm#12051756001855">
	<p pid="a.796.1/1">I shall make only a few brief points.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/2">I thought that the Queen&#8217;s Speech was extraordinarily flimsy, given that it emanated from a party that is in its second year in government and has been out of power for 13 years. When we compare it with the greatest Queen&#8217;s Speeches of the Labour Government in their second year and, indeed, those of the Thatcher Government in their second year, it is apparent to us that the present Government are running out of steam after only two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/3">There was nothing about jobs in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase> demonstrated so eloquently in his speech, the Work programme is entirely unsatisfactory. It cannot possibly deal with the youth unemployment crisis. The Queen&#8217;s Speech should have been seen as an opportunity to put right the mistakes that the Chancellor had made in his Budget. I am glad that he has dug himself out of the hole of the churches tax, but I wish he would dig himself out of the hole of the pasty tax and the caravan tax, and, indeed, his &#163;40,000 giveaway. I believe that the Prime Minister&#8217;s former speechwriter Ian Birrell described it as</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/4">&#8220;a missile into six years of Tory modernisation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/5">I could not have put it better myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/6">Unemployment in Leicester South has increased over the past 12 months. Although I welcome the drops in unemployment announced yesterday, I must tell Ministers that in Leicester South it fell not by 1%, but by one. If the Government do not produce measures to deal with the youth unemployment crisis soon, I fear for the future of many of the communities we represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/7">The Chancellor expected growth of 2.5% this year, but we are now in a double-dip recession. Some of the contributions from Government Members were rather complacent on that front. Many people warned the Chancellor that a fiscal consolidation of this scale and pace, along with a collapse in demand and consumption, would lead to a recession. Indeed, the Business Secretary, when he was in opposition, gave him that very warning before the general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/8">What are we given in the Queen&#8217;s Speech? We are given what appear to be proposals for the further erosion of workers&#8217; rights. I must tell the Chancellor that downward pressure on workers&#8217; rights will not lead to the growth in the economy that he wants. What a turnaround this is for the Business Secretary. He started his career co-authoring &#8220;The Red Paper on Scotland&#8221; with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, but it appears that in the twilight of his career he will become the Twickenham strangler of rights at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/9">Government Members have talked about trade and exports. I agree that the patterns of international trade are changing. As many Members will know, the city of Leicester, which I represent, has deep and extensive links with India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and I want us to build on those links and to trade further. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40530" name="Mark Spencer">The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer)</phrase> referred to food manufacturing, in which we in Leicester have expertise. We export British Asian food to Europe, to the middle east and, indeed, to India. However, I must tell Government Members that although the reports that I hear of UK Trade &amp; Investment have improved, they are patchy at times.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/10">I think that we need more support for export finance in Leicester. I think that it would be greatly to the advantage of the Business Secretary, when he and the Prime Minister go on trade missions to India, to take with him not the great and the good, but some of the small business people from Leicester who understand how to enter challenging markets in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.1/11">Let me finish by simply saying that we have a Government who promised us growth and jobs; what they are delivering is recession and unemployment.</p>

	<p pid="a.799.1/1">I will not give way, because there are so many points to respond to.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/2">We know that this recession was not made by British business. It is not down to the weather, the snow or the royal wedding; it is down to the failed policy of this Government. Despite the good news we had on unemployment this week&#8212;there was a glimmer of hope&#8212;Britain&#8217;s jobs crisis has now gone on for too long. We now have more people working part time or becoming self-employed, because they will do anything to make ends meet. Long-term unemployment is surging towards the 1 million mark, the number of people out of work for two years is up to 500,000, 100,000 more people are signing on than last year, redundancies are up by 50,000, and vacancies are down by more than 10,000. Families all over Britain are facing a disaster, because of the failed policies of this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/3">This afternoon we heard those stories from all over Britain. The point was made forcefully by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase>, and it was a story repeated by my hon. Friends the Members for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell), for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden) and for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth). We heard in the debate this afternoon that we need growth and demand&#8212;a point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams), for Gateshead (Ian Mearns), for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell) and for East Lothian. We heard how higher unemployment is hitting some communities and some regions harder than ever&#8212;that was the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" name="Alison McGovern">the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern)</phrase>. It is hitting ethnic minorities harder than ever&#8212;that was the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) and for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams). It is now hitting young people harder&#8212;that was the message we heard from hon. Members from all parts of the House, and it was a point made with particular force by my hon.

	<p pid="a.799.1/4">That is why what we needed in the last Budget and in the Queen&#8217;s Speech was not excuses, but action. We needed action on bank lending&#8212;that was the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds East (Mr Mudie) and for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark), and by the hon. Members for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay), for Northampton South (Mr Binley) and for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb). We needed action on infrastructure spending, too&#8212;that point was made with great force by my right hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-17a.800.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="800"  time="017:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0004.htm#12051756001862">
	<p pid="a.800.1/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks for a party that has now put up borrowing by &#163;150 billion more than projected. Does he know why? It is in large part because the benefits bill is not being capped by this Government&#8212;the benefits bill is going through the roof. It is set to be &#163;25 billion higher than was projected by the end of this Parliament, with the cost of unemployment benefit set to be up by &#163;5 billion and the cost of housing benefit set to be up by &#163;6 billion by the end of this Parliament. I really do not know how he has the temerity to say what he has just said, given that it is his Government who are putting up debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/2">The problem is that this Government have not learned the lesson that the way to bring the benefits bill down is by getting people into jobs&#8212;that is where this Government are failing. It is no wonder the people all across Britain are saying that this Prime Minister and this Chancellor have no idea how ordinary people live. The Prime Minister is riding on horses with editors of newspapers who are charged with perverting the course of justice while our young people cannot even afford a bus fare to college. We heard this afternoon just how much that bill has now become in a powerful speech from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase>. We heard that youth unemployment will cost our country &#163;30 billion over the years to come. When are this Government going to heed that lesson?</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/3">When will they look at the hit now being taken by working parents, who are struggling with child care? These parents are now losing &#163;500 this year. No wonder 32,000 women have already had to give up work this year because they cannot afford the child care. We should look at what this Budget means for working parents&#8212;a point made with some eloquence by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury and by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>. Such is the incompetence and such is the incoherence that families in this country are now better off on benefits than they are in a job&#8212;what a catastrophic failure of policy and what a catastrophic failure by this Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/4">Look at what these proposals mean for savers&#8212;people doing the right thing. Alongside the granny tax, the Government tried to sneak out in the Budget small print another &#163;900 cut for pensioners by getting rid of the savings credit. Look at what the proposals mean for workers with disabilities. Some 11 million people in this country have disabilities. Disability Rights UK says that 25,000 people with disabilities have had to give up work this year because their support and help are being cut away from them. This Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is now administering reform of the incapacity benefit system with all the finesse of border control at Heathrow airport. It is now taking people up to 11 months to get a hearing and then, when they reach that tribunal, half the decisions are being overturned. That is not a result that he can be proud of.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/5">Worst of all is the treatment being handed out to workers at Remploy. These are workers indirectly employed by the Secretary of State himself. Worst of all&#8212;worse than anything I have heard over the past few months&#8212;are the reported comments that he made to Remploy workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/6">Apparently he told them that they, &#8220;are not doing any work at all. Just making cups of coffee.&#8221; That is not compassionate conservatism; it is the conservatism of contempt. The Secretary of State should apologise to those workers this afternoon. When he should have been launching a war on poverty, he has launched a war on decency.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/7">This Government have no idea how these young people, these parents, these working mothers and these workers with disabilities are now living. They are failing on jobs, they are failing on growth, they are out of touch, out of their depth and out of steam. We need a change of direction and Labour&#8217;s motion today offers that. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.801.0/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" name="Liam Byrne">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase> back from a potential sojourn in Birmingham as mayor&#8212;his announcement that he wanted to stand was so powerful that Birmingham, on the spot, rejected the whole idea of having a mayor. I have got to know him well over the past couple of years and he has been heavily involved in designing the policy framework for the Opposition. He talked about part-time work and, as a result of his leader&#8217;s decision, he will experience it himself. I am sorry about that, because I am sure that he would have done a very good job had he been allowed to continue&#8212;I certainly suspect that he would have done better than some of his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/2">Today is about the Queen&#8217;s Speech, and I want to welcome a number of Bills: the Crime and Courts Bill, the children and families Bill, the draft care and support Bill to modernise the care system, and, importantly, a pensions Bill to provide once and for all a decent single-tier state pension to reward those who save. Let me say a few words about that matter and in tribute to the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>. He and I have worked very hard together and I hope that when we publish the White Paper both the House and the country will see that we are proposing a genuine and serious reform that should improve the quality of retirement for everybody in the future. We will reform the state pension system, creating a fair, simple and sustainable foundation for private saving. The main benefits of the Bill will be that it will enable individuals to take responsibility for meeting their retirement aspirations in the context of increasing longevity and create an affordable and sustainable pension system for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/3">Let me respond to a few of the comments made by my hon. Members on both sides of the House. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">The right hon. Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase>, who I see in his place, made an elegant speech, as ever, in which he referred to a number of different issues. In particular, he mentioned youth unemployment, and I want to ensure that we establish the baseline on that point. The trouble was that the previous Government gerrymandered the figures on youth unemployment. When somebody had been unemployed for six months, they put them on one of their programmes&#8212;the future jobs fund or whatever&#8212;and took them off the unemployment register. They were not put back on to</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/4">the register until they fell out of that programme&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/5" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/6" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/7" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/8">Members might want to hear this. If we add together the figures, we see that the total number of claimants aged 18 to 24 on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or other forms of temporary support is lower this month than it was in May 2010. Under the previous Government, during a period of growth, youth unemployment rose every year from 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.802.0/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. He appears to be unaware of a briefing that his own Department gave to the Select Committee on Work and Pensions yesterday, which exposed the lack of rigidity in the figures. Apparently, the correct figure shows that in March 2010 the number of people who were taken off benefit on a training allowance was 18,000. It has come down to 4,000, but will he accept that that does not explain the rise in youth unemployment?</p>

	<p pid="a.816.2/1">I am extremely grateful personally to Mr Speaker for affording me the opportunity to secure this debate and to raise the case of the disappearance of my constituent, Mr John Lawton. John&#8217;s wife Lynda, his son Steve and daughter-in-law Rachel are in the Gallery this evening, at what is a deeply worrying time for them. I pay tribute to the dignity and commitment they have shown throughout the period of some five to six weeks since Mr Lawton disappeared in Greece. They have spent much of the past five to six weeks in Greece and are back in the UK while the search for John continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/2">John Lawton went missing on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-08">8 April</phrase>&#8212;Easter Sunday&#8212;while participating in the Taygetos marathon in Greece. The race started at 8.30 am. The organisers have confirmed that John passed through checkpoint 4 at 1.17 pm, which was about halfway round the course, 21 km from the start of the race at the start of the Viros gorge, but he never reached checkpoint 5, at 26 km&#8212;or at least he was never checked in there. Some new information in that connection has just come to light, and I will refer to it later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/3">Since being made aware of John&#8217;s disappearance, I have been assisting the family and trying to maintain awareness. I heard about the matter within three days and made immediate contact with the Foreign Office to call for assistance. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40326" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly)</phrase>, also made immediate representations to the Foreign Office in his capacity as the constituency MP of Mr Lawton&#8217;s son, Steven. My hon. Friend spoke with the Foreign Office no fewer than three times on Easter Monday, and his intervention contributed to the provision of a helicopter search for about an hour on the following day. The family are appreciative of my hon. Friend&#8217;s active interest in the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/4">I first raised the matter in the House at my earliest opportunity, at Foreign Office questions on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-17">17 April</phrase>, when the Minister for Europe kindly confirmed in response that he had spoken with our ambassador in Athens, called for further representations to be made at the highest level of the Greek Government, and made arrangements for a member of the consular team in Greece to visit the Lawton family to discuss their concerns and what support they required. At that time, one key thing that the family wanted&#8212;they still want it on an ongoing basis&#8212;was a well-resourced, professionally co-ordinated search directed at the highest possible level by the Greek authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/5">I wish to put on the record my thanks to the Minister and the staff in his office for their ongoing assistance. I thank him specifically for taking the time to speak directly with Steven Lawton a few weeks ago and for his continuing agreement to meet representatives of the Lawton family at any stage. It is also important to thank British officials in Greece who have continued to press the Greek authorities on behalf of the family. Dialogue with the police and the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs remains crucial. It is particularly important</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/6">because at present, as the family told me a few minutes ago, the search in the area is no longer continuing, other than through the occasional tourist who might see the posters placed in the area advertising John&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/7">Over the past five or six weeks, I have received dozens of e-mails not only from constituents but from people across the country who know John, Lynda, Steve and other family members, and I have been struck by the affection and respect in which they are held. One typical e-mail read: John</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/8">&#8220;is a man who worked with people with learning, physical difficulties and challenging behaviour&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/9">whom</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/10">&#8220;he never gave up on. His wife, Lynda, is the nicest person you could meet and they are totally devoted to each other&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/11">John and Lynda married when they were 18-years-old and have been happily married for 42 years. The family tell me that there is no reason John would have voluntarily disappeared. They have lived in the local area, in my constituency, for almost all their married live, and their two children, Steve and Sara, attended school in Sandbach. The local community has rallied to support the family, and yellow ribbons have been worn by many people to show their concern following John&#8217;s disappearance. The local media, too, have been extremely supportive. I spoke on BBC Radio Stoke most recently this morning about the matter, and the <i>Crew</i> <i>e</i> <i> Chronicle</i> and the <i>Sandbach Chronicle </i>have made this a headline issue for several weeks, which has been crucial, not least in helping to raise funds to support the search for John.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/12">John Lawton is a popular and active member Sandbach Striders running group, three of whose members have been out to Greece to help in the search. I have been particularly impressed by the lengths to which members of the group have gone to support the family. Six members&#8212;husband and wife duo, Jason and Jo Bulley, Perry Wyatt, Terry Coppenhall, Robert Kettle and Steve Treweeks&#8212;participated in the London marathon to raise funds for volunteers to go out to Greece as part of the search team. A JustGiving page, in the name of John Lawton, has also been set up by Missing Abroad. The last time I visited the site, 300 people had generously donated more than &#163;13,500. That money, however, has all but been spent on the cost of the 15 Cheshire search and rescue team volunteers who also went out to Greece to help with the search, and on other expenses. I hope that the recently revised target of &#163;25,000 for these costs can be surpassed as soon as possible and that publicity generated, not least as a result of this debate, will help in that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/13">In the immediate aftermath of his disappearance being reported, the Greek authorities initiated a search conducted and led mainly by the local Gaia volunteer rescue group. People from the local villages were extremely helpful, closing their businesses and searching throughout their Easter holidays. The search was joined at various points by the police, fire service, search dogs, local mountain rescue teams and the Greek Red Cross. The official search, however, was called off by the Greek authorities about two and a half weeks ago. The family have asked me to express their gratitude that it lasted 20 days, but since then only local volunteers, family members and volunteers from Cheshire have been on the ground looking for John. The 15-man team from</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/14">the Cheshire search and rescue group returned just a day or so ago, and the family are now particularly keen that I emphasise that there is now no ongoing, active, professional search, and have asked that the Minister ask the Greek authorities that the search be reconvened, not least because information has come to light that leads us to believe that not all the relevant areas have been searched.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/15">The family have engaged privately commissioned UK investigators to review the evidence that has been amassed in respect of John&#8217;s disappearance. A detailed timeline chart has been prepared and was sent to the Minister earlier this week. The chart is an analysis based on interviews conducted by UK investigators directly with Greek and British witnesses. The police investigation into John&#8217;s disappearance has confirmed that there were eight athletes behind John at the fourth checkpoint, but there has been no formal indication that they were all interviewed and asked whether they saw him between the fourth and fifth checkpoints.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/16">An English witness who lives near the fifth checkpoint on the course apparently approached Gaia to say that she recalled seeing John running past her home close to the fifth checkpoint at about 2 pm. A gel packet, of the English brand that John used and certainly had with him at the time, was found on the course just before the fifth checkpoint. It was found some four weeks ago, but it has not yet been established whether it belonged to him. The family is awaiting the results of DNA tests from the Greek authorities. Any help the Minister can provide to help to secure those results promptly would be appreciated. Two other such gel packets have been found recently by the Cheshire search and rescue team.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/17">All this information suggests that John might have progressed beyond the main area covered by the initial search, and the family is therefore requesting the Greek authorities to recommence their search efforts and to focus on the area highlighted by the new evidence. The initial search might have been conducted in the wrong area, and it is for that reason that the voluntary groups out in Greece have been searching the area between checkpoints 4 and 5 far more extensively. However, additional professional help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/18">John Lawton is not the first Congleton constituent to disappear in Greece. The Minister might be aware of the case of Steven Cook, a Liverpool university student and former Sandbach school pupil who disappeared in the resort of Malia in Crete on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>. I know that Steven&#8217;s parents have campaigned tirelessly for more information following their son&#8217;s disappearance, and the advice and support that they have offered to the Lawton family over the past few weeks have been greatly appreciated, especially as John&#8217;s disappearance must bring back memories of the extremely worrying time during the aftermath of Steven&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/19">I have highlighted a very sad case tonight. It is a case that continues to cause the Lawton family an immense amount of worry and distress. I know that the Foreign Office has been as active as possible, here in London and out in Greece, but I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm what further action can be taken at this time to continue and extend the search for John. Will he also tell me how the discussions with the Greek authorities are progressing, and will progress in the future, and what further steps will be taken to ensure that John&#8217;s family receive the ongoing support</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/20">that they require from all the relevant authorities, here and abroad, and in particular, to ensure the re-engagement of the official search?</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/21">I would also be grateful if the Minister could use this opportunity to clarify what assistance the Government can give through the Foreign Office to families who find themselves in a similar predicament. Could he, for example, review the literature that is provided by our embassies to families who find themselves with a missing relative abroad to ensure that it is clear? The disappearance of a loved one at any time is a tremendously distressing situation to have to contend with, but it is made much worse when it happens overseas. I am sure that it would be of considerable help to receive some guidance from the Minister in this respect. This would be of benefit not only to the families who find themselves in this predicament but to Members of Parliament who want to advise their constituents as well and as expeditiously as possible in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.2/22">I want to close as I began, by paying tribute to the immensely dignified and committed way in which the whole Lawton family&#8212;not only Lynda and Steven, but Lynda and John&#8217;s daughter Sara, who has also been supporting them&#8212;have behaved, and to the commitment that the whole community in my constituency has shown in this situation.</p>
