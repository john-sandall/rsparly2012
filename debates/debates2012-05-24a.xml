We need to tackle that, and I am sorry that the last Government failed to do so. Indeed, they produced six new regulations on every working day. But is the hon. Gentleman correct in saying that we need to think about the calibre of management of small businesses? Yes. Bad regulation and red tape need to go, but we need to think about the wider issue as well, I shall certainly take that from the hon. Gentleman, as he asked me to do.</p>

I know that that is something that all parties have wanted to do. However, the Secretary of State will note, and we will note, your admonishment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1266.4/1">It is very important to maintain confidence in the British economy, and people can take confidence from the fact that employment is up, and that inflation is down so their living standards are protected.

Those are the reasons why we are confident in the British economy.</p>

The revised GDP estimate for the first quarter of this year, far from being revised up, as some expected, has just been revised down. With the country in a double-dip recession created by this Government, 50 businesses going under every single year, and over 2.6 million people out of work, this shambolic Government have been squabbling over a report produced by a millionaire Tory donor that suggests that all would be well were it not for people&#8217;s rights at work.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1285.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="1285"  time="011:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0001.htm#12052457001170">
	<p pid="a.1285.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for his statement. Twenty four years ago today, Parliament passed legislation introducing section 28 into law. It was a nasty, discriminatory law that caused a lot of bullying and misery. After a fierce three-year battle, in the teeth of Tory opposition, we repealed it in government. Last week, I asked the right hon. Gentleman about the Government&#8217;s position on equal marriage. In reply, he spoke eloquently about the importance of equality, but by an unfortunate oversight&#8212;I am sure it was an oversight&#8212;he omitted to answer my question. This morning, the Government&#8217;s position has become clear. Lacking the courage of the Prime Minister&#8217;s convictions and threatened with a growing revolt in the Cabinet, they have decided to grant those opposed to equal marriage a free vote, meaning that the Government&#8217;s flagship policy on equal rights will become law only with Labour support. Will he arrange for the Home Secretary to make a statement to say when legislation will be introduced, because there was no sign of it in the Queen&#8217;s Speech?</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/2">The Prime Minister was no doubt delighted to receive from Steve Hilton his leaving gift, a copy of the Beecroft report, which is the worst attack on workplace protection in a generation. His gratitude was clearly short lived, because only a few days later No. 10 was briefing <i>The Daily </i> <i>Telegraph</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/3">&#8220;No one really has any idea what went on with this report, it was very much Steve Hilton&#8217;s project. The whole thing is a bit dodgy and we wish it had never happened&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/4">Liberal Democrat and Conservative Ministers have spent the last few days fighting over it, and the shambles has continued with the report&#8217;s author attacking the Business Secretary by calling him a &#8220;socialist&#8221;. Only a hedge fund boss and Tory donor could call someone who voted for a tax cut for the richest 1% a socialist. Where was the Business Secretary today, by the way? He was in Berlin. Will the Leader of the House prevent Secretaries of State from being out of the country when there are</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/5">questions to answer in the House? It is perfectly reasonable for them to arrange their trips at other times of the week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/6">Yesterday, the Government published the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. The Leader of the House announced a moment ago that the Bill would be the first thing we considered on our return. The Bill contains a small section on employment law. Will he reassure the House that the Government will not bring forward amendments to the Bill to implement more of the Beecroft report?</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/7">The senior Liberal Democrat Back-Bencher, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, introduced a petition this week opposing the Government&#8217;s decision to impose a caravan tax. I thought I must have missed him in the Division Lobby when the Opposition tried to prevent the Government from introducing this unfair tax, but according to <i>Hansard</i> he voted for it. The Liberal Democrats voted for the pasty tax and pretended to oppose it in their constituencies, and now they campaign against the caravan tax, which they voted for. Is there any bit of this bungled Budget that they are prepared to support in their constituencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/8">These Liberal Democrat tactics are clearly infectious, because four Conservative Back Benchers have started doing the same thing: they have introduced petitions opposing the caravan tax that they voted for. Will the right hon. Gentleman find time for a statement to remind his Back Benchers that if they want to campaign in their constituencies against Government policy, they should at least vote against it when the matter is before this House? People are beginning to notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/9">Ministers have recently been complaining that the country has not been working hard enough. We have to wonder what planet they are on. Families up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet, worried about job security, worried about how they will afford rising fuel and food bills, and angry that the Government are doing nothing to help. Can the Leader of the House confirm that when Ministers complain that the country needs to work harder, they are in fact thinking about the Prime Minister? We learn this week that his aides say that he spends</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/10">&#8220;a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/11">We have a Chancellor who is trying to do two jobs&#8212;both badly&#8212;while the Prime Minister fills his time slicing fruit on his iPad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285.3/12">On a day when the Office for National Statistics has announced that the double-dip recession is worse than we thought, Liberal Democrats and Conservative Ministers are slugging it out in public. The Conservative party is fighting among itself on equal marriage and House of Lords reform. Government Back Benchers are denouncing in their constituencies the measures that they voted for in Parliament. Does the Leader of the House not think that instead of losing his temper and ranting at the Dispatch Box, the Prime Minister should just get a grip?</p>

	<p pid="a.1286.0/1">I wait patiently for questions about next week&#8217;s business, but they are pretty hard to find. Let me go through the issues that the hon. Lady touched on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/2">The Government are consulting on equal marriage, which is something that the Labour party did not consult on, or indeed do anything about, when it was in government for 13 years. The consultation is under way;</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/3">it has not finished. Along with other issues that involve matters of conscience, it seems to me perfectly proper that this matter should be subject to a free vote on this side of the House, and that is what we plan to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/4">We had a statement on Beecroft on Monday. We have also had BIS questions, a large chunk of which were all about Beecroft, and I am not sure that the Leader of the House can usefully add to what has already been said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/5">The hon. Lady asked about the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, which has been published. The Bill, which will be debated when we come back, sets out the Government&#8217;s proposals on the subject. Of course the Government will listen to the House if it proposes amendments to the Bill. For her to ask me to rule out any Government amendments is to say that we should be denied the opportunity of listening to the views of the House, including those of Opposition Members, so of course we will be in listening mode on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/6">On VAT on static caravans, the Chancellor announced a number of measures in the Budget to address anomalies and loopholes. We extended the consultation period on the measures to <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-18">18 May</phrase>, and we are now considering the consultation responses, including the petitions that hon. Members have presented to the House. The Government will respond on the issue of static caravans later in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/7">On not supporting in the Division Lobbies that which Members may have supported in early-day motions, I would just remind the hon. Lady of the incident with the post office closures in the last Parliament. We tabled a motion that very closely resembled early-day motions that had been signed by Government Members, and then, miraculously, they were not in the Lobby when the Division was called. I therefore think she needs to be cautious about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286.0/8">As for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#8217;s temper, I am amazed that the hon. Lady has the audacity to raise that, in the light of the somewhat irrational behaviour at times of the previous Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.1290.1/1">Modesty forbids me from endorsing the claim that I am the most famous cyclist in the House. I enjoy seeing many of my hon. Friends and many Opposition Members at the bicycle shed after the last Division of an evening. I applaud my hon. Friend, who I believe is in touch with the all-party cycling group, which, under the guidance of its chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> has decided to endorse the Yorkshire bid. As a Government Minister, I have to be a little cautious in case a rival bid should come forward from another county&#8212;possibly Hampshire. Although the Government are neutral, I commend my hon. Friend&#8217;s initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.1303.1/1">Today is an important day for the UK solar sector. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-09">9 February</phrase>, I published a consultation setting out proposals to ensure the future of the feed-in tariffs scheme for solar PV. These wide-ranging reforms will make it a bigger scheme, providing better value to consumers and more certainty to both industry and government. Today, I am announcing the Government&#8217;s final decisions on those proposals and explaining how we are working in partnership with the industry to make the feed-in tariffs scheme just one part of an even bigger plan to ensure a strong framework for the ambitious roll-out of low-cost, high-impact solar installations across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/2">In recent weeks, we have received a lot of helpful input from a wide range of stakeholders, including businesses and consumers, who have entered into really constructive engagement with the Government in a spirit of genuine partnership and a determination on all sides to get the proposals right. I believe that the resulting improvements and reforms to the FITs scheme will now put it on a predictable and sustainable long-term footing for householders, communities, business and the UK solar industry, so that industry and consumers alike can face the future with real confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/3">We have listened carefully to what industry has shared with us. Our reforms and assumptions have been informed by further independent expert analysis of both the technology and installation costs, which remain on an encouraging cost path; and we have been monitoring closely the very latest trends in deployment. As a result of that careful listening, we have decided that the continuing cost reductions in PV technology and installation justify further changes in tariffs, but that, to help the sector through the period of transition, the changes should be made on <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-01">1 August</phrase>, rather than <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-01">1 July</phrase> as we had originally proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-01">1 August</phrase>, we will raise the export tariff for new solar PV installations from 3.2p to 4.5p better to reflect the real value of solar electricity exported to the grid. Generation tariffs will continue to be uprated in line with the retail price index, following strong support from consumers and industry. To bring PV into line with the tariffs applied to other feed-in tariff technologies, the lifetime for which tariffs are paid to new installations from <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-01">1 August</phrase> will be reduced from 25 years to 20. However, that change has been taken into account when setting generation tariffs, so that the overall rate of return is not affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/5">We set out in our document a range of options for reducing tariffs further. but, having listened carefully to the sector, I am announcing today that the generation tariffs for nearly all installations will be at or above the highest of the options we consulted on in February. The exception is the smallest domestic installations rate, for which we had proposed a range of tariffs from 13.6p to 16.5p, and for which we have decided on a tariff of 16p. The new tariff reflects the particularly strong performance of the industry in bringing down costs in that crucial part of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/6">The tariff for multiple installations will now be set at 90% of the individual tariffs, up from 80%. Those tariffs are designed to give a return on investment of more</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/7">than 6% for most typical, well sited installations, and up to 8% for larger bands. The mechanism for setting future tariffs that I am publishing today is slightly different from the one we proposed in February. In particular, it should smooth out deployment more evenly and provide greater budgetary control and predictability for investors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/8">TLC is what I have always set out to provide: transparency, longevity and certainty. I believe that that is exactly what our new framework will deliver. As we go forward, predictable and transparent tariff changes might be made every three months, at the beginning of November, February, May and August. The amount of the tariff cut, if any, will be announced at least two months in advance and&#8212;crucially&#8212;it will depend not on a political judgment, as it did in the old system introduced by the previous Government, but on uptake in the previous three months; so if uptake in May to July is very low, we will announce before the end of August that there will be no tariff cut in November. The default reduction, if deployment is within the published thresholds, will be 3.5%. If uptake is higher than that, the cut will be increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/9">All the changes are designed to set a clear, predictable framework within which the solar industry can flourish, but we need to go beyond that to unblock any barriers to the development of solar PV in the UK and to continue the drive towards widespread cost-effective deployment. That is why the Department of Energy and Climate Change is developing, in partnership with the industry, an enterprise strategy for solar, reflecting the serious and significant future that solar PV now has in the UK energy economy, and helping to realise the coalition&#8217;s vision of a far more radically decentralised energy sector than we inherited. As part of that, I expect solar to feature prominently in the renewable energy road map when we update it later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/10">More is needed, however. The huge strides made so far in bringing solar manufacturing costs down need now to be repeated in the installation end of the business. That is why I have now set up a PV cost reduction taskforce, involving leaders from the solar industry, and will be working proactively with it on the challenge of bringing down the installation costs of UK solar PV. We will also continue our regular dialogue with the PV manufacturers&#8217; group, which played a key role in helping us to understand the cost drivers and trends in this dynamic industry, and with our FITs PV round table group, which I will meet again early next week. Those groups will play a vital role in helping us to monitor developments in the solar industry and to support future decision making, ensuring that UK solar can reach its cost-effective potential. In addition, we will continue to invest in science and innovation. The work of Research Councils UK supports early stage solar PV development, with a commitment to spend about &#163;40 million on researching solar technologies between now and 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/11">Finally, I welcome a particularly encouraging sign of new leadership and confidence in the UK solar industry: the proposals to establish a national solar centre. That exciting and far-reaching plan to set up a national solar centre in Cornwall is being developed by Cornwall council and the Building Research Establishment. That is great news for the south-west and further evidence of the solar industry&#8217;s coming of age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.1/12">The solar sector has come through a difficult period of adjustment but now, thanks to our major reforms and the coalition&#8217;s continuing support, it can face the future with genuine confidence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1305.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40372" speakername="Luciana Berger" colnum="1305"  time="012:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0002.htm#12052457001263">
	<p pid="a.1305.0/1">I thank the Minister for his statement. Unfortunately his office sent the statement and the 39-page consultation response document just over half an hour ago, so I have not been able to study it in detail. I was, however, able to get details of what was in the statement from someone at Friends at the Earth, who had been briefed by his Department before I received a copy. Perhaps the Minister can share with us why that was possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/2">The chaotic manner in which the statement came about tells its own story about the Government&#8217;s approach to feed-in tariffs. No one disputes the need to bring down the FIT level in an orderly fashion, but the Government&#8217;s chaotic mismanagement of that process threatens a growing industry and undermines investment across the entire low-carbon sector. This debacle, a mess created by this Minister, began more than eight months ago and has so far cost the Department more than &#163;80,000 in legal fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/3">Once again, the Government are sneaking out changes to feed-in tariffs on the day before a recess. They did it in February and they have done it again today. The Minister threw a lot of smoke and mirrors about why he is moving the July deadline, but the truth is that he is changing the deadline not because he wants to but because he has to. Will he confirm that the Government have missed the deadline by which they were legally required to provide notice to Parliament for the next round of cuts to have come into force by <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-01">1 July</phrase>? Is not his incompetence the real reason why he has been forced to come to the House today?</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/4">On the detail of his statement, will the Minister tell us whether, despite the changes announced today, the number of installations will still drop by a third this year? I welcome the announcement that tariffs will continue to be linked to the retail price index, but what estimate has he made of the effect on take-up of the reduction from 25 to 20-year payments? If take-up remains low, what measures will he introduce to boost demand to meet his ambition of 22 GW by 2020?</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/5">The Minister says he wishes to set up a PV cost reduction taskforce. What mechanisms will he put in place to ensure that a cut in the cost of installation does not lead to an increase in rogue solar installers? If demand does exceed the deployment level set by his Department, what will be the additional cut to the tariff above the 3.5% he has announced today? He says that he listens to the industry, but if he really listened he would not have dragged it through the courts, trying to impose devastating cuts that went too far and too fast. He lost that battle. This entire process has been a long list of blunders by the Minister and his Department. Will he now agree to independent oversight of the feed-in tariff to prevent future mishandling of the scheme?</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/6">In February, the Minister said that his cuts would</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/7">&#8220;deliver for far more people&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-02-09.473"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 February 2012; Vol. 540, c. 473</phrase>.]&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/8">and more than under Labour, but the number of installations has collapsed since his last cuts came into force in April. He said that his Government would deliver 22 GW of solar power by 2020, but at the current rate of installation, that target will be missed by more than 100 years. He also said that he would put the industry on a sustainable footing, but a devastated 6,000 people have lost their job as a direct result of his actions last summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1305.0/9">The Government&#8217;s rushed changes to feed-in tariffs go too far and too fast, hitting squeezed families who are trying to protect themselves from soaring energy bills and paralysing an entire industry. Instead of supporting businesses, he put thousands of jobs at risk and left the sector living on its nerves. Today was a chance to end the uncertainty and lay out a clear path to 2020, but the Minister has failed to set out his plan to deliver his 22 GW by 2020. He said that he wants to deliver TLC&#8212;I have noted the phrase transparency, longevity and certainty on a number of occasions&#8212;but all we got today was more of the same: more chaos, more confusion and more cuts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1306.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" speakername="Gregory Barker" colnum="1306"  time="012:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0002.htm#12052457001264">
	<p pid="a.1306.0/1">I am very sorry that the Labour party is stuck in this rut of doom-mongering, carping and sapping the confidence of the industry. Everyone I have spoken to, right across the board, wants to re-inject a sense of confidence and energy into this vital sector, but rather than rally around the sector, Labour Members are determined to sap confidence even more and send chaotic messages to people who are trying to make a living&#8212;all for short-term, petty political gain. Rather than look at the long term, they are just playing politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.0/2">As for sneaking out an announcement on the last day before recess, it may be that this is a half-day, slacker&#8217;s shift for Opposition Members, but for coalition Members it is a full working day. Obviously, the hon. Lady sees today as part of the holidays, but I assure her that we are at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.0/3">Let me be absolutely clear: we have not moved the date by one or two days, or one or two weeks. If that was what we wanted to do, we could have done it, but we wanted to send a very clear message to the industry that we are listening. We have moved the date from <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-01">1 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-01">1 August</phrase> in a very planned, deliberate and thoughtful way, and I think the industry will be glad of that change. The bottom line is that had we wanted to meet the <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-01">1 July</phrase> deadline, we would have had to lay the measures sooner, but we did not want to meet the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-01">1 July</phrase>. The deadline is now to have the measures in place to allow the cuts to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-01">1 August</phrase>. I thought that even the Opposition would have been capable of working that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.0/4">The hon. Lady asked about ambitions for installation. That we continue to build deployment is key for a sustainable UK industry. I can tell her what our impact assessment will say and what the coalition&#8217;s clear ambition and expectation is. Under the totally unfit-for-purpose scheme produced by the current Leader of the Opposition as one of his last acts in government, about 250,000 solar panels would have been put on to roofs. I can say to the hon. Lady that, thanks to our reforms, there will be more than 1 million solar panels on British homes by the next general election. I am really proud of that. Delivery will be far more cost-effective than it would</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.0/5">have been under Labour&#8217;s scheme, and unlike that scheme, ours will be delivered on a long-term basis, free from political interference, and it will be much more transparent, sustainable and predictable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.0/6">On the 2020 ambition, the hon. Lady is absolutely right that solar is a transformational technology. Developments around the world now lead us to be confident that we can deliver on a very high ambition, and mine is 22 GW by the end of the decade&#8212;but that depends absolutely on our driving down costs. How and where we do that and the point at which we do it will be critical. That is why I am determined to work more closely with the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1312.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of a pardon for Alan Turing, the celebrated wartime code breaker and father of the modern computer. My reason is twofold. First, Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing did much of his famous work, is in my constituency. Secondly &#8211;&#8211;a more timely reason&#8211;&#8211;<phrase class="date" code="2012-06-23">23 June</phrase> will be the centenary of his birth. The centenary should be a celebration of his achievements and what he did for this country. There is also the issue of whether he should be pardoned for the so-called crime of which he was convicted in 1952, which led directly to his death two years later at the age of 41.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/2">Before turning to that, let me remind the House of the debt this country, and indeed the whole world, owes this man. He was a brilliant mathematician and his role at Bletchley Park in deciphering the messages encrypted by the German Enigma machine was vital. He led a team that designed a machine, known as a bombe, that decoded the Germans&#8217; military messages. So vital was that information to the allied campaign that, without it, the war might have lasted much longer and, indeed, its outcome might have been very different. How many lives of allied servicemen, residents of cities in this country bombed by the luftwaffe and people transported to Nazi extermination camps were saved by his work? It is no exaggeration to say that we probably owe our very liberty to his work and his genius.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/3">It is also fair to say that he is the father of modern computing. He produced the first academic papers on artificial intelligence, which paved the way for modern computers. Who knows where technology would be today without his pioneering work? I hope that Parliament will be able to mark his centenary next month in some way. I am applying to the Backbench Business Committee for a debate close to that date so that we can pay proper tribute to his work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/4">There is a more controversial matter that I would like to raise today and ask the Government to have a serious think about. In 1952, Alan Turing, by then working in Manchester, met and fell in love with a young man and had a sexual relationship with him. That affair came to the attention of the police. Homosexual acts were illegal at the time and he was charged and convicted for gross indecency. Upon conviction, he was given the choice between imprisonment and probation conditional upon his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido&#8212;effectively chemical castration. He chose the latter option. His security clearance was withdrawn, meaning that he could no longer work for GCHQ. It is now well documented that the consequences of that treatment led directly to him taking his own life by biting into a cyanide-laced apple in 1954. In my view, the state effectively killed him. What a disgraceful way to treat a hero of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/5">In our thankfully more enlightened times, his so-called crime is now perfectly legal. Welcome steps have been taken to apologise for how he was treated. The former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/6">and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), rightly issued an official apology on behalf of the Government. I referred to that action in my maiden speech and I am happy to repeat my praise for it, but more could be done. There is a campaign and an e-petition to grant Alan Turing a formal pardon, and to date nearly 34,000 people have signed it. Both local newspapers in my constituency, the</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/7" class="italic">Milton Keynes </p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/8" class="italic">Citizen </p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/10" class="italic">MK News</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/11">, are backing the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/12">So far, the Government have been reluctant to accede to this request. I raised the issue with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House during business questions and he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/13">&#8220;I understand that an application for a royal prerogative of mercy was made on the basis that the offence should not have existed but, sadly, one cannot give a royal prerogative on those grounds. I will have another look at this, but I am not sure that there is a case for intervention by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Justice. That could happen only if fresh evidence came to light to show that the conviction should not have taken place. The argument that the offence should not have existed in the first place is not normally a ground for prerogative.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-03-08.1018"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 March 2012; Vol. 541, c. 1018</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/14">I understand that argument but ask the Government to look again. If a pardon in the traditional sense is not legally feasible, is there some other way that this could be done? After all, it is an area of law on which the Government have recently taken welcome action. Under the recently passed Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, a person who has been convicted, or received a caution for, an offence under sections 12 or 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 or corresponding earlier Acts can apply to have their conviction or caution disregarded. Those were the same &#8220;offences&#8221; for which Alan Turing was convicted. If a full pardon is not possible, could not the disregard be applied posthumously for Alan Turing?</p>
	<p pid="a.1312.2/15">My call today is simply for the Government to take a fresh look at the matter and explore all possibilities. We owe so much to this great man. The coming centenary of his birth affords us a great opportunity to put right the wrong that was done to him, and I urge the Government to look carefully at the matter.</p>

BAE Systems is a major employer not only in Samlesbury, Warton, Brough and other areas, but throughout Lancashire and the north-west because of its supply chain. The aerospace industry is huge and there would be a colossal impact if it were slowly to move away from the north-west. I have deep concerns that BAE Systems has a large investment in Texas, and the British Government do not seem as committed as I would like them to be to the projects that BAE Systems is currently engaged in.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/3">I welcome the recent announcement of 175 jobs. It did not escape my attention that those jobs arrived in this country with our current employment laws, not those proposed in the Beecroft report. The Government</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/4">are keen to trumpet jobs in the car industry and other industries such as aerospace, so the absence of the hiring and firing proposed by Beecroft does not seem to have had an adverse impact on those 175 jobs. However, the reality is that those jobs are set against a background of thousands of job losses. I understand that BAE Systems is trying to mitigate that and reduce the number of job losses to several hundreds. How successful it will be remains to be seen, particularly given the doubts about the joint strike fighter and the orders with Lockheed Martin in America. It could well be that thousands of jobs are lost and those 175 jobs for the Hawk, although welcome, simply will not reverse the cataclysmic decline in employment and skills in the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/5">I want to raise some questions about the Hawk deal. Will there be a successor to the Hawk? It only has a certain lifespan, so where is the investment in, and the forward thinking on, the next trainer plane? What are we doing about Britain&#8217;s interests? Replacing the Hawk requires a long lead-in time, and, if we do not start considering our aerospace future, we might run out of products that we can sell to the world, with exports such as the Hawk to Saudi Arabia becoming a distant memory in 10 or 15 years&#8217; time. That really worries me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/6">A lot of BAE Systems&#8217; hopes in the north-west seem to be pinned on unmanned aerial vehicles&#8212;UAVs&#8212;and, in particular, on the Taranis, so I should like the Deputy Leader of the House to state the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure not only that they are manufactured in Britain and bought and endorsed by the British Government, but that we have an active industrial policy to push UAVs. They are clearly the future and a chance for BAE Systems to maintain production in the north-west, but, if the Taranis and UAV programmes should decline, fall or move elsewhere, they would begin the collapse of military aerospace in the region. I have deep concerns about the issue, so I should welcome his comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/7">All that is set against the chaos of Lancashire&#8217;s enterprise zone. Last July, the Business Secretary declined to offer the region an enterprise zone; then Sky News ran a breaking story that 3,000 jobs were to be lost in Warton and Samlesbury; and within 24 hours the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a U-turn on the enterprise zone decision, stating that it would go ahead&#8212;based on 24-hour rolling news.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/8">It was a chaotic situation that should not have been allowed to arise, particularly when it involved such a large employer that adds so much to the GDP of the area and of the country in terms of defence, and adds to skills and to the supply chain for other manufacturers and areas in the region. I have really deep concerns about that, and I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House can put them to bed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/9">On the implications of that situation, I note that youth unemployment in my constituency has risen to 232% of its 2010 figure, and I have real concerns, because, if we lose aerospace, what impact will that have? The availability of work in the area appears to be declining, and I wonder where the future lies for my constituents, while we are in a double-dip recession and while economic policies are not working nationwide and, in particular, in the north. There is a north-south divide, and we are seeing the impact of that, but it is not just the young people in my constituency who are suffering, but the long-term unemployed, who are becoming the even longer-term unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/10">The third issue that I draw to the attention of the Deputy Leader of the House is the number of people who are applying for the few vacancies that exist. Increasingly, people are forced to go for part-time work, rather than full-time, and they are struggling to make ends meet. Those concerns of mine and of my constituents reflect the economic downturn that of the past couple of years under, I am afraid, his Government, and they are impacting severely on my constituents, who are deeply worried. It should come as no surprise to him that, in my local authority area and in neighbouring areas, people at polling stations only two weeks ago rejected the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties and voted Labour. He must be deeply concerned about that, because he cannot say that the voters are wrong; he must listen to them and to their concerns. Having raised the issue of youth and long-term unemployment, I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House takes it as seriously as I do and does not just say, &#8220;It will all be all right in a couple of years&#8217; time.&#8221; These are chronic issues, the backbone of which is the industrial base in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/11">Another concern is the country&#8217;s nuclear programme, which does not particularly affect my sub-region, the east of the county, but does affect the west and the supply chain. There are huge doubts about the programme, and, given that the west is home to some large nuclear industry employers, that could have a grave impact on one of this country&#8217;s great manufacturing areas. The Deputy Leader of the House must be concerned about those issues, and I hope he will address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/12">The bottom line is the increasing number of people turning up at food banks in Lancashire, particularly in the east of the county. In the corridor from Chorley to Hyndburn, people are turning up, desperate, unable to feed themselves and reliant on handouts from supermarkets and other generous donors, and that is a real concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/13">Today, growth figures were revised down, from a contraction of 0.2% to 0.3%, and, if the Deputy Leader of the House looks at that geographically, he will find the south-east flatlining while the north-west and my area are taking a disproportionate hit, with the north-west contracting not by 0.3% but possibly by double or treble that, thereby giving rise to the figures I cited earlier on youth unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/14">The chaos and confusion around BAE Systems is worrying, and it concerns many of the electorate in our area. When they see headlines involving the Navy buying ships from Korea, they find it deeply disconcerting. We have naval production in Barrow, in the north-west and throughout the country, and when people see such things they question what precisely the Government are doing in their economic strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/15">More locally, when we look at procurement, we think of Lancashire constabulary. Why are they not buying British cars? They recently bought cars from Korea, but how can that possibly be right? How is that rebalancing the economy? How on earth can Britain be a manufacturing country when just down the road in Lancashire there are Vauxhalls on offer to the police authority, which has gone and bought Korean cars? For all the talk of rebalancing the economy, it is either hypocritical or just lazy when we are not actively engaging with public services&#8212;these are public services&#8212;that procure foreign vehicles. It is not just vehicles, but ships and other things too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/16">The car industry in the north-west and the north in general is another major manufacturing employer, and we have heard the Government fanfare on cars, but, when Ministers say that we now have a balance of trade surplus, I think, &#8220;You probably have.&#8221; Because if the public services are procuring cars from overseas, not domestically, that is one way to achieve a trade surplus&#8212;not by increasing exports, but by diminishing domestic demand. That is what has happened with Lancashire constabulary and with other public services, and in all that there is a whiff of hypocrisy, with the Government taking their eye off the ball.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/17">There is a national crisis in adult social care, but I shall reflect on the situation in Lancashire, which really needs some attention. Older people in Lancashire have been badly let down by the county council and by Lancashire&#8217;s Conservatives. I have raised the issue before, but, for example, our local Conservatives have raised the daily charge for day centre care from &#163;5 to &#163;30, and they are going to double it to &#163;60. Some people might believe that this is the market and people should pay the cost, but let me explain the consequences. If 20 people are required to keep a day care open, but only 10 people can afford such extortionate charges so it closes, everybody loses. Then the danger is that there will be no market because it will have collapsed. Day care providers tell me that these increased charges mean that they are thinking about closing their businesses. The day centres will be shut and people will be unable to access such services&#8212;even those who can afford them. All the community links and personal links that our ageing population have built up will be lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/18">For people who go to these centres, particularly those who are vulnerable and may have dementia, it is very confusing to be asked or forced to go to a different place to meet other people and to have to pay these charges. They are vulnerable people who should not be pushed around like this. Greater consideration should be given to the unintended knock-on consequences of the ridiculous charges that have been brought about by the austerity policy of the coalition parties, whose members do not fully appreciate the consequences. No wonder the voters look at these fees and think, &#8220;This is not the austerity that we want. It is undermining civil society and undermining my family. There must be other ways we can deal with this.&#8221; The electorate are unhappy, hence the election results.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/19">The problem does not end there. There has been a wholesale attack on elderly people in Lancashire, who have been really let down by the Conservatives. The removal of funding for community transport means that people sometimes cannot get to day care centres. Extra charges are being added. People are not just paying &#163;30 but another &#163;3 or &#163;4 for community transport and, on top of that, &#163;6 or &#163;7 for food. In total, elderly people are having to pay about &#163;41 a day just to turn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/20">It is not just the provision of day care centres that people are upset about and where there is a crisis in Lancashire. In addition, the local authority is failing to consider the private provision of day care. Day after day, I speak to people in my surgery who are deeply concerned about the inadequacy of the home help service that they receive and the lack of safeguards. We have seen the crisis that surrounds respite care and permanent residential care, and the scandals that have occurred in those settings. However, something that</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/21">never gets talked about is the fact that home helps who go to the properties of vulnerable elderly people, who often have dementia and are unable to act as consumers, provide what they and their relatives feel to be an inadequate, and in some cases appalling, service. That scandal needs to be looked at. I am sure that the majority of people feel that the current system is unsatisfactory and that there are no safeguards. People are starting late, clocking off early and providing a poor service because they know that their customer is 95 years old, has dementia, is infirm, and cannot move. That is generally the situation, and it is not right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/22">The situation is not helped by the removal of some care packages by Lancashire county council. For instance, it removed the allowances for shopping and laundry that were given to the infirm and those with dementia who cannot do their own shopping and washing. We now have elderly people trapped in their own homes who are able to receive some help, but not allowed to receive help with shopping and laundry. It seems that an 89-year-old with dementia will be advised that they must use the internet or phone up to get Asda to do a home delivery, or ask their neighbour or relatives to come round and do their laundry for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/23">This is all adding to the deep concern about adult social care for our elderly and vulnerable people in Lancashire. If the people of Lancashire feel they are being let down by the Conservatives, I am sure that they will go to the polls with that in mind, and at the next election we will see the same as what happened in the previous election. The Deputy Leader of the House needs to be deeply concerned about the fact that this situation affects many people who may change their vote because of it. I am very worried about staffing and reduced access in adult social care, and I would be grateful if he commented on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/24">There are deep concerns across the country about Sure Start&#8212;not about its being cut but its being undermined by stealth. In Lancashire, we have experienced reduced hours, reduced staff, and a cut in outreach services. In some instances, there is anecdotal evidence of a bucket being passed around so that people can put in donations to keep Sure Start going. It is not satisfactory for Ministers to stand at the Dispatch Box and say that there is no reduction in the number of buildings where Sure Start services are being delivered when in fact those services are being reduced and undermined and parents are being put off going there because they are asked for handouts when they do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1322.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and understand his point. Unfortunately, when we run out of land on which we can build houses, we have to</p>
	<p pid="a.1322.1/2">look elsewhere. This is not about nimbyism; it is about the fact that my constituency only has enough brownfield land for about 3,000 houses. The target has been accepted, and the only other place to build is on the green belt. He mentions homelessness, and it is a valid point, but the number of people on the waiting list in Broxtowe is 2,254. As he will understand, that list often indicates the level of interest in finding houses that the council may have available. The number of homeless people recorded in my constituency is probably fewer than 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322.1/3">I do not want to trouble the House any longer, but people in my constituency are concerned that their voices will yet again not be heard. Only this week, I was publicly admonished by the planning officer in an e-mail that was unfortunately copied to Labour councillors and my predecessor. The e-mail told me that my advice to my constituents was in some way inaccurate, but it was not at all. I have come to this place to achieve a number of things, but perhaps most importantly I am here to represent my constituents, whether they voted for me or not. I intend to continue to do that. In so doing, I speak out in favour of protecting the green belt in my constituency, whether from open-cast mining or from a housing target that my borough council did not have to accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322.1/4">I hope the Deputy Leader of the House will forgive me if I am not here at the end of the debate. I will be quiet very soon, so that others can speak. I hope that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will make the Government&#8217;s policy quite clear yet again. I hope he will say that local authorities are under a duty to determine their own housing targets and make their own plans, and to protect their green belt from development at almost all costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1323.0/1">It was a great temptation to go off down the M4 about an hour ago, but I wanted the opportunity to speak today since we are going to be away for two weeks. Many changes will take place in the middle east in that period, so I could not go without voicing my concern. If I take more than 10 minutes, perhaps you will signal vigorously in my direction, Mr Deputy Speaker. I also hope the Hammersmith flyover will soon be back to normal&#8212;it is ridiculous that it has taken so many months to repair. Those who use that artery to the M4 have to allow an extra hour in our journey just to get over it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/2">I have spoken about Bahrain a number of times. The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs is currently preparing a report on the Arab spring. For some countries, spring came earlier, but things have been more difficult in others. In countries where the spring is in its early stages, such as Bahrain, there are concerns about the lack of progress. Many of the recommendations made by the commission set up by the King are yet to be implemented. Human Rights Watch said in a new report released earlier this month that Bahrain&#8217;s human rights situation remains critical in the wake of the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 2011, with clashes between police and protesters continuing. There are also reports of deaths from beatings and the excessive use of teargas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/3">The King established that so-called independent inquiry&#8212;I have high regard for some on the inquiry, such as Sir Nigel Rodley&#8212;but unfortunately, very few</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/4">of its recommendations have been implemented, such as holding senior officials accountable for crimes. Recommendations on torture have also not been implemented, and there has been a failure to free protesters who were jailed for exercising their right to free expression and peaceful assembly. Bahraini police continue to beat and torture detainees, including minors, despite the report&#8217;s recommendations and public commitments by the heads of Bahrain to end torture and police impunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/5">Nabeel Rajab, a Bahraini human rights activist and head of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, a non-governmental organisation, who led protests against authorities in the gulf kingdom by calling for democratic change, was arrested on his return from a trip abroad on charges of</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/6">&#8220;participating illegal assembly and calling others to join&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/7">and &#8220;insulting a statutory body&#8221; via Twitter. He has been granted bail but is still being held in anticipation of other charges being made against him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/8">The court of cassation, the highest judicial body in that gulf Arab state, shifted the case of 21 men who were convicted in a military court to a civilian court and freed one lesser known prisoner. Seven of the 21 are abroad or in hiding, but the court ruled that the other men would remain in jail, including Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who is being fed intravenously in a military hospital after nearly three months on hunger strike. We assume that that is still the case, because we have heard nothing further about him recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/9">More than a year after the men were arrested, the Bahraini authorities have produced no evidence that the jailed leaders were doing anything but exercising their basic human rights. The Bahrain Government have made it clear that they still view the case as serious. One of the al-Khalifa family&#8212;the chief Government spokesman &#8212;alleged that the 21 men</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/10">&#8220;called for the overthrow of the monarchy using violent means&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/11">He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/12">&#8220;In due course new evidence will be presented in a civilian court to prove that point.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/13">A similar retrial process is under way in a civilian court for 20 medical professionals&#8212;doctors, nurses and dentists&#8212;who were convicted of anti-state activities by a military-led tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/14">After signalling that Saudi women might be allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time at the London games, Saudi officials appear to have retreated. The only possibility remaining is that a few Saudi women might gain entry as &#8220;unofficial participants&#8221;. Saudi women must walk behind men at home, but they cannot walk behind the Saudi flag in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/15">A few months ago, Human Rights Watch reported discrimination against female athletes in that Islamic kingdom. Even physical education classes and sports club memberships for women are prohibited. The report referred to a religious scholar who said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/16">&#8220;the health of a virgin girl will be affected by too much movement and jumping in sports such as soccer and basketball.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/17">How ridiculous is that? The report concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/18">&#8220;It is impossible to square Saudi discrimination against women with the noble values of the Olympic Charter&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/19">which forbids intolerance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/20">Under the kafala system of sponsorship, by which foreigners can work in the country only if they have a sponsor who organises contracts, salaries, visas and repatriation, sponsors use their control to exploit workers by taking away their passports or residence permits away, or by failing to pay wages on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/21">I welcome the free and&#8212;it appears&#8212;fair and peaceful elections in Egypt, there are still problems in the country. I was there with the Foreign Affairs Committee a few months ago. Human rights violations continue to take place, in some cases to a worse extent than under Mubarak. Military trials continue; reports of the use of torture are frequent; freedom of expression is curtailed; and peaceful demonstrations have often been met with violence and repression. Additionally, civil society and NGOs continue to be repressed and restricted. The trial of foreign NGO workers who were arrested for allegedly breaching Egypt&#8217;s law on association, which took place during the Committee&#8217;s visit, is due to continue on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-05">5 June</phrase>. The law on association has criticised repeatedly by UN treaty bodies and human rights experts and is likely to be replaced by a new law by the new Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/22">Women&#8217;s rights are under threat in Egypt, and there are only eight women in Egypt&#8217;s 500-seat Parliament. We met many parliamentarians and raised that point with them. They have removed their quota system, which ensured proper representation for women in the Parliament. Activists in Egypt have serious concerns that the personal status code, which currently provides some equality for women in divorce and custody law, could be repealed, resulting in women&#8217;s rights being curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/23">Women human rights defenders and activists are being targeted with virginity testing, with those responsible being acquitted, and attacks and beatings. I have raised that in the Chamber several times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/24">In Afghanistan, women should not be abandoned by the pull-out of western troops or traded in favour of reconciliation with the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Afghanistan remains a key foreign policy priority of the UK Government, and as a major international partner and donor, they can exert significant diplomatic influence on the Afghan Government and the transitional process. Only a couple of months ago, Afghanistan&#8217;s ulema council&#8212;the country&#8217;s leading group of religious clerics&#8212;published a statement in which it referred to women as secondary to men and implied that violence against women was appropriate in some cases. Worryingly, President Karzai expressed support for the statement, in a move seen as widely conciliatory to the Taliban and other groups that would curtail the rights of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/25">Women&#8217;s security continues to be extremely fragile in areas of Afghanistan under Taliban control. Women who contribute politically or in the public and civic sectors face considerable pressure and intimidation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1329.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" speakername="Lyn Brown" colnum="1329"  time="014:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0002.htm#12052457001315">
	<p pid="a.1329.2/1">That is possibly an offer that I cannot possibly refuse. I think that sounds like an excellent thing to do together.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/2">Newham has a lower incidence of cancer than many other areas, but sadly our mortality rate is higher. The London-wide cancer mortality rate is about 112 deaths per 100,000 cases. In Newham it is 123 deaths per 100,000 cases, which is a significantly higher rate than we ought to find. That is clearly unacceptable. The five-year survival rate for women in Newham who have had breast cancer is 75%, which is significantly lower than the UK average of 83.4%. The reason is illustrated, in part, by the take-up rate of breast-screening services. In 2009-10, the take-up rate across England was 73%. Across London it was 62%, but in Newham it was 50%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/3">Early detection enables treatment in early stages, when the cancer is easier to treat and when women&#8217;s chances of survival are higher. In my area, the combination of late presentation and late diagnosis leads to treatment that is, of necessity, more complex and less successful. That is causing the unnecessary deaths of too many women. Those deaths are, frankly, preventable. I will be seeking to ensure that a consequence of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is not a visible deterioration in health screening services in my constituency. In fact, I will be hoping to see the 50% uptake of screening in Newham increase in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/4">I want to turn to international comparisons. I have before me some statistics, which were helpfully provided by the House of Commons Library. These data are drawn from a cancer epidemiology research project on the survival of cancer patients in 24 European countries. The figures need to be treated with some care, given that the most recent are for survival rates for those diagnosed between 1995 and 1999, but they provide a useful snapshot of the five-year survival rate. For England, the survival rate for all cancers at five years was 47.3%, ranking us 17th out of the 24 countries. The survival rate at five years for breast cancer was somewhat better, at 79.7%, but this still ranks us just 13th out of the 24 countries. That international comparison raises some disturbing questions about the effectiveness of our screening, diagnosis and treatment services, and I intend to return to that matter in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/5">One issue that I want to explore further today is the use in treatment of radiotherapy and, specifically, of new and advanced forms of radiotherapy such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy&#8212;IMRT. Radiotherapy treatment is more effective in treating all forms of cancer, including breast cancer, especially when the cancer is diagnosed early. It can be targeted on the cancer much more effectively, thus limiting the damage caused to non-cancerous tissue. It is far less invasive than other treatments, it leads to better outcomes and it is a much better experience for the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/6">The use of radiotherapy is more advanced in Scotland and Wales. London is marginally better provided for than the rest of England, but that does not alter the fact that the UK as a whole is woefully behind the best-performing countries in the rest of Europe and the US in using advanced radiotherapy as an effective tool against cancer. Access rates to existing radiotherapy services are already lower than the 50% of cancer patients who it is generally agreed should receive the treatment. We do not even know how many breast cancer patients are able to access the more advanced IMRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/7">What assessment have the Government made of the impact of the Health and Social Care Act on the commissioning of radiotherapy, and on the supply of</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/8">suitably trained radiotherapists? From my perspective, it is entirely unclear where responsibility for the commissioning of radiotherapy will sit in the future arrangements of the NHS. The clinical commissioning groups are far too small to effectively manage it, and the position of the NHS Commissioning Board is obscure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/9">For radiotherapy, there is no is no equivalent of the big campaigns that we see in our newspapers. It has no equivalent of a big pharmaceutical company to promote it and lobby for new treatments, because there is no profit to be made from it. Radiotherapy is an effective treatment that is widely used in other countries, but it is patchily under-utilised here, to the detriment of cancer patients, and that is likely to be contributing to our relatively poor survival rates. In the absence of an external lobby promoting radiotherapy, I humbly suggest to the House that that responsibility lies here with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329.2/10">The issues that I have outlined today go to the heart of the quality of cancer care in this country. They need to be explored in more detail and subjected to more scrutiny so that the service offered across the country can be improved to the level of the very best, and not just the very best in this country, but the very best by international standards.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1331.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" speakername="Claire Perry" colnum="1331"  time="014:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0002.htm#12052457001316">
	<p pid="a.1331.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>, who spoke eloquently on an important topic. I look forward to our &#8220;walk for life&#8221; together.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/2">As I am sure everyone knows by now, I represent a military constituency. with 10,500 soldiers and at least the same number of family members, but because I have a tiny job helping the Secretary of State for Defence, I can never speak on military matters, so there is no point in hon. Members lobbying me about cap badges. I meet many members of the armed forces in my surgeries, however, and I want to speak today about a story that I heard during one such meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/3">Jan and Barry Burns came to see me in my surgery in Ludgershall, in the south of my constituency. Barry is a serving Army officer. I felt incredibly moved and educated by what I heard, and I was glad that I had boxes of tissues handy. The Burns parents came to tell me about their son Charlie, who died unexpectedly last year at the age of 10. I have a boy who will be 10 this summer, and it was very moving to be presented with that tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/4">Charlie Burns was a completely fit, well and happy 10-year-old who had an epileptic seizure, completely out of the blue, on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-07">Friday 7 October</phrase>. The paramedics arrived well within the target time, but they made a diagnosis that many people think was incorrect. They diagnosed a febrile convulsion, even though there was no associated temperature. Over the weekend, Charlie was fine, but subsequently his parents took him to their GP, as he was a little unwell. The GP correctly suggested that Charlie had suffered an epileptic seizure and that he should see a neurologist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-11">Tuesday 11 October</phrase>, Charlie went to school in Larkhill as usual and was absolutely fine. He was able to see his sister, Isabella, that evening&#8212;she goes to boarding school, so it was lucky that they saw each other that day. He went to bed at 8.45 that evening, and when his parents went to check on him later, they found that he had died in his sleep. They were of course horrified. Their little boy had, until the previous week,</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/6">been incredibly healthy. The coroner diagnosed the cause of death as sudden unexplained death from epilepsy&#8212;SUDEP&#8212;involving a massive cerebral haemorrhage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/7">The reason that Mr and Mrs Burns came to see me was that they had never heard of SUDEP before that awful tragedy struck their family. In fact, SUDEP kills more people in the UK than AIDS and cot death&#8212;conditions we have all heard of&#8212;combined. We have been educated recently to understand certain other conditions, including strokes&#8212;there has been a very good national education campaign to help us to understand the signs of strokes and what happens when someone suffers a stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/8">It is fitting that this week is national epilepsy week, running from <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-26">26 May</phrase>. Charlie&#8217;s parents really made me aware of this condition&#8212;sudden unexplained death from epilepsy. It is a silent killer. As a result of conversations with the parents, I believe that it is almost unknown, which means that parents are not looking out for the signs, and in many cases nor are paramedics and medical professionals. In my comments today, I intend no criticism of the local paramedic or hospital services; a separate inquiry is ongoing. It was the depths of the personal tragedy and the suddenness of the bereavement suffered by the Burns family that particularly resonated with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/9">I ask three things of colleagues today. The first is for them to help me raise the profile of a fantastic national charity, Epilepsy Bereaved, which works with parents and anyone who has suffered a bereavement through epilepsy. We should remember that more than 1,000 people a year are so affected. I was pleased to learn that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40339" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> had met the charity and done some publicity work last year, for which the family and the charity are extremely grateful. Secondly, there is no national standard register of epilepsy deaths, and one of the charity&#8217;s proposals is that the chief coroner should maintain such a record and have a standard diagnosis, so that we can understand the scale of the problem. I would heartily support such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.0/10">Finally, we call for a review of the guidance issued to medical professionals, particularly first responders, to help them to look out for signs of that type of seizure in otherwise healthy children. Charlie&#8217;s parents told me that children can come back very quickly from such episodes. Charlie came back after his attack and was conscious when the paramedics got there, although he was droopy, drowsy and not himself. If he had been taken to hospital at that point and a brain scan had been done, he just might have been saved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1333.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate, but I hesitate to do so after the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the hon. Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase>, who I thought made an excellent speech and spoke with considerable compassion about the death of her constituent. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond in the most appropriate manner possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/2">I seek to raise four issues on the Whitsun Adjournment. The first relates to the future of the custody suite at Harrow police station, which serves my constituency. I heard in April that the Metropolitan police were planning to close the custody suite in October. There are rumours this week that the decision has been put on hold and that a final decision on closing or saving it will be taken in the autumn. There certainly appears to be a considerable body of opinion within the higher levels of the Met in favour of closing the custody suite. That would leave Harrow with no custody suite, and one of only two London boroughs&#8212;both in the suburbs of London, as I understand the other is Richmond&#8212;without one. To date, there has been no proper explanation from the Metropolitan police of why they think Harrow&#8217;s custody suite, which has 13 cells, should close.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/3">I raised this issue on the Floor of the House during Home Office questions, and&#8212;understandably&#8212;the Home Secretary replied that it was an operational matter for the Metropolitan police. At first glance, she is absolutely right, Nevertheless, I encourage Ministers to use their influence to ask the Metropolitan police to reconsider.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/4">As I have said, Harrow&#8217;s custody suite consists of 13 cells. There are 5,000 &#8220;visits&#8221;, as they are called in the jargon, to those cells each year. Potentially, therefore, 5,000 prisoners would have to be held in other custody suites. I understand that the Metropolitan police want those who are arrested in Harrow to be housed at Kilburn and Wembley police stations. On one level, I am not concerned about where a prisoner from my constituency is housed. What concerns me and many of my constituents is that if prisoners have to be transported to those other custody suites for the purposes of an investigation into whether they have committed the crimes of which they are accused and preparation of paperwork for court appearances, substantial police officer time will be wasted. That would inevitably have an impact on the quality and number of investigations that can take place at Harrow. Travelling to Kilburn during the rush hour can take more than an hour, and</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/5">travelling to Wembley on cup final day can take a long time as well. According to one estimate, based on that figure of 5,000 visits a year, between 10,000 and 20,000 police officer hours could be wasted in transporting prisoners to the two new custody suites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/6">I understand that shortly after a custody suite closes, the CID team in the Met go to the replacement custody suite. Given that more than 100 CID officers are currently based at Harrow police station, my constituents are understandably concerned that those officers may find themselves permanently based at Wembley police station in Brent. That, too, would reduce the level and quality of policing in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/7">In an attempt to establish the reason for Metropolitan police&#8217;s decision, I tabled a freedom of information request asking them for details of all their custody suites, including the number of cells and the staffing levels. There are some 44 custody suites in London; 14 contain fewer cells than Harrow police station, and at many substantially more staff and police officers are based than are based at Harrow. The decision by the Metropolitan police to close the Harrow custody suite therefore does not appear to have been made on cost grounds. I am told that the Met may have had in mind the quality of the cells at Harrow and that some capital investment is certainly needed, but I am also told that there is no difference in quality between Harrow and Kilburn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/8">I was not consulted on, or even formally told of, the decision in advance. I have written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who has told me that an assistant commissioner will be writing to me to explain why Harrow police station has been singled out. I have not yet received that letter. I welcome the fact that the Met may well reconsider the decision, but I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will use his influence to encourage Home Office Ministers to have a quiet word in the ear of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and urge him to reverse it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/9">The second issue is the proposed airport in the Thames estuary. On behalf of the airports serving my constituency, notably Heathrow, I have concerns about that proposal. There are several noisy cheerleaders for the Thames estuary airport, even though it does not make sense in air traffic control terms, it would require hugely costly investment in roads, housing and other infrastructure, and years of architects&#8217;, planners&#8217; and traffic and environment consultants&#8217; time, and it certainly would not solve London&#8217;s immediate need for extra airport capacity. Many rival airports, notably Schiphol in the Netherlands, have experienced a significant increase in business in recent months. Given that the Thames estuary airport has not begun to go through any of its planning, environmental, financial or air traffic control assessment processes, owners of such rival airports must be licking their lips at the prospect of the months or even years they will have to attract international business away from London&#8217;s airports while the debate about a Thames estuary airport continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/10">National Air Traffic Services has quietly pointed out the considerable additional problems a Thames estuary airport will cause in London&#8217;s already congested airspace. It would sit directly under the central route into London&#8217;s airspace, so aeroplanes carrying thousands of passengers a year would be taking off and landing at the new airport through one of the world&#8217;s busiest airspaces. In short, a Thames estuary airport is about as sensible as</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/11">building a new cr&#232;che in the middle of a motorway. It would also shift the eastern boundary of London&#8217;s air traffic holding patterns, in turn opening up the need for negotiations with other nations about changes to UK airspace, which, at best, would mean another delay to any new airport&#8217;s start date. Worse still, there is the risk of creating an investment hiatus at London&#8217;s existing airports, as the business community waits to see whether the idea of a Thames estuary airport can really be made to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338.3/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40301" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase>, who has raised some very important issues about a team with a wonderful heritage in the game of rugby. I am pleased to contribute to this debate and although I do not intend to go on at great length, it is an enormous pleasure to be able to speak in this place without having to race the clock or strike out paragraphs from a speech because of a time limit being reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/2">I want to speak about graduated driver licensing, with would involve a change in the licensing regime for new drivers to restrict them to driving only in low-risk environments. I am very keen to raise this issue from the viewpoint of a father of four children, three of whom are now drivers. Like most parents, I had real concerns about my children&#8217;s safety in the critical period just after they passed their driving test. I have seen the effect</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/3">that a road traffic accident can have: when one of my teenage son&#8217;s great friends lost his life, it had an effect on the whole friendship group. I also speak as an observer at a local court where a young man was sentenced for causing by careless driving the death of his friend who was in the passenger seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/4">The first case showed me the effect of the loss of a young life on the friends of the person. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase> spoke movingly about the effects of the loss of a young life. The second case showed me how the behaviour of a young driver, late at night and when there was certainly an element of showing off, also caused the loss of a life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/5">What is the extent of the problem? According to the Department for Transport, one in five newly qualified drivers, most of them under the age of 25, has a crash within six months of obtaining their licence. According to the AA, a young driver is 10 times more likely to be involved in a serious collision than a more experienced driver.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/6">With that in mind, I draw the attention of the House to graduated driver licensing. Why is it necessary? A lot of research has been carried out by Dr Sarah Jones and Professor Stephen Palmer of Cardiff university, and they have put together a detailed report on the potential of graduated licensing to save lives. They draw attention to the driving conditions where risks are highest and note that they are exacerbated for new and young drivers: driving late at night, driving with passengers of a similar age and driving after drinking alcohol or taking drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/7">To save lives, those conditions need to be minimised, which is exactly what graduated driver licensing does. It reduces exposure to those conditions and builds on-road driving experience by providing an intermediate phase&#8212;where there is a degree of supervision and control&#8212;between being a learner and holding a full licence. The duration of the intermediate phase is a matter for consideration, so I shall not suggest a firm figure; some supporters have proposed between two and two and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/8">In the intermediate phase, a driver has complete permission to drive, but not at certain times of night and not with passengers. A further factor that might be introduced could be a restriction on the cubic capacity or horsepower of the engine of the car that new drivers are allowed to drive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/9">I have already touched on alcohol consumption, which would be zero, and on drug-driving. Drug taking is more prevalent among young people; as a generalisation it is probably safe to say that a greater proportion of drug taking occurs in the evening, so the provisions of the graduated driver licence would mean that the prospect of young people driving after taking drugs would reduce. A consultation paper by the AA in 2008, &#8220;Learning to Drive,&#8221; said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/10">&#8220;The drug driving problem is not adequately quantified at present, and it is likely that its greatest impact is among the young. If the drug driving problem is as great as some reports suggest, it could be a major reason for accident levels among young drivers. A recent AA Populus poll of 17,500 members showed that 50% felt that drug driving was as big a problem as drink driving.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/11">I am, therefore, pleased that the Government are aware of the issue, and I welcome the legislation announced in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to create a specific offence of drug-driving.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/12">Let us consider the difference between the present position and what would occur if graduated driver licensing were introduced. Currently, there is no restriction on a 17-year-old passing his or her test on one day and on the next driving a gang of mates in a powerful car with a 5 litre engine, capable of travelling at 150 mph. There is a problem that needs to be addressed. Research by Jones and Palmer into all accidents in Britain between 2000 and 2007 found that young people driving in certain conditions were more prone to accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/13">The key points are as follows: young drivers were involved in around 10% of all crashes; crashes involving older drivers decreased by 25% over the period, whereas those involving young drivers dropped by only 5%; a quarter of young driver crashes occurred between 9 pm and 6 am; a quarter of young driver crashes occurred when the young driver was carrying at least one other passenger aged between 15 and 24; half of young driver crash casualties, and 70% of the fatalities, occurred between 9 pm and 6 am and with at least one 15 to 24-year-old in the car; 50% of young driver fatalities occurred either between 10 pm and 5 am or with at least one 15 to 19-year-old in the car; and, perhaps most strikingly, they found that fatal crashes involving older drivers decreased by 15%, while those involving young drivers increased by 15%. The figures show that there is a real problem when it comes to young drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/14">The Government have a position on this. I raised the matter in the House during questions to the then Transport Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-27">27 January 2011</phrase>. I asked him for the Government&#8217;s view on graduated driver licensing. I understand that the Government are not in favour. He gave me two reasons for that. First, he said that other countries that have graduated driver licensing</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/15">&#8220;suffer worse safety records than the UK&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-01-27.437"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 January 2011; Vol. 522, c. 437</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/16">That might be so, but I still think that the number of fatalities among our young people means that the matter should be considered properly. Secondly, he said, in defence of the existing situation, that introducing the system would reduce the mobility of young people and have a negative effect on their participation in the labour market and in higher education. What proportion of young drivers are participating in the labour market or higher education during the hours when graduated driver licensing would impose a restriction, bearing in mind that we are taking about late at night? I cannot see how that argument stands up in relation to a young person driving with his friends at 2 o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/17">In 2008 the Government conducted a review of the learner driver process, &#8220;Learning to Drive&#8221;, and considered graduated driver licensing. They concluded that the reform of driver training and testing is a more appropriate and effective method of dealing with the problem. The Department for Transport said that graduated driver licensing</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/18">&#8220;would bring extensive social and economic costs&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/19">With regard to costs, we know that there is economic value in saving a life. In 2003 the Health and Safety Executive formulated a cost-benefit analysis that put the cost of a life lost in a fatality at &#163;1.3 million. Cardiff university has carried out some research on the value of preventing deaths in relation to two models of graduated driver licensing&#8212;either between 9 pm and 6 am or between 10 pm and 5 am. Under the stricter model, it</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/20">calculated savings at &#163;247 million a year, and under the less strict model it calculated them at &#163;162 million. Therefore, in addition to reducing the distress we have already heard about today, there would be significant economic benefits from introducing graduated driver licensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/21">Elsewhere in the world, graduated driver licensing was first used in New Zealand in 1987 and has since been implemented across the United States, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe. The programmes used in each of those countries vary, and I am not at this stage making a case for which system we should adopt, but the principle of restricting new drivers remains the same in all cases. The research from Cardiff university shows that the impacts will vary, but the best result that has been seen is in Ontario, where crash fatalities among young people decreased by 76% over two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338.3/22">In conclusion, the number of young driver crashes is clearly disproportionately high. The issue touches almost everybody: parents, relatives and friends of the young people involved. Action can be taken. I question whether the Government&#8217;s current position of looking for more training and testing will be sufficient. I firmly believe that an approach that decreases the risks to which young drivers expose themselves will help reduce the number of young driver incidents. I urge the Government to look again at the positive effects that a new system of licensing could have in achieving what we all wish to see: the young people of our country being safer on our roads and fewer people having to go through the kind of experience that my son and his friends went through.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1341.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="1341"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0002.htm#12052457001329">
	<p pid="a.1341.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40510" name="Mark Pawsey">the hon. Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey)</phrase>, whose suggestion I entirely endorse. He revealed, though, two of the biggest problems that all hon. Members and, indeed, Government Front Benchers, face: the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome; and the Whitehall expert who knows best and will always find a reason why something cannot be done and should not be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/2">I always admired Gladstone, who brought in a tax for just six months. We should experiment, try the graduated driver&#8217;s licence scheme for a year or two and see whether it produces good results. I have seen it work over a number of years in France. After someone passes their driving test in that country, they have to drive around for a year with a large letter &#8220;A&#8221; on the back of their car, for &#8220;apprentice&#8221;. That is what it means in French.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/3">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about people not going out late at night when they have taken drugs or had a drink is extremely important. Fatalities in France are much higher for lots of other reasons, such as bad road management, speed limits and drink driving, but they are coming down fast. We have a good record, but each life lost&#8212;particularly that of a young person&#8212;is a terrible tragedy for the families concerned, so I wish him all the very best with his campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/4">I wish to talk briefly about the steel industry and my region of south Yorkshire, and it is an enormous pleasure to do so in the company, on the Opposition Front Bench, of my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/5">and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith), because she has one of Britain&#8217;s most important steel engineering plants in her constituency and is a doughty champion of it. That plant is linked to a major one in Rotherham, and on this issue we have been able to combine action over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/6">The issue has to be set in the broader context of today&#8217;s extraordinarily sad news from the Office for National Statistics, which reports that our economy is again contracting. We are shrinking. We have that extraordinary malady of the ever-shrinking British economy under this Government. In the first quarter of this year it was down 0.3%, which is an increase in negative growth on the first estimate of 0.2%, but within that overall figure we have some rather more worrying statistics, which impact on the broader south Yorkshire manufacturing economy, including not only steel, but engineering, construction and all the things that go into &#8220;making&#8221; Britain, rather than the financial services or the huge amounts of money that the City makes. Indeed, one of the huge problems with the current Government is that the Cabinet knows the south of France better than it knows the north of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/7">According to the ONS, construction output declined by 4.8% in the first three months of this year, after a 0.2% decline in the fourth quarter last year. That is absolutely catastrophic, and one of the biggest components of any aspect of construction, from roads, to houses, office blocks, new schools and hospital wings, is steel, so, when the construction industry declines by 5% under our nation&#8217;s current economic stewards, that signals very bad news for steel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/8">There has been no growth at all in manufacturing. There are of course some pockets of growth, and, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" name="John Spellar">the Member for Warley (Mr Spellar)</phrase> pointed out earlier today, the car industry is doing better, so I accept fully that the situation is uneven, but we are a United Kingdom Parliament, not a south of England Parliament or a Parliament just for the City, and our policies have to help all of the country, not just parts of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/9">Debt is the enemy of any good stewardship of the nation, although I have to say that I have probably been in debt all my life: it is called a mortgage. But, providing I have been able to manage that debt and to pay the interest rates, I have not been crippled by it. When William Pitt became Prime Minister in 1784, the average national income of Great Britain was &#163;23 million and the national debt of Great Britain was &#163;240 million. In other words, the national debt was 10 times the national income. That did not faze Pitt, but it seems to faze his old Etonian successor, our current Prime Minister, who thinks that an infinitesimally smaller level of debt is something that has to bring the entire UK economy to a juddering halt. I am not suggesting that we return to Pittite days of massive debt to national income ratios, but we have to strike a balance, and we will certainly not tackle any of our debt if we do not swiftly move to growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/10">I want to turn to the steel industry. I accept that some Government Ministers, including the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, are interested in steel and have come to the advanced manufacturing plant in Rotherham, on the border with Sheffield, to see the excellent work done there by Rolls-Royce, Boeing and other companies. I invite a Minister to come to a</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/11">steel plant, either in my constituency or that of my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge, where they will be told about the extraordinarily international nature of the steel industry and about the fact that what goes into making steel entirely determines its profitability and the future sustainability of any part of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/12">The big problem that we face is the obsession with front-loading on to the steel industry the general problem of climate change. I am talking about steel, but I am not excluding other industries. I am sure that hon. Members with connections to the glass or ceramics industry, or to other high-energy-using industries, would make the same point on their behalf. There has been a culture, not necessarily under this Government, of saying, &#8220;Heavy industry bad; anything else good.&#8221; Well, I am sorry, but we are not going to move away into an economy of which steel does not remain an essential component part. Steel is vital, sometimes in very small elements, whether it be in our cars, our mobile telephones or the planes we travel in&#8212;modern steel, high-tech steel, flexible steel. Steel is also a huge recycling industry. It is not generally understood that steel production is based on gobbling up and reusing old, unused steel that would otherwise have to go into landfill or clutter up the landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/13">In this year&#8217;s Budget, our southern-oriented Chancellor outlined policies that will have a detrimental effect on the UK steel industry. He confirmed that the Government will calculate the 2014-15 prices support rates, equivalent to &#163;9.55 per tonne of carbon dioxide, in line with the carbon price floor, using the methodology set out in the 2011 Budget. This has increased from the indicative rate set last year of &#163;7.28 per tonne. That is a response to the dramatic fall in carbon prices seen last summer. EU allowances reached record lows at the beginning of this year, so the support rate or tax applied in the UK needs to go up to achieve the floor. That means that next year the rate will be nearly double that in 2014, which was meant to stand at &#163;4.94 per tonne but is now set much higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/14">I am sorry that this is quite complicated, technical stuff to bring to the House. I am not trying to make a partisan point; indeed, I pay tribute to Ministers, who have always been willing to receive delegations of MPs from steel industry areas. Part of the problem is that such a level of technical detail is impossible to get across in parliamentary questions. One has to dig into fairly technical steel technology and steel industry publications to find this material, because it never features on the front page of any newspaper or business section.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/15">In response to the increase in the carbon price floor, BIS has allocated &#163;250 million in compensation to cover the 2013-15 period. Given that our steel industry has a value of about &#163;3 billion a year, &#163;250 million will not be sufficient to counteract the negative effect of the carbon price floor. That might cause lasting damage to the British steel industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/16">I plead with the Government&#8212;the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department of Energy and Climate Change&#8212;to rethink their policies. They can, by all means, insist that we reduce CO2 emissions. However, they should not use methodologies and prices that are changing so rapidly that they will do damage when rigidly applied. Believe me, when civil servants want to apply something rigidly, they do. On</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/17">the whole, Ministers, however well-intentioned they are, are not across every detail of such decisions. Without it being an intended consequence, if we allow the present structure of carbon reduction through price support mechanisms to continue, we may face serious damage to our steel industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/18">Secondly, there is the pledge to consult on simplifying the carbon reduction commitment energy efficiency scheme, or CRCEES as it is known in the trade, to attempt to reduce the administrative burden on business. The Government have said that they are ready to look at replacing those revenues with an alternative environmental tax. However, they have not specified how an environmental tax will be paid and which industries it will affect. We also had the statement on feed-in tariffs earlier today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/19">Last night, I had the most extraordinary exchange with Mr Nigel Farage on LBC. His new term for the Prime Minister is a &#8220;warmist&#8221;. I had never heard of warmism before, but in the lexicon of the UK Independence party, it is apparently used to denounce people who like renewable energy and wind turbines, and who think that we are facing global warming. Mr Farage obviously knows better that global warming is an EU conspiracy to undermine Britain. He thinks that the louder he calls the Prime Minister a warmist, the more people will flock to vote for UKIP. I do not know whether that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/20">At the moment, only non-energy-intensive firms and organisations are bound by the carbon reduction commitment. We have to look at other ways in which we can support energy intensive industries, and the steel industry in particular. It is the most extraordinary sight to see steel being melted in Rotherham. Scrap is poured into a giant metal pot and a red-hot electrode goes in at about 2,000&#176; or 3,000&#176;. There is a huge explosion, upon which I have seen distinguished colleagues shake. It demonstrates the raw power of industry. In a sense, it is a process that has not changed since the days of Vulcan&#8212;heat is applied to iron ore or scrap metal and out flows molten steel&#8212;except that the process is magnified in temperature and size many times over. It is fantastically dramatic; sometimes tragically so, as accidents still happen. That is the raw nature of what has to be the core of our economy, because however high-tech, Googley and Facebooky we want to make the British economy, and however much we want to base it on the City and the financial services industry, it will still need houses, cars, hospitals and metal manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/21">The third problem is the extraordinary discrepancy between the fuel costs in this country and those of our major competitors. The most dramatic difference is with the United States, where shale gas is significantly reducing the cost of energy. I have graphs here, but I do not really want to give more figures. The price of fuel in the US is about 50% lower than that in the United Kingdom. That is why I support a dash for gas, based on shale gas. That could significantly reduce the UK&#8217;s dependence on imported energy sources. I am not against wind farms&#8212;how can one be?&#8212;but they will never provide the electricity that is needed to melt steel. Everybody wants to be able to press a switch and on comes the light, on comes the heating, on comes the hot shower, on comes the air conditioning or on comes whatever else, but that ain&#8217;t gonna happen from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/22">Finally, I want to consider the problem of electricity prices. I have a chart illustrating the estimated prices in 2015. I cannot hold it up, because we cannot do PowerPoint stuff in the Chamber, but in short, the best estimates show that the cost per megawatt-hour delivered in Germany will be about &#8364;50, and in the United Kingdom &#8364;70. In the United States it will be &#8364;35, in the Nordic countries &#8364;45 and in France a bit less than in Germany, maybe &#8364;48. Those are estimates, but we&#8212;by &#8220;we&#8221; I mean our steel industry&#8212;pay higher tax on electricity than the United States or our main European steel-making competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/23">I understand the desire to reduce our carbon output and the Treasury&#8217;s perfectly reasonable desire to get what tax it can from whatever source it can. I know that my speech could be described as special pleading, but the comparators with most other countries show that the British steel industry remains fundamentally disadvantaged by the higher cost of electricity, which is needed for melting steel. It cannot be done with a Bunsen burner or by putting the gas cooker on, it needs 2,000&#176; C to 3,000&#176; C-worth of electricity delivered fast and hard.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1352.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" speakername="David Amess" colnum="1352"  time="015:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001345">
	<p pid="a.1352.0/1">I congratulate the Backbench Business Committee, of which I confess I am a member, on providing this opportunity for debate. I have observed that some colleagues have used it extremely well, particularly in the case of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase>, who spoke so movingly. I congratulate her, too, on bringing the military wives choir to Portcullis House yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/2">I wish to raise a number of points on the Whitsun Adjournment. First, I have three early-day motions, which I urge colleagues to sign before we rise for the recess. The first congratulates West Ham United on being promoted to the premiership, despite some poor management and over-inflated ticket prices. The second congratulates Chelsea on beating Bayern Munich. The third, with which I suspect Conservative Members might be pleased, condemns the behaviour of some of the people attending the Police Federation conference. I thought that their behaviour was disgraceful, particularly the way they tried to bully and intimidate the Home Secretary. I thought that, for them, it was a public relations disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/3">I shall turn now to online newspaper comments. I am increasingly concerned with the whole system whereby people can publish material in electronic newspaper articles without supplying their names and addresses. This is totally unacceptable. There are swear words and expletives, but there seems to be no legislation to deal with the problem. None of us really has the money to fight cases through the courts, even if that were possible. I know that whenever an article is written about me in one local newspaper&#8212;which I do not send to it&#8212;the abuse is endless. It is water off a duck&#8217;s back for me, but for some people who are rather close to me it can be a little bit offensive. I welcome the Defamation Bill, but I think that there should be much stricter controls. It is absolutely gutless not to force those who wish to say abusive things online to leave their names and addresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/4">Public anger has recently been directed at the high pay received by private sector bosses, most notably those in the big banks, but what regulation is there to deal with some public sector executives? In 2009, 31 council bosses earned more than the Prime Minister, which is crazy, and chief executives of public bodies can take home more than &#163;250,000 a year. I am not satisfied that there is proper scrutiny of public organisations, including some in Essex such as the probation service and NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/5">I find it less than acceptable that a Member of Parliament should have to resort to the Freedom of Information Act to confirm, after a number of months, that those who were consulted on the closure of Leigh police station lived miles away, so effectively there was no consultation. It has taken me two years just to confirm that the present chief constable of Essex was chosen from a shortlist of one. That is outrageous.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/6">Apparently the other candidates had withdrawn on the day. When I asked who had made the decision not to re-advertise the position, I was told that the decision had been made in the first instance by Essex police authority. That says it all. In 30 years, Essex police authority has never engaged with me, as a Member of Parliament. As I have said, there needs to be much greater scrutiny. Anyone can get rid of Members of Parliament after&#8212;now&#8212;five years, but some public bodies seem to be a law unto themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352.0/7">I must admit that one of my children had an unfortunate experience recently with a private clamping company. We are dealing with it through the small claims court, and I am determined that we will win. To charge someone &#163;480 and then intimidate and bully them is totally unacceptable. I understand that the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 will outlaw wheel-clamping on private land, and I welcome that, but I think that private clamping companies should be much more tightly regulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40634" name="David Mowat">the hon. Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)</phrase>, who has been very active in the Chamber this week. I am sure that he is active every week, but he has been on his feet and successfully been called every day that I have been in the House, and I have been in on each of the past four days. I congratulate him on his activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/2">I am conscious of your admonition to be brief, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I shall try to rattle through a number of issues. It is a pleasure to see the Deputy Leader of the House in his place and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase> in hers and I look forward to their responses in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/3">As an east London MP, it would be wholly wrong of me not to start my comments by referring to the Olympics. Sometimes my classic cockney accent confuses people, but my constituency is in docklands and we are looking forward to the Olympics very much. My wife,</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/4">Dr Sheila Fitzpatrick, and I attended a test event two weekends ago and the excitement at Stratford&#8212;at a test event&#8212;was palpable. As we have all seen on the television this week, the arrival of the Olympic torch has shown that excitement is building. Clearly, there will be much to enjoy this summer and we wish successful for outcomes for the British athletes and Olympic team. We hope that transport arrangements in London work as effectively as they ought to and I am sure that under Peter Hendy, the chief executive of Transport for London, that will be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/5">On the subject of TFL, we are desperate for another river crossing&#8212;at least one. I know that the Government and the Mayor of London are committed to two, and we want to see them as quickly as possible. The area east of Tower bridge is now lived in by almost half of London&#8217;s population and we have only four crossings. West of Tower bridge, there are 20-plus crossings. We need extra crossings on the Thames, or else east London will gridlock and the driver for this great capital city for the next generation or two will be stalled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/6">As a former Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty&#8217;s Household, I look forward to the diamond jubilee and to the celebrations of that, which will be a portent of those that will follow during the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/7">I want to mention the ten-minute rule Bill proposed recently by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on the labelling of food, particularly halal food, in relation to animal welfare. That debate was sidetracked and ended up being presented as an attack on the Muslim and Jewish communities. My support for that Bill was based on animal welfare grounds. It has subsequently been publicised that the percentage of halal meat in the UK coming from animals that were stunned is around 90%. The debate about meat labelling in relation to animal welfare therefore ought not to be about whether meat is halal or kosher but about whether the animal was stunned or unstunned, because the vast majority of people want to buy food that is labelled accurately and honestly, and animal welfare is a huge issue for many people. This is not an attack on Islam or on the Jewish community; it is about promoting the best animal welfare standards. I give credit to Mehdi Hasan for his very insightful article in the <i>New Statesman</i>, which clarified these issues and demonstrated that we should be promoting this not as an issue of prejudice but as an issue of animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/8">Let me address an issue of increasing significance in east London&#8212;leaseholders&#8217; rights. Whether leaseholders are former council or social landlord tenants who have exercised the right to buy or whether they are private tenants who have bought a leasehold property through a mortgage, there can be a hike in service charges and insurance charges, and there is a gap in protection in relation to management companies, particularly disreputable ones. I am talking about a lot of professional people in east London&#8212;lawyers, doctors and architects&#8212;who have bought very expensive properties and are then paying tens of thousands of pounds in parking charges, service charges and insurance charges. There is a gap in the protection available to people from those who have the freehold of land. Once someone signs a leasehold agreement, they are basically at the mercy of the freeholder into the future. This issue needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/9">In today&#8217;s papers, there was a story about the lady who was, sadly, bitten by a dog and is suffering from rabies. I had a meeting this morning with the World Society for the Protection of Animals, which is seeking support from the Departments for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for International Development. The WSPA has an initiative called &#8220;Red Collar&#8221; under which it is immunising dogs in third-world countries against rabies. Our citizen, who was bitten when she was in a foreign country, might well have benefited from that programme, and I encourage DFID and DEFRA to support the WSPA&#8217;s &#8220;Red Collar&#8221; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/10">The main issue I want to raise is that of housing benefit. I supported Ken Livingstone in the mayoral campaign, but I have to give credit to the Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson for certain comments that he has made in recent months and years. In October 2010, he told BBC London:</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/11">&#8220;The last thing we want to have in our city is a situation such as Paris where the less well-off are pushed out to the suburbs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/12">He went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/13">&#8220;I&#8217;ll emphatically resist any attempt to recreate a London where the rich and poor cannot live together&#8230;We will not see and we will not accept any kind of Kosovo-style social cleansing of London.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/14">He concluded by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/15">&#8220;On my watch, you are not going to see thousands of families evicted from the place where they have been living and have put down roots.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/16">This Tuesday morning, I had a meeting with Jobcentre Plus officers from east London, as a result of which I have come here today to raise this issue. For two years I have been going to the Table Office to bid in the draw to ask a question in Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, but I have been spectacularly unsuccessful. I have bid again for our first week back in June and if I get a chance to ask the Prime Minister a question, it will be about the housing benefit cap, which will result in the forced eviction of hundreds of families from my constituency. Jobcentre Plus told me that there are 900 households in the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse whose benefits exceed the cap that the coalition is bringing in by an average of &#163;200 but that some exceed it by &#163;800. Those people are getting letters this week and next week in which they are basically being told that on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year they are going to be evicted from their home. Nobody supports scroungers or benefit cheats. There are many hundreds of decent people in those families who have not been able to secure employment, through no fault of their own, and they are trying to do their best. The members of those families who will be punished are the children. That is not fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/17">Many Government Members are concerned about the issue and London coalition MPs have raised it with the Government. I encourage them to continue to do so. If the plans go through, hundreds of families in my constituency and thousands more across inner London will be forcibly evicted. I cannot imagine what that will do for the future of the children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/18">My last point is about Bangladesh, although I do not want to encroach on the Adjournment debate to be introduced at 6 o&#8217;clock by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe)</phrase>. He will be raising the abduction and disappearance of Mr Illias Ali, a senior member of the Bangladesh Nationalist party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/19">Between 20% and 25% of my constituents are Bangladeshi. The Labour party and the Government party in Bangladesh&#8212;the Awami League&#8212;have strong connections, and I am a big supporter of the Awami League Government. However, there are noises from Bangladesh about civil society there. The USA Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, expressed concerns when she visited Dhaka recently, and the Foreign Secretary has been raising the issues, and I have written to him, the Bangladesh high commissioner and the Prime Minister of Bangladesh about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/20">As everyone knows, Bangladesh is one of the five poorest countries in the world. Its population is twice the size of Britain&#8217;s in a land mass two thirds the size of England. A quarter of the country is under water for a third of the year. There are massive problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/21">Bangladesh is a young democracy. We are an old democracy, but we still make mistakes. In Bangladesh, some mistakes are made. When the Bangladesh Nationalist party won the previous general election, Awami League Members boycotted Parliament for a year, and I criticised them for that. When the Awami League won the election, BNP Members boycotted Parliament for a year and I criticised them too. We need to support Bangladesh and the Awami League Government and to give every assistance to make sure that the people who disappeared are found, and that there is justice and transparency in civic society. Through the Department for International Development, we also need to give support for the economy, which is growing at 6%&#8212;unlike the British economy, which shrank by 0.3% in the last quarter&#8212;so that Bangladesh continues to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356.0/22">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise these questions, and I look forward to the responses in due course.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1359.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" speakername="Martin Vickers" colnum="1359"  time="016:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001350">
	<p pid="a.1359.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. There have been some interesting, fascinating and moving contributions, although I have to take issue with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>. He said that the highlight will be the Olympic torch going to Southend; in fact, the highlight will be on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-26">26 June</phrase> when the torch arrives in Cleethorpes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" name="Denis MacShane">The right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr MacShane)</phrase> spoke about the high cost of energy to our high energy using industries. Many of them are along the Humber bank in my constituency, and many of my constituents work at the Tata steelworks in the neighbouring constituency of Scunthorpe. Energy costs are of considerable concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/3">The main focus of my contribution will be on the town of Immingham, but first I want to talk about static caravans&#8212;an issue ably raised earlier by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase>. I remind Ministers that the imposition of VAT on those caravans will be extremely damaging for local economies such as Cleethorpes. For many people, their caravan is a second home, but for others it is their first home. The caravans are occupied for up to 10 months a year, which extends the season, providing jobs for those who are dependent on seasonal work. The caravan sites are not just in Cleethorpes; there are many small sites in rural areas, such as Barton-upon-Humber and other locations in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/4">Many Members will have heard of the Venerable Bede, but they may be unaware of Imma, who was someone Bede wrote about. Imma was a thane in the service of the King of Northumbria. As the House will probably realise, he gave his name to the town of Immingham. Immingham, in partnership with the port of Grimsby, is by tonnage the largest port in the UK. It will celebrate its centenary this year on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-22">22 July</phrase>, 100 years after the official opening by His Majesty King George V. Prior to the establishment of the modern port, Immingham had many maritime connections. Many of the pilgrim fathers set sail from the town, an event commemorated there by a magnificent memorial.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/5">Since then, Immingham has grown from a village to a town of which the residents are rightly proud. Unfortunately, like many smaller towns, it has suffered as a result of increasing centralisation by both public and private sector organisations, and it is the public services that have caused most concern. Northern Lincolnshire, as a whole, has a low-wage economy and towns such as Immingham find it difficult to sustain many of the services that larger towns take for granted. Leisure centres, sports facilities and the like cannot be provided profitably by the private sector and local authorities find it increasingly difficult to fund such projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/6">It is essential that Immingham and similar towns are not forgotten, so help and support for alternative provision must be explored. Very small amounts of public funding can attract other funding streams, as was the case with the recently opened skate park. The consultation, funding and local community leadership that came together to achieve the skate park are a model of how such projects can be achieved. All involved deserve praise and the thanks of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/7">The arrival&#8212;soon, we hope&#8212;of a new Tesco store and the associated regeneration of the shopping centre will provide a major boost to an area that has an extremely bright future if the new developments associated with the offshore renewable energy sector can be successfully established in northern Lincolnshire. On that matter, I once again stress the urgent need for statutory agencies to work at the pace required by the commercial demands of potential investors. Much has been done and I appreciate the Government&#8217;s changes to the planning system, but time is of the essence if the UK is to attract the investment that multinational companies could easily direct to our continental neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/8">The Able UK development, which is just a couple of miles from Immingham, promises thousands of jobs. The Government recognised that in establishing the largest enterprise zone in the country but, as I have said, speed is of the essence. Page 45 of the Budget&#8217;s Red Book states that final decisions on the Able marine energy park are needed within a year. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/9">&#8220;the Government will reduce unnecessary cost and delay to developers by: setting up a Major Infrastructure and Environment Unit; streamlining guidance; setting clearer standards for evidence; and changing the culture of statutory bodies.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/10">That is something that I hope will proceed apace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/11">Only a couple of weeks ago, the Government announced additional funding for the preparatory work for the much-needed upgrade of the A160, which provides access to the Able development and Immingham docks, a clear indication, I hope, that construction work will begin by 2015 at the latest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/12">Another plea is that much of Immingham, Habrough and Stallingborough, which are major industrial areas, lack adequate broadband capacity, so urgent attention is required to correct that, and I commend the work of One Voice Immingham in pushing forward with its campaign to highlight that. While on matters digital, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the success of the Channel 7 local community TV station, the only successful station remaining of the original stations established about 10 years ago, which has been based in Immingham for much of that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/13">In conclusion, Immingham docks are an excellent and key driver of the local economy and, under the management of John Fitzgerald, Simon Brett and their management team, have continued to expand and play an important role in the community. Like many of our ports, Immingham was begun by the railways, in this case the Great Central Railway. During world war one it was a submarine base, and for a time during world war two, Lord Mountbatten used it as a shore base and the docks played host to HMS Kelly. His lordship stayed at one of the town&#8217;s most notable establishments, the County hotel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/14">In more recent years, the docks have developed to the extent that one quarter of the tonnage of freight moved in the UK by rail starts or finishes in Immingham, and last month it was my pleasure to be present when a former Member of this House, Michael Portillo, travelled to Immingham to name a locomotive, &#8220;The Port of Immingham&#8221;. I also commend his TV programme, to be shown next January, documenting a journey from Portsmouth to Immingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/15">Immingham, like all communities, has its share of social problems, but if some or all of the potential developments come to pass it has a bright future. We look forward to celebrating its centenary over the weekend of 20 to <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-23">23 July</phrase>. If any Cabinet Minister would like to attend, I am still looking for volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359.0/16">I have mentioned just a few of the organisations and individuals who play their part in the community of Immingham, and I place on the record my thanks to them. Immingham has seen many ups and downs over the years, but it has a bright future, and I shall welcome any Member who pays the town a visit on its centenary.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1361.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590" speakername="Neil Carmichael" colnum="1361"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001351">
	<p pid="a.1361.0/1">It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate, partly because it comes after a productive Session for the Government in terms of passing legislation, and partly because we are on the threshold of an interesting year in terms of future legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/2">I am also pleased that we have the opportunity to talk sensibly about economic growth, because that is one of the key issues that underpin all our activities in this House, especially at this time. One or two Opposition Members have today criticised the Government&#8217;s economic policy, but in truth we have to address the deficit problem, and that goes hand in hand with paving the way for economic growth. The two have the same role and responsibility in providing economic recovery, so I reiterate how important it is that we stick to our strategy of cutting the deficit and paving the way for rebalancing the economy, something I shall talk about in the first half of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/3">It is very important that we ensure that manufacturing and engineering are promoted. In my constituency, almost one in five employees are in manufacturing or engineering, so it is a significant part of my constituency&#8217;s economic activity, and that is one reason why I held a festival for manufacturing and engineering back in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/4">The festival had several aims, one of which was to highlight the success of existing firms and businesses, of which we have many, in my constituency. Recently, Advanced Insulation won the Queen&#8217;s award for enterprise, and we should celebrate that. It is emblematic of the firms in my constituency, and a strong illustration of the kind of firm we need more of, not just in Stroud, but throughout the country. Celebrating what we have is, therefore, part of the process of shining a spotlight on manufacturing and saying, &#8220;This is the sector where we are doing well, and we are going to do even better.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/5">The second objective of my festival was to engage young people in manufacturing and engineering, and to say to them, &#8220;This is an opportunity&#8212;a place full of opportunities&#8212;for employment, your career and your progress.&#8221; During that week, we managed to engage almost 300 students directly in firms that support my initiative to do exactly that. I noticed that the more engaged they became, the more interested they seemed to be in manufacturing and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/6">We in this country have to stop talking about the less attractive aspects of manufacturing and engineering and start pointing out that it is a modern, clean, interesting working environment where technology is at the core of successful firms that are making progress in adding value, exporting and simply generating new ideas, and that that is really good place to be. We must get that message across not only to the general populace but to young people in schools and colleges so that their engagement with manufacturing and engineering is more intense and therefore more reflective of their own needs and requirements. It is important that we put down a marker for a continued thrust towards engagement between schools, colleges and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/7">The third objective of my festival was to make sure that we understand the opportunities for investment in business and in new ideas. We need to think about firms&#8217; strategic planning in terms of how they develop their capital, ideas and technologies. We were able to draw on the experiences of many firms in my constituency that are already doing that, including successful small and medium-sized enterprises such as Renishaw, Delphi and Nampak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/8">We need to create a culture that will turn the debate from one in which we say &#8220;We must rebalance the economy&#8221;&#8212;because we are already doing that&#8212;into one in which we say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to focus on what is important in terms of the real economy.&#8221; As Sir John Rose has noted, economic growth is all about growing something, digging something up or making something, and our focus must be on the latter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/9">There were several aspects that I covered in my festival, such as the role of banking and the need to be more flexible in our attitudes towards it, not only in terms of banks being less high street-oriented and target-driven but through firms thinking about different ways of seeking finance, attracting equity and planning their financial strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/10">Supply chains have been mentioned a few times in this debate and in Business, Innovation and Skills questions, and that is not surprising, because they are very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/11">They are becoming increasingly complex and dependent on a work force who are flexible, adaptable, well trained and embrace all the manufacturing and engineering skills that are needed in an advanced economy. Airbus, which is not far from my constituency, sucks in a huge amount of its materials and component parts from all over the south-west, including my constituency. The success of Airbus therefore has an immediate impact on the people of my constituency. We must ensure that our supply chains are properly supported, that the infrastructure is in place for them to work properly, and that there are opportunities for local firms to get connected to them. BIS is doing some useful work in that context, and I applaud that. All those of us who are interested in the real economy need to be more vigorous in our exposition of what a supply chain is and how supply chains really matter to our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/12">On engineering, we need to bring together what is being done across many Departments. We need to say that engineering matters to the future of the British economy. Perhaps we need a chief engineering adviser, like we have a chief scientific adviser, to put the spotlight on engineering, because it is a big subject. Making things is a big subject, but the engineering aspect is especially important. We must bring together all the component parts of the world of engineering. I would like the Government to move in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" name="Denis MacShane">The right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr MacShane)</phrase> rightly spoke about energy, its cost and the hunger for it in industries such as steel and manufacturing. We have to think carefully about energy supply and the way in which we create energy. I am pleased that the Government are introducing an energy Bill to look at the market and the mechanisms, and at how we can attract the right infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/14">We need to think more carefully about energy and electricity storage. We have too many peaks and troughs, and our energy system is too dependent on a grid that loses energy. We can argue about how much energy is lost through the grid, but energy is lost. We can also argue about the technologies that we use to create energy, but we need to start talking about the storage of energy as well. There are some interesting ideas. Liquid air, which has being advanced recently by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, is the kind of energy storage system that could be really useful. It is similar to existing technologies, so it would not be a great leap. We need to provide a market framework for such technologies. I hope that that will be proposed in the energy Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/15">I want to ram home my three points. First, manufacturing and engineering are imperative for economic growth and I am excited about them. Secondly, it is critical that we have the right market framework to provide that boost and to put a spotlight on engineering. Thirdly, there must be links between schools, colleges and business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/16">I will change subjects briefly, because there is something else on my mind that deserves to be raised in this debate: school governance. I have set up the all-party parliamentary group on education governance and leadership. We need to consider the accountability of schools as academies become more numerous. There is a live debate about the links between the Department for Education and our schools. School governors have a role to play in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/17">There are some 230,000 school governors, but there are also vacancies on governing bodies and there is an issue with recruitment. It is critical that we put this subject on the agenda. The Government must consider</p>
	<p pid="a.1361.0/18">how we can ensure that governors have the right skills and the right questions to ask of their head teachers and principals&#8212;of course, governors are also pivotal in further education. We must come up with a mechanism that ensures that there is strategic leadership and accountability at a local level in our schools through our governing bodies. Members can expect to hear much more from me on that subject over the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my third-floor Parliament street colleague and hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase>. It was a real education to listen to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>, who amply and ably demonstrated that it is possible to fit quite a lot into a short space of time. I am not at all surprised that wherever he goes he is greeted with flash-mob dancing. I hope that, as he moves around his constituency over the jubilee weekend, he meets many more flash-mob dancers. In the spirit of my hon. Friend, I want to raise some subjects of concern to my constituents and to pay tribute to some local organisations in Tamworth and the people who run them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/2">In the past few days, Members might have received a glossy letter from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme extolling its virtues and claiming that it has</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/3">&#8220;helped millions and paid billions to consumers with nowhere else to turn&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/4">That might come as a surprise to my constituent, Mr Bill Shackleford from Hopwas, who applied to the FSCS last November for restitution, having lost &#163;32,000 in a failed investment vehicle called Greenfield International. Mr Shackleford is retired and not well off. About 240 other people in the west midlands also invested money in Greenfield and lost it, and I believe they have also applied to the FSCS. I wrote to the FSCS on Mr Shackleford&#8217;s behalf, but after seven months, we have still heard nothing. It is still processing his compensation claim and has now outsourced it to Capita. I will be grateful if the Deputy Leader of the House can advise me and my constituents on how the FSCS may be encouraged to move a little faster and help more people to receive restitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/5">Another matter that, as Mr Speaker might say, has already been well ventilated in the House, but which I think needs further airing, is the exceptional hardship scheme for High Speed 2. It was set up in 2010 to help people who were in particular hardship and whose homes were blighted by the prospect of HS2 to move home. Recognition is growing that the scheme is not fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/6">Six of my constituents have applied to the EHS and been turned down for arbitrary and bizarre reasons. One constituent has been told that she was turned down because she does not have a pressing health need, despite the fact that she has a doctor&#8217;s certificate to say that she has a pressing health need to live in a bungalow and not in a farmhouse. She has been told that she has not reduced the value of her property sufficiently, even though she has reduced it by 20%. She has also been told that there is no proof that she is blighted by HS2, even though Green and Co., the local estate agent, has been told by potential buyers that the reason they are not buying her home is the prospect of HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/7">I must say that the Secretary of State for Transport has been helpful to me in this matter. I should also pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) and for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright), who have taken an interest in these matters. However, I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will use all his artistry and all his eloquence to prevail upon the Secretary of State and the Chancellor&#8212;we know that all power resides in the Treasury&#8212;to ensure that the enhanced hardship scheme, which is to replace the current scheme, recognises that people who have a reasonable desire and need to move ought to be able to move and to be helped if they cannot sell their homes. I hope that they will consider a property bond scheme, which is a fair, transparent and equitable way of ensuring that people can sell their homes and get the property market moving.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/8">I also want to pay tribute to an organisation in my constituency that helps soldiers. The Injured Soldiers Holiday Appeal does exactly what it says on the tin: it helps soldiers who have been injured and their families to go for a holiday&#8212;away from the hospitals, the clinics and all the hullaballoo&#8212;to help them to readjust to their new circumstances. My constituent Paul Mason, whose son is a serving soldier, set up the charity. He has already done a great deal to help 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment and Help for Heroes, and he has now set up this new charity, which is commendable. I trust that other Members will encourage their constituents with an interest in such matters to set up similar helpful charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/9">I also pay tribute to a growing organisation in my constituency, Community Caf&#233;. It was set up two years ago by Lee Bates, one of our local councillors, with Steve Hodgetts, Lisa and Andy Powers, Bernard and Carol Gee and others to span the generations and people&#8217;s backgrounds by providing a community caf&#233;, in a place called Wilnecote, where people could come and have a drink, a chat and some food. The kids can come as well&#8212;there is something there called a Wii, whatever one of those may be. The concept has grown throughout Tamworth. We now have a community caf&#233; in Belgrave fire station&#8212;our new, state-of-the-art fire station&#8212;and in Amington, and we have just set up another caf&#233; in the Torc vocational centre in Glascote. That is the sort of volunteering that all hon. Members</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/10">like to see in their constituencies. I pay tribute to those who have given up their time and money to make Community Caf&#233; in Tamworth such a success.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/11">I will end simply by saying that June is going to be a bumper month in Tamworth. We have the jubilee weekend: I shall be spending time in Stonnall, Little Aston and Fazeley, where I shall be attending a big jubilee lunch, along with other places around Tamworth. I am also looking forward to seeing the jubilee beacon being lit atop our SnowDome. If that was not enough, at the end of the month, on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-30">30 June</phrase>, the Olympic torch, which other hon. Members have mentioned, moves through Tamworth&#8212;the high point of its progress around the country before it arrives in London for the Olympics. I shall be there to cheer on the townsfolk of Tamworth, who will be cheering on the torch.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366.0/12">We have a wonderful sense of history in Tamworth. We have some wonderful facilities&#8212;the SnowDome, the castle, and the French and German markets. If any hon. Members, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are passing through Staffordshire in June, drop into Tamworth and bring your wallet with you. We will be pleased to see you.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1368.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" speakername="Bob Stewart" colnum="1368"  time="017:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001355">
	<p pid="a.1368.1/1">It is a real pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase>, who represents 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment. In the next few months, we are going to witness some spirited debates on what might be cut from the Army. They will be particularly important to those Members who might lose regiments in their own constituencies, so as a warm-up, I should like to explain my view of the regiments and the regimental system, and tell the House what they mean to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/2">We all know that the Army is designed to fight for us, if directed to do so by the Government. The way in which it is organised, and its esprit de corps, are crucial determinants of how it works when it deploys. The Army is obviously a martial profession, and none of us present will have any doubts about what might be the ultimate requirement for our soldiers. Napoleon correctly identified the morale of his soldiers as the crucial ingredient of their success. He called morale &#8220;the sacred flame&#8221;, saying that it mattered more than anything else. In that respect, he also insisted that</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/3">&#8220;morale is to the physical as three is to one.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/4">In short, high morale can compensate for many other deficiencies, including numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/5">I saw that when I had the privilege of commanding my regiment, 1st Battalion The Cheshire Regiment, in Bosnia during 1992 and 1993. Often in conversation with the commanders of the various factions and armies, I would be asked the same question: &#8220;How many men do you have under your command?&#8221; Obviously, I would not answer; instead, I would say something like, &#8220;Lots and lots,&#8221; but then I would ask them how many soldiers they thought I had. The answer was invariably between 3,000 and 4,000. In fact, I had 800. The point is that the soldiers of my regiment gave the impression that they were far more numerous than in fact they were. It was their esprit de corps, their morale and their regimental pride that gave that impression.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/6">Organisation and numbers are of course important to military success. The strategic defence and security review has determined that the Army is to be reduced in size, down to as few as 82,000 serving soldiers. Many definitions of an army suggest that 100,000 should be its minimum size, so what is the future for our Army? Some people have suggested that it might more correctly be dubbed a defence force. I shudder at that thought. One thing is clear: we are going to have to cut down some units from what the Army calls its teeth arms. Regiments, or parts of them, in the infantry and cavalry are going to be disbanded. All teeth arm units are formed into regiments, and we are likely to lose some historic and highly valued names.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/7">Quite rightly, the British Army&#8217;s regimental system is respected, and sometimes copied, worldwide, but what exactly is that much-rated regimental system? The term &#8220;regiment&#8221; started in Britain in the mid-17th century when retinues that followed a certain leader were organised into some form of standing military force. Such regiments were normally named after the colonel who commanded them. For example, my own regiment, which is now called 1st Battalion the Mercian Regiment&#8212;the old Cheshires&#8212;was first formed in 1689 on the racecourse at Chester. It was then called the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s Regiment. Later it became the 22nd Regiment, after its precedence in the order of battle, and later still it became properly linked to the county of Cheshire. A similar process happened to most of our great infantry regiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/8">Under this regimental system, each regiment became responsible for recruitment, training and administration. It developed its own style, which in turn derived strength and purpose from the regiment&#8217;s history and traditions. Even today, the colonel of each regiment still has the right to select his officers. In the past, and sometimes today, it was usual for a soldier&#8212;and many officers, too&#8212;to spend their entire careers within their own regiment. They frequently served with men they had known since birth. For example, at the time of the Ballykelly bomb in 1982, I was commanding officer of A Company 1st Battalion the 22nd Cheshire Regiment when six of my soldiers were killed, and over five days in mid-December 1982 I attended their funerals. All six were buried within the borders of the county of Cheshire. Amazingly, at these funerals, several mothers put their arms around me, saying that they fully realised my sorrow, too. It is because the regimental system is so emotive that it often seems like a family.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/9">In fact, infantry battalions take great pride in using the words &#8220;the regimental family&#8221;. That is literally true, as when I was commander, many soldiers in my regiment were in the fourth, fifth or even sixth generation serving in their family regiment. That sense of family is vital in battle. When they are very frightened, soldiers are often sustained by what they see as a greater fear&#8212;that of letting down their friends and their family. It gives them what I regard as another offshoot of the regimental system&#8212;the so-called &#8220;black humour&#8221; so often found among our soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/10">As the incident commander at the time of the Ballykelly bomb in 1982, I was devastated to find four of my own lance corporals together in a crumpled heap under tons of concrete. One had been killed immediately the bomb</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/11">exploded, another died shortly thereafter, a third lingered in agony for several hours, and the fourth was trapped by his legs on top of his dead friends. After four hours, the decision was made that he would have to have both legs amputated where he lay trapped by concrete&#8212;the threat of gangrene was growing and it might have killed him regardless. I told the badly wounded Lance Corporal William Bell, whose brother was also serving and whose family went back generations in my regiment, that we would have to cut his legs off. His incredible reply sums up what the regimental system is all about: &#8220;No legs Sir! One hell of a way to get out of the Pearson trophy tomorrow, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; The Pearson trophy was the regiment&#8217;s weekly cross-country run. All ranks do it and it is universally loathed&#8212;especially by someone like me! But that ruddy awful run was part of the regiment&#8217;s style and ethos.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368.1/12">The strategic defence and security review has directed that the Army is to lose perhaps four or even more battalions from Army regiments. In the next weeks and months, we in this House will be debating and arguing exactly which ones will be affected. Some have suggested that no regimental cap badge will be lost. They argue that so-called large regiments&#8212;formed in the past by pushing small regiments together into a new grouping&#8212;will remain. That happened to my own regiment last time, when the 1st Cheshires were amalgamated to become 1st Battalion the Mercian Regiment. The 2nd Mercians came from 1st Battalion the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment, while the 3rd Mercians were formed from the 1st Battalion the Staffordshire Regiment&#8212;from the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth. All those battalions within those regimental groupings keep their own regimental histories and their own pride, despite coming under the umbrella title of the Mercian Regiment. It might seem easy to cut, say, the 3rd Mercians or indeed the 3rd Royal Anglians&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="1371"  time="017:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001361">
	<p pid="a.1371.1/1">We have had an excellent debate. First, I want to pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the hon. Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase>, who gave a very eloquent and compassionate account</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/2">of the sudden and unexpected death from epilepsy of a 10-year-old child in her constituency. Her account of that tragic event moved us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase> is known for her expertise on international issues. She spoke about the women&#8217;s rights records of many countries in the middle east. In what was an excellent speech, she also outlined her continuing concern about the torture, imprisonment and suppression in Bahrain of those demanding democratic rights, and she talked about similar situations in other middle-east countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/4">There is a great deal of respect for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40301" name="Gareth Thomas">the Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase> for the work he does on business and industry. He talked about airport development in the south-east, and the proposal for an airport in the Thames estuary. His constituency borders Heathrow, so this issue is of great importance to him and his constituents. He gave an excellent speech, in which he made it clear that the ongoing debate about a Thames estuary airport is a distraction from the real issues concerning aviation and its potential contribution to economic growth in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> has long campaigned on issues relating to freight and the railway system. He talked about the plan for a freight route from the south to the north of England. In his usual enthusiastic style, he pointed to the logic in securing, in the medium or long term, a modal shift in our freight capacity away from the road network and on to the railways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> talked superbly about the potential impact on London of the Government&#8217;s housing benefit policy. He referred to the Mayor of London&#8217;s view that there is a real possibility that the poorest in London and housing benefit claimants will be pushed out to the suburbs, in effect achieving a separation&#8212;a ghettoisation &#8212;of the poor and the better-off in our great capital city.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/7">My hon. Friend also talked about animal welfare. I have worked with him on animal welfare issues. In the previous Government, he served as a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister with responsibility for animal welfare, and I can testify that he was an excellent Minister. I worked with him on dog control in particular, which is an ongoing campaign. Today, however, he talked about the labelling of meat to make it clear whether or not the animal was stunned. Leaving aside the religious issues, he made an excellent case for the labelling of meat and for clarity in respect of animal welfare standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/8">My hon. Friend also talked about the Olympics, as did a number of other Members. It is a great event, and there is mounting excitement. He mentioned the torch&#8217;s journey around the UK. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">The hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> rightly boasted about the Olympic torch being carried through his constituency. I will just put on the record the fact that the torch will be going through my constituency, when it will be carried in the great city of Sheffield by Lord Coe, who is a Sheffielder, and we are incredibly proud of that. The hon. Gentleman, with his usual charm, also put on the record West Ham United&#8217;s promotion and Chelsea&#8217;s victory last Saturday night. I wish to put on the record the promotion of the great club Sheffield Wednesday to the championship</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/9">this season; it is well on its way back to the premiership. I am sure that I will be standing here at the end of next season celebrating the promotion of Sheffield Wednesday to the premiership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> gave us a history lesson, informing us that Immingham&#8217;s name comes from a thane from the kingdom of Northumbria called Imma. I would like to inform the House that Grimsby, the neighbour of Immingham, was named after the legendary fisherman who features so strongly in the famous mediaeval poem &#8220;Havelok the Dane&#8221;. So it is now abundantly clear to the whole House that north Lincolnshire has been the centre of the universe in terms of mediaeval folklore and history, and that is something of which the hon. Gentleman is very proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40404" name="Iain Stewart">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart)</phrase> was incredibly moving in his tribute to Alan Turing. He got this afternoon&#8217;s debate off to a superb start, and I echo his sentiments about Alan Turing. Not long ago, I watched an excellent Channel 4 documentary about the life, the achievements and the tragedy of Alan Turing. It remains a stain on British justice that that man still stands convicted of crimes which, of course, now no longer exist, and we need to find a way of clearing his name and marking what he achieved for British history and for British industry and technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> was eloquent in his opposition to the caravan tax, and of course I congratulate him on putting himself so firmly on the record on the matter. I am sure that his constituents will carefully watch how he conducts himself on this issue in the House over the coming weeks and months. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase>, in a wide-ranging speech, talked about the importance of the aerospace and nuclear industries to British manufacturing and, in particular, to the north of England. He related that contribution to the importance of the supply chains in both those industries. He made particular mention of British Aerospace in the north-west, with its strong relationship with military manufacturing, and of the great significance of the nuclear industry to the north-west, with Sellafield in Cumbria. I can only echo his sentiments, given that both those industries are also crucial to the economic future of south Yorkshire. People will not realise that steel manufacturing is heavily involved here and is crucial to the aerospace industry. Most of the aircraft that fly over UK airspace probably have a tiny bit of my constituency&#8217;s manufacturing capability within them, because components for landing gear and for the Rolls-Royce engine are made in my constituency. So I can only echo my hon. Friend&#8217;s comments. Sheffield has a great ambition to be part of the supply chain for the nuclear industry, but its ambitions to develop that capacity were severely damaged&#8212;I make no apology for mentioning this once again&#8212;by the decision to cancel the &#163;80 million loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, which would have helped to secure the development of that very important supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/13">My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn also put on record the fact that there has been a 232% increase in unemployment in his constituency since 2010 and went on to describe the impact on his constituents of the continuing austerity programme set in place by the</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/14">coalition Government: the unemployment; the increase in the number of food banks; the pressures on and cuts to Sure Start, despite the fact that the Prime Minister says repeatedly that he understands the importance of investment in the very earliest years of children&#8217;s lives; and the increasing charges and pressures on adult social care services. The price we are paying for austerity is unacceptable. What is it achieving? Nothing but a double-dip depression made in Downing street.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/15">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr MacShane)</phrase> nailed that issue when he pointed out that today the ONS has once again downgraded the growth figures for the first quarter to minus 0.3%. He talked about the potential impact of the double-dip recession on the steel industry in his constituency, in mine and in all constituencies across the UK where steel manufacturing is dominant. Steel is obviously at the heart of most manufacturing processes&#8212;in construction, in aerospace, you name it, steel is at the heart of our manufacturing industry. My right hon. Friend talked about the lack of demand and about the pressures of costs, particularly energy costs. We could feel the passion with which he spoke about the manufacturing process and steel, and as the product of many generations of steelworkers I must say that people probably need to have it in their blood to understand the passion and excitement that can be generated by a big basket of scrap metal being fired up and converted into molten steel. As my right hon. Friend said, it is one of the most impressive sights that anyone is ever likely to see in manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/16">I want to comment, too, on the northern hub. It was mentioned earlier and it relates to our position as an economy and the Government&#8217;s handling of economic and investment matters. Earlier, it was claimed that the northern hub had been given the go-ahead. As I put on the record earlier, it has not. Let me quote what the Chancellor said in his Budget statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/17">&#8220;I confirm today that Network Rail will extend the northern hub&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/18">not complete it, not give it the complete go-ahead, but extend it&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/19">&#8220;adding to the electrification of the trans-Pennine rail route by upgrading the Hope Valley line between Manchester and Sheffield&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-03-21.797"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 March 2012; Vol. 542, c. 797</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/20">Network Rail has made it absolutely clear that that does not mean that the Hope Valley route is to be electrified and it is not the green light for the northern hub. We await that in the high level output specification statement, which we hope will be made later in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/21">Once again, the Chancellor gave the impression through his Budget speech that he was doing one thing when he was doing another. He was slipping through, creating the impression that he was doing more than he was. We had other examples in that Budget of measures that he would rather we did not know about: the granny tax, the caravan tax and the pasty tax. It was a desperate Budget built on desperate measures by a Government who do not know how to deal with the fact that they have a double-dip recession on their hands that they have created and that they do not know how to climb out of. The Government only know plan A, they do not recognise the importance of plan B and the electorate is becoming increasingly disenchanted with their economic record, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371.1/22">I pay tribute to the speech made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>. She spoke movingly about breast cancer and its impact on women&#8217;s lives. She pointed out that the previous Government&#8217;s investment has improved survival rates for women with breast cancer, with eight out of 10 women still alive after five years, but that we still have a long way to go. It is important to have earlier detection and diagnosis and the increased and consistent use of advanced radiotherapy techniques across the country if we are to have the kind of NHS that the country really needs. The point that my hon. Friend was making was that there is no sense among Opposition Members that the health reforms delivered in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which passed through the House only a few weeks ago, will help us to deliver the approach to health that we need, with prevention of disease, early diagnosis and effective early treatment when people fall ill. Nothing in the Act will help to advance those very important agendas. The best way of reducing demand for expensive health care is to prevent ill health in the first place, but that legislation will not deliver that approach to health in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1375.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" speakername="David Heath" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Secretary, Office of the Leader of the House of Commons"  colnum="1375"  time="017:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001362">
	<p pid="a.1375.0/1">Yet again, we have seen the value of these free Adjournment debates. I was very disappointed that we did not have one before the Easter recess and I am particularly pleased to have secured this one. I greatly welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> to the Backbench Business Committee and even though he has not quite joined yet, he allowed the Committee to take the credit for this debate. Actually we put it on, because the Committee has not yet started its work this Session and I am glad that we have given Members this opportunity to raise important issues about their constituencies or more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/2">I want to correct what seems to be a widespread misapprehension among colleagues on both sides of the House about the Olympic torch. They seem to think that the highlight of its journey will be its visit to their constituency whereas the highlight has already passed, this Tuesday, when it went to my constituency. It entered and went around Somerton&#8212;I was there&#8212;and then left my constituency. That was a highlight. But then the Olympic torch relay organisers realised that my constituency was too good to leave and the torch came back into Frome later on the same day, so we had another marvellous occasion. I know that all Members will welcome the event when it happens in their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/3">Let me quickly go through hon. Members&#8217; various contributions. I know that I cannot do justice to all the speeches and answer all the questions that have been raised, but I will make sure that hon. Members have a proper reply from the relevant Department to any questions that I cannot answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/4">We started with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40404" name="Iain Stewart">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart)</phrase>, and I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase> that he made a moving and valuable contribution to the debate. We should recognise the huge contribution that Alan Turing made to our country&#8217;s future and our security during the war. The centenary of his birth is an appropriate time at which to do that. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, a posthumous pardon was considered in 2009, and as a result the then Prime Minister made an</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/5">unequivocal apology for the treatment that Mr Turing had received, which the then Prime Minister accepted was horrifying and utterly unfair. I think we all believe that those successful prosecutions and convictions for what should not have been a crime would have been cruel and deeply inappropriate for anyone, but particularly for someone who had served the country so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/6">The hon. Gentleman knows that there are difficulties with providing a posthumous pardon and Lord Sharkey has raised this issue in the context of legislation in another place. We know that those particular offences are now to be disregarded for those who were convicted and are still alive, but there is currently no mechanism for doing that for others. However, discussions continue and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join Home Office Ministers in looking at whether there is a way of achieving that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">The hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> raised a number of issues. I thought he might have expressed a little more pleasure about the fact that a brand-new &#163;1.6 billion contract had just gone to BAE Systems. I would have thought that that was worth celebrating, but it seems not. He also raised other matters that are properly for the local authorities in his area. One of the things the Government are keen on is to make sure that responsibility lies where it should&#8212;with locally elected members for the decisions they take. I have no idea whether Lancashire county council is fulfilling its responsibilities, but if not, those elected to the authority are answerable to their electors. That is the right way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/8">I was a little surprised by what the hon. Gentleman said about early years investment. The Government have actually invested a lot more money in early years. We have built on the previous provision and I am pleased about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/9">The one thing I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with is his comment about rural broadband. He chose the wrong Minister when he said that rural broadband did not matter, and that it was just faster internet shopping for millionaires. I am sorry, but it is not. If we do not invest properly to allow every member of every community in the country to have access to broadband, we shall have failed. The hon. Gentleman is deeply mistaken on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase> talked about development on the green belt in her constituency. She knows the Government&#8217;s position; it is clearly set out in the national planning policy framework. It might be useful for her to have a conversation with the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>. He is the Minister for decentralisation, so he can explain exactly what Government policy is and perhaps communicate that to local authorities in her area. I will happily arrange that meeting if I possibly can.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" name="Ann Clwyd">The right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase> raised a number of human rights issues&#8212;in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Burma and Syria. She was joined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40301" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase> who talked about Sri Lanka and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> who spoke about Bangladesh. We must never forget the importance of human rights or the influence that Britain can and should bring to bear in countries around</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/12">the world. That is very much an emphasis both for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development in everything we do in those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/13">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> talked about the beauty of his constituency and pointed out that it attracts a lot of tourists. At one point, it sounded as though he was listing all the songs that have extolled the beauty of places in his constituency. He made the very valuable point that many Government policies are supportive of small businesses, and he is absolutely right about that. I would also refer to tourism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/14">My hon. Friend raised what he saw as the difficulties in correcting the anomalies in relation to static caravans. He knows that the Government have extended the consultation period, and that in due course they will come forward with a view based on the consultation. There is nothing wrong with correcting anomalies, but as we all know, sometimes when we correct them we introduce new ones. We have to take all the evidence and then come to a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">The hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> talked about breast cancer, and I agree with the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge that she did so movingly. It is pleasing that survival rates are now better, and if we can reduce the level of mortality from all cancers, and certainly from breast cancer, it will be a significant step in the right direction. One of the keys to that is early diagnosis. The hon. Lady talked about the extent to which early diagnosis in the borough of Newham lags behind that in some other parts of the country, and that worries me. One of the benefits of the new legislation is that it brings local authorities who know their area well into the issue of public health and they may be more responsive to the needs of local inhabitants than the health authorities, which were rather more remote. I hope that will improve provision in her area. I also accept what she said about the new, less-invasive therapies that are available. That is something the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence must take on board; that is why we have that independent advice for medics on the most appropriate types of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/16">We heard a very moving contribution from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase>, who talked about her constituents, Mr and Mrs Burns. I am sure that all Members of the House will want to extend their sympathy to them and to Isabella for the tragic loss of Charlie. Let us be clear that deaths from epilepsy are not common. With unexpected deaths, one of the problems is that it is often very hard to understand what signs and symptoms people should be looking for. Public awareness is critical, so I was pleased by what she said about the charity that is working to extend public awareness about sudden death from epilepsy and that fact that nocturnal seizures are one of the signs that people should look for. I think that she did a marvellous job in raising the issue today and hope that people will hear what she has to say. I know that the Department of Health will do everything it can to back that up with information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/17"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40301" name="Gareth Thomas">The hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase> talked about the custody suite in Harrow police station, and I understand his point about the loss of custody suites. One of the knock-on effects is that we lose the</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/18">police officers, who are arresting officers, who must then transport people somewhere else and so cannot police the streets. He talked about the proposal for an airport in the Thames estuary. We await the consultation on the aviation industry and the consequences of that. I know that many people are not persuaded of the virtues of such an airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/19">The hon. Gentleman also talked about something very close to my heart: London Welsh. I played against London Welsh a few times when I was with Saracens and always enjoyed my visits to Old Deer park. I understand why they would be miffed at the idea that, if they beat the Cornish Pirates&#8212;it is not necessarily the case that they will&#8212;they cannot then progress. The rules are a matter for the Rugby Football Union, but it is important that, literally, there is a level playing field between those in the premiership and those who aspire to be. I will draw his comments to the attention of the Minister for Sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/20">Appropriately, we then moved on to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40510" name="Mark Pawsey">the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey)</phrase>, who talked about graduated driver licensing. I am pleased that he recognises that the introduction of the drug-driving legislation will be an advance. He knows that he is yet to persuade the Department for Transport of his case, but I know that he will be persistent. What we need is an evidence-based approach to whether graduated driver licensing would succeed in reducing injuries and accidents, particularly for young drivers, which is something the whole House wishes to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/21"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" name="Denis MacShane">The right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr MacShane)</phrase> talked about steel, and I recognise and understand much of what he said. I just wish that he had not then lapsed into caricaturing the positions of member of the Government on that. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills is made in Yorkshire and knows perfectly well what heavy industry is about. The right hon. Gentleman might have mentioned the fact that the blast furnace at Redcar steelworks, which was closed under the previous Administration, has been reignited under this Government. That might have made his contribution a little more balanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/22">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" name="Bob Russell">the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)</phrase> talked about Israel and Palestine, a cause he has been so committed to for so long. He knows that the Government&#8217;s position is to support a two-state solution in which both Israel and Palestine can live in security and peace. That is what we need to achieve, and it is not assisted by illegal settlements or some of the activities he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/23"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">The hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> seemed to advocate a very exciting scheme, and I hope that the business case stacks up, because a modal shift from road to rail for freight is extremely important. I do not why he singled out Scotch whisky as its main cargo, as there are probably other uses, but it was a useful contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/24"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">The hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>, with the breadth of his contribution, gave his usual bravura display on such occasions, from the art of happiness to the cultural centre of Essex, which I am advised is certainly not an oxymoron under any circumstances. He ranged over online publications and the pay of chief executives in the public sector, and he knows that the Government are very much bearing</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/25">down on the salaries that are within our control, but the same should apply in particular to local authorities, where there is concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/26">The hon. Gentleman talked also about his local police authority&#8217;s lack of engagement with him, which as a former chairman of a police authority I found very surprising. He also referred to clamping, on which he knows we have introduced new legislation that will take effect this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/27">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Vioxx, a matter that is still before the courts, and he talked about his constituent Mrs Stephanie Lister and the drugs, such as Ritalin, that are used on young children. He will know that the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a significant initiative to improve mental health facilities for young people and to find better therapies for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/28">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Maldives, and his constituent Stephanie Migliorini and the award that she won. As always, he covered a great deal of ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/29"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40634" name="David Mowat">The hon. Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)</phrase> talked about changes to private sector pensions and came up with a scheme that would save the Government, he told us, millions and millions of pounds. Anything that saves the Government millions and millions of pounds is something that we want to consider very carefully, and although I do not feel qualified to give an opinion, I shall ensure that somebody who knows the subject much better than I do gives him a reasoned response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/30"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">The hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> talked about the Olympics, which must be a matter of huge excitement in his constituency, and the need for further Thames crossings. As someone who has always lived in east London when in London, I recognise what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/31">The hon. Gentleman talked about the sensitive issue of animal slaughter, and we need to look further at it. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is doing that to see how it can sensitively reconcile animal welfare with religious practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/32">The hon. Gentleman talked about leaseholder rights. He also talked about rabies&#8212;and thank goodness it has not been a problem in this country for so long. If there are ways of reducing its incidence abroad so that we maintain the safety of not just our citizens but others, that would be worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/33">The hon. Gentleman also discussed housing benefits, and I understand his point. It is a concern that has been expressed on both sides of the House, and we must get it right, so that we do not give huge amounts of money&#8212;well beyond what a household on normal earnings can possibly achieve&#8212;to people. Nevertheless we understand that when we are talking about families, we are talking about people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/34"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> talked about Immingham, and we learned a little about its early history, but he talked about its development plans, too. I had not really appreciated that Immingham and Grimsby are, as a complex, the largest port in the UK, and that is a declaration of ignorance on my part, but I did know that the area has enormous economic and strategic importance, so the way in which we maintain its infrastructure&#8212;whether its development plans, road connections, broadband or all the things that he mentioned&#8212;is enormously important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/35"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590" name="Neil Carmichael">The hon. Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael)</phrase> talked about manufacturing and engineering and pointed out that they are not just oily-rag trades nowadays. It is so important to our future economic success that we attract the brightest and best to engineering and manufacturing, because of not just the initial product, but the supply chains that he mentioned, which affect my constituency as well in terms of aerospace, in particular, and avionics. He welcomed the energy Bill and also the things that we are doing to try to attract young people to the world of industry and bring them into it through the apprenticeships scheme and similar measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/36">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman talked about school governance, and I look forward to hearing more from him on this subject. We put an enormous amount of work the way of governors, who have an enormous responsibility on their shoulders. All the help that we can give them represents money well spent in enabling them to do their job in the best way possible as that is so crucial to our schools and colleges across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/37"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> tried to upset me by suggesting that people travel through my constituency only to get to his. Of course, the better class of people do not&#8212;they stop in Somerset, as he well knows. I know where he comes from, and so I know where his heart really lies, but I understand that he has to say these things because he is now in foreign parts in Devon. He talked about the importance of agriculture and about agri-tourism. We used to dig for victory and then forgot how to, but we now have to remember again because food security is so desperately important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/38">I was fascinated by the community caf&#233;s mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the hon. Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase> and by his injured soldiers holiday appeal. He raised two rather more negative matters regarding his constituents&#8217; inability to get satisfaction in claims on failed investments and on blight by HS2. I will contact the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary of State for Transport and hope that we can resolve those outstanding issues for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/39"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">The hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> talked about the regimental system and its importance to esprit de corps. I have always been very attached to the idea of cap badge loyalty. I have some experience of this, not in the armed forces but in the police, where I always felt that it was important to be able to identify with the body in which one served. In Somerset, we regret the fact that the Somerset Light Infantry is no longer a regular Army regiment. I think the fact that we have no Army footprint in my county has been detrimental to recruitment. The hon. Gentleman drew on his own experience and his distinguished record, and I know that he will be heard by Defence Ministers, who have not yet reached their conclusions about the final structure and deployment of the Army but are working on that at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/40">Last but not least, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase> talked about the importance of the Commonwealth. I entirely agree. It is wonderful that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are currently mounting guard on Horse Guards parade; it is the first time that a non-military unit from another Commonwealth country has done so. It is not in my gift to arrange a debate on Commonwealth day each year; that is in the hands of the Backbench Business Committee. However, if he</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/41">applies to the Committee and it thinks it a good idea, the Leader of the House and I will do everything we can to assist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/42">We have had an excellent debate in which Members have managed to cover a huge range of subjects. I will make sure that those whom I have not answered properly get replies from the Departments involved. I hope that Members are able to use this short Whitsun recess effectively in their constituencies, but also to celebrate, as several of them said, the jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen. I have seen people&#8217;s enthusiasm for the Olympic torch, and the amount of red, white and blue bunting around our constituencies at the moment is terrific. It makes for a jollier place, and I welcome it. I wish you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and all the staff of the House a pleasant short break, after which very brief period we will resume business as usual.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/43" class="italic">Question put and agreed  <i>to</i> .</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/44" class="italic">Resolved ,</p>
	<p pid="a.1375.0/45">That this House has considered matters to be raised before the forthcoming adjournment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1383.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="1383"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0003.htm#12052457001368">
	<p pid="a.1383.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend, who is quite right. I know that other colleagues met Mr Ali when he was here. He is right also to mention the links that there have been between this country and Bangladesh for many years. We have supported it when it has been through problems such as drought and floods. I hope that that in difficult circumstances, that relationship will offer our Government an opportunity at least to press the Bangladeshi Government on the current issues. The huge Bangladeshi population in the UK and its contribution to our society warrant our taking those issues seriously and doing whatever we can to highlight them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/2">Some of the Bradford-based business people and entrepreneurs from the Bangladeshi community have said to me that they want to go back to Bangladesh and invest there, but feel that their ability to do that is being threatened. Surely that must be a concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/3">I acknowledge that many colleagues have raised concerns about the situation in Bangladesh, and the specific case of Ilias Ali, with the Minister. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40187" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Bedford have both done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/4">I do not want to get into giving out blame, but some people are blaming the paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion for the disappearances and killings. The RAB was formed to tackle corruption and organised crime, but it is</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/5">increasingly being linked with political abductions and, worse still, political assassinations. I hope that we can get to the bottom of that, because it is causing concern. I do not want to point the finger of blame, but the RAB has been mentioned a number of times when people have raised the issue with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/6">Tonight&#8217;s debate is about trying to find out what routes our Government can take. I know that it is difficult for them, but I ask the Minister to highlight what action they have taken so far to raise the matter with the Bangladeshi Government, what diplomatic pressure can be brought to bear and what further action our Government can take.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/7">I particularly urge that political and diplomatic pressure be brought to bear to achieve the following. First, we need to establish the immediate whereabouts of Ilias Ali and Ansar Ali, in the hope that their safe return to their families can bring some stability to the current crisis. We need to establish the whereabouts of the other activists who have disappeared, as identified by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. We need to try to find a way to get a truly independent inquiry into the recent deaths of protesters and an immediate end to the forced disappearance of political activists, and we need to help the Bangladeshi Government and others re-establish the rule of law and freedom of expression and respect the independence of the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.3/8">It is estimated that there are 500,000 Bangladeshis living in the UK, and I know that the Minister will appreciate how concerned that community is about the situation that is developing in the country. I hope that he can assure them that the UK will bring to bear whatever pressure it can to ensure a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384.0/1">I join the thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe)</phrase> for securing the debate, and I thank him for his kindness in giving up time so that others may speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/2">I met Ilias Ali for the first time six years ago, and I last met him in Sylhet 14 days before his disappearance on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-18">18 April</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman talked about the larger political issues, but I would like to talk on more of a personal level. I am greatly saddened by Ilias Ali&#8217;s disappearance and greatly frustrated by the Government of Bangladesh&#8217;s inability to identify what has happened to that Member of Parliament. Like many other Members, I call on our Government to do as much as they can.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/3">I wrote to the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-17">17 April</phrase> and was grateful to receive his reply. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/4">&#8220;There are a number of possible explanations for the disappearance of Mr Ali. Bangladesh law enforcement and security agencies have strenuously denied in court that they hold Mr Ali. This is why we have called for a full investigation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/5">Like the hon. Member for Bradford South, I would like to hear from the Minister what progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/6">When I met Ilias Ali, we talked about two things, the first of which was his concern for the safety of others involved in politics&#8212;it was the day on which one of the youth leaders in Sylhet for the Bangladesh Nationalist party had disappeared, and Mr Ali was holding a press conference. The second thing he talked about was his idea for the future and the recognition that a new generation of Bangladeshis wanted a Government who understood the true meaning of democracy and who</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/7">were prepared to support the growth of enterprise and freedom in their country, to enable it to break out of the cycle of poverty that marks much of its past.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/8">In that spirit, I ask the Government to demand of Bangladesh the same standards of democracy that we expect here, and not to assume that democracy can be held to a lower standard in other countries because that might have happened in the past. Ilias Ali was not only a Member of Parliament, but an incredibly important member of his party and a major hope for many Sylhetis, both those whom he had represented and those in the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/9">On the policy side, I urge the Minister please not to treat this situation as business as usual in our dealings with Bangladesh. Please will he keep this matter on his board of importance and look at what our Government can do? I can only pray for the safe return of my friend; I hope the Minister can press for more urgent action.</p>

	<p pid="a.1386.2/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40109" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe)</phrase> not only for securing this important debate, but for how he introduced it. I commend to any friend of Bangladesh the comments made by him, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40380" name="Gavin Shuker">the hon. Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker)</phrase> for how they characterised their support for Bangladesh&#8212;not partisan, but based on a knowledge and affection for the country and a respect for their constituents of Bangladeshi origin and how the latter feel about their own country. The way they put their concerns is a model for those outside of how both sides of the House can deal with a difficult issue, recognising its huge sensitivities. I hope that I do not fail to live up to the way in which they set out the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.2/2">The hon. Member for Bradford South described the incident and the responses to it, and rightly set out the difficult background. It is not an isolated incident, and</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.2/3">it is drawn not from a background of enormous political stability, but from difficult circumstances in which personalities often overshadow the issues that need to be dealt with. Hon. Members were honest in not pointing the finger of blame in a situation where the circumstances are still unknown. They recognised, however, that even though the circumstances are unknown, people need to know, because a healthy democracy and society need to move away from a culture of disappearances and similar incidents. The hon. Gentleman set out the matter very clearly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.2/4">I shall first deal with the incident concerning Mr Ilias Ali and then say something about our relationship with Bangladesh generally and what we hope to do for a country that is special to the United Kingdom. I share the House&#8217;s concern about the disappearance of Mr Ali, an organising secretary for the Bangladesh Nationalist party and former MP for Sylhet, who has been missing since <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-17">17 April</phrase>. We understand that his abandoned car was discovered by police in the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-18">18 April</phrase>, close to his home in Dhaka. Mr Ali&#8217;s driver is also missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.2/5">Colleagues were interested to know what we have done. The British high commission in Dhaka has been in regular contact with members of the Bangladeshi Government and the Bangladesh Nationalist party in the weeks since Mr Ali&#8217;s disappearance. In meetings with the Prime Minister&#8217;s office and senior officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have made representations to the Government of Bangladesh urging them to do all they can to locate Mr Ali and to investigate the circumstances of his disappearance. Hon. Members may be aware that during a press conference on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-09">Wednesday 9 May</phrase>, our high commissioner to Bangladesh and ambassadors of eight other European countries called on the Bangladesh authorities to conduct thorough investigations into disappearances, including that of Mr Ali. We do not know who is responsible. That is why we have pressed for the most rigorous inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.2/6">At my request, FCO officials have provided me with a list of more than 20 meetings and phone calls made in the last month in connection with this incident. In addition, I will be visiting Bangladesh in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1387.0/1">Before the Minister says what he may be doing and asking for when he goes to Bangladesh&#8212;which I am pleased he is doing&#8212;can he tell the House whether the Government have offered the Bangladesh Government support from our police in investigating the disappearance of Mr Ilias Ali? If that has not happened, will he offer that support, and if it has, can he say what the Bangladesh Government&#8217;s response has been so far?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-24a.1388.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="1388"  time="018:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120524/debtext/120524-0004.htm#12052457001377">
	<p pid="a.1388.0/1">I would be grateful if, in accordance with the trust that colleagues accorded me at the start of the debate, my hon. Friend left me to make a judgment when I am there dealing with the authorities. It is clear to me&#8212;not only from the comments of colleagues in this debate, but from the letters I have received from a number of Members of Parliament and the comments made by members of the Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom&#8212;that there can be no doubt among the authorities there about the great concern aroused not only by this case in itself, but by its context, given other cases. That allows me, I think, to have a frank discussion with the authorities, as well as with representatives of all the political parties in Bangladesh, about the issues; but for now, perhaps I might be given the opportunity to make a judgment about more practical support when I am there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/2">Colleagues will know that, as has been mentioned, opposition parties responded to the disappearance of Mr Ali with a programme of public demonstrations and hartals, which are enforced general strikes. In associated violence, sadly, a number of people have died. Since then, some 33 members of the Bangladesh Nationalist party have been arrested for an alleged arson attack. There are accusations that the arrests were politically motivated. Colleagues who have studied the situation in Bangladesh over many years will recognise that a lot of personal and historical baggage drives that country&#8217;s political discourse. We will not speculate about the identities of the victims and perpetrators in this series of unfolding events. What I will say&#8212;I am reinforced in this by the comments that all colleagues have made&#8212;is that we regard this form of politics as a problem. It is in Bangladesh&#8217;s interests that its politics be practised primarily in Parliament, not in the streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/3">Hon. Members have rightly raised broader concerns about human rights in Bangladesh. We welcome the Bangladesh Government&#8217;s assurances that they are committed to protecting human rights, and I recognise that progress has been made across a range of social development indicators. However, I note that reports, including from Bangladeshi human rights organisations, continue to suggest high levels of disappearances, abductions, extra-judicial killings and torture. The Foreign Secretary himself raised our concerns when he met the Bangladesh Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-16">16 April</phrase>. Such issues are a standing item in our discussions with the Bangladesh Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/4">Improving human rights, democracy and the rule of law are also integral parts of the United Kingdom&#8217;s development assistance programme in Bangladesh, which includes projects to support access to justice, to improve political participation, and to promote accountable and transparent government. To give one example, over the past five years we have supported the establishment of 20,000 community police forums, enabling access to more equal and fairer police services for 5 million people. UK support over the next three years should increase access to community-led legal services from 35% to 50%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/5">During my forthcoming visit to Bangladesh, I expect to meet the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to see some excellent UK-funded projects and to meet young people with high aspirations. That is the positive side of our relationship with Bangladesh. I shall also take the opportunity of my visit to raise the difficult subjects that have formed the core of our debate today. I plan to use my visit to better understand Bangladesh and to discuss with the country&#8217;s political leaders what it would take to make sustained progress on human rights and ensure that the country is on a path to free, fair and participatory elections by early 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/6">We have a strong, broad and long-standing relationship with Bangladesh, which is important to both countries. We were the first European country to recognise Bangladesh, and, as colleagues have already mentioned, some 500,000 people of Bangladeshi heritage live in the United Kingdom. We are also the largest cumulative investor in Bangladesh. Given this close and multifaceted relationship, it is right that we should look at Bangladesh&#8217;s problems, a number of which have been highlighted in today&#8217;s debate, and conclude that it is all the more important that we engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.0/7">Colleagues have mentioned that Bangladesh is a young democracy and that its standards need to be high. I agree with both those statements. There is no doubt that democracy is struggling there because of the country&#8217;s historical baggage. It is therefore essential that we give our total support to those who are engaged in promoting democracy and working hard in the most difficult circumstances.</p>
