	<p pid="d.655.5/1">The Chancellor announced extensions to public sector pay restraint in the autumn statement 2011. That will impact on armed forces pay. However, my right hon. Friend announced no further changes in relation to pay in the 2012 Budget, but he did announce the doubling of council tax relief for personnel on operations; the doubling of the families welfare fund to support the families of those deployed; and an additional &#163;100 million of spending to improve accommodation for service personnel and their families. In addition, the lower-paid members of the armed forces are benefiting from the changes to taxation announced in the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="d.656.1/1">There is all-party concern about forces&#8217; pay during the Olympic games. The Secretary of State is right that there is no exact comparison with other workers, but the country has noticed that London bus and train drivers are getting Olympic bonus payments and that our forces are not. What contact has he had with G4S about it paying bonuses to troops who are called up at the last minute? I do not begrudge the transport workers their bonus, but just because troops rightly cannot go on strike, they should not be ignored by the Government.</p>

I am in discussion with senior members of the armed forces about how best to do that.</p>
	<p pid="d.656.2/2">The Government do not have a direct contractual relationship with G4S&#8212;the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games holds that relationship&#8212;but I can assure the right hon.

	<p pid="d.656.4/1">This strays slightly wide of the original question. I explained the week before last, I believe, the reason why the decision was taken not to look at removing a Gurkha Rifles battalion&#8212;the arrangements we have with the Sultanate of Brunei for the rotation of battalions would have broken down and been inoperable had we removed one of the two battalions.</p>

There continue to be credible reports of significant quantities of weapons&#8212;particularly rockets&#8212;being smuggled into Gaza. The UK recognises that Israel has legitimate security concerns and that the people of Gaza are suffering at the moment, which does not serve Israel&#8217;s long-term security interests.</p>

	<p pid="d.663.0/1">I am glad to say that I find that SMEs are often particularly energetic in pursuing overseas opportunities. Indeed, many British small defence contractors begin their commercial lives exporting, rather than selling to the domestic market, which is a great tribute to the enterprise they show.

However, I attach the greatest importance to the establishment of the suppliers&#8217; forum for SMEs, which I chair, and which enables us to pursue in detail both the concerns of SMEs and the issues we have in dealing with them. That is a very fruitful discussion, which is leading to a radical simplification of the way in which we do business with SMEs, and in due course it will create many more opportunities for them.</p>

Of course, Thales is the prime example of an excellent company doing first-rate work in Northern Ireland; I visited it earlier this year, seeing for myself just how good that company is, and it makes a huge contribution through the supply chain. The small and medium-sized businesses of Northern Ireland can also contribute to other contracts throughout the United Kingdom, and I am sure they are doing so in a realistic and strong way.</p>

However, in headline terms, the analysis conducted by the Chief of Defence Mat&#233;riel on the comparative benefits of changing Defence Equipment and Support into either an Executive non-departmental public body with a strategic partner from the private sector or a Government-owned contractor-operated entity suggests that the strategic case for the GoCo option is stronger.

It has also considered regional and national affiliations, the merger and disbandment history of individual battalions, and existing commitments of battalions to future operations.

	<p pid="d.677.2/1">Since I updated the House on Olympic security last week, there have been several allegations in the media, and I want to deal with each of them.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/2">First, it was reported that Ministers knew there would be a shortfall in security staff last year. This is untrue. Last September, Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary reported, at my request, on the security preparations by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, and it recommended several measures. HMIC reported again in February and concluded that LOCOG had plans in place to deliver the required number of security personnel. Neither HMIC report identified specific problems with G4S scheduling.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/3">Secondly, it was reported that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40466" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)</phrase>, who is the Minister for crime and security, had attended meetings in which he was told there was a security staff shortage. In fact, G4S repeatedly assured us that it would overshoot its targets. As I told the House on Thursday, G4S told the Government that it would be unable to meet its contractual obligations only last Wednesday, and we took immediate action.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/4">Thirdly, it was reported that we must have known about the shortfall because the military was put on standby in April. This is also not the case. In fact, 7,500 troops have been part of the security plans since December, a further 1,000 were on standby in the event of flooding or other such civil emergencies, and we placed a further 2,000 on standby as a precaution in case the threat level increased. The 3,500 troops whose deployment I announced last Thursday are a direct response to the failure of G4S to meet its contractual obligations. A further contingency will remain.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/5">The Government have strengthened the oversight of the security planning operation since we came into office. I will go through briefly what has happened since the bid for the games in 2005. From the beginning, the organisers planned to use private sector personnel for venue security. LOCOG confirmed that it would be using private sector security personnel well before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It started the procurement process for security personnel in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/6">When we entered government in May 2010, we instigated a comprehensive review of Olympics safety and security planning, overseen by the then Security Minister, Baroness Neville-Jones. That audit and review identified a shortfall in LOCOG&#8217;s venue security budget, which we addressed in the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/7">We recognised that, with a project of this size and scale, even that additional funding might not ensure the level of security that we needed, so I asked for outside assurance of LOCOG&#8217;s venue security planning. In September 2011, I commissioned HMIC to carry out an inspection of LOCOG&#8217;s venue security plans. As I have said, that led to several recommendations that were acted on by the Home Office, the police and LOCOG.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/8">LOCOG and the Home Office monitored delivery throughout the following months. G4S assured LOCOG and the Government continually that it would be able to deliver its contractual obligations. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-11">Wednesday 11 July</phrase>, following the difficulties with scheduling that the company has acknowledged, G4S notified LOCOG and the Government that it would not be able to provide the numbers of security personnel specified in its contract. I want to be clear that that was the first time that G4S admitted to any Minister that it would not be able to deliver the numbers of security personnel that it had promised.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/9">We acted immediately to make further contingency arrangements by agreeing the deployment of 3,500 further troops. That brings the total military contribution to the games to 17,000, including personnel from all three services.</p>
	<p pid="d.677.2/10">G4S has failed to deliver its contractual obligations, but we have the finest military personnel in the world&#8212;troops who are willing, ready and able to step in when their country calls&#8212;and we can be sure of their professionalism in helping to deliver a secure and safe Olympic games.</p>

	<p pid="d.678.0/1">Everyone wants the games to be an outstanding success. After the G4S shambles, we need things to be back on track and the Home Secretary needs to show that she is sorting it out.</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/2">First, will the Home Secretary tell us precisely how many people she now expects G4S to provide? It was contracted to provide 17,000, it now says that it will be 13,000, but it has admitted that the vast majority of those are still in process. Today, we learned that only a third of the expected G4S staff turned up to lock down a venue in Manchester and that the police had to do it instead. The monitoring has failed once spectacularly and the Home Secretary has failed to assess the numbers once before. Will she now tell us how many staff she believes G4S will provide?</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/3">Secondly, the Home Secretary told us on Thursday that 3,500 extra troops would be sufficient to fill the gap. If G4S fails to deliver the full 13,000 people it now promises, will those troops be enough? If more troops and police will be needed, she should say so now and not let this drift. The troops and the police will do an excellent job, but they need to be able to prepare.</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/4">Thirdly, the London Mayor said this morning:</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/5">&#8220;Everybody that was organising the Olympics knew this was coming up&#8230;ages ago.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/6">The deputy mayor said:</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/7">&#8220;This issue was flagged up repeatedly by both the Metropolitan Police Authority and subsequently the Mayor&#8217;s Office&#8230;for more than a year to G4S directly, the Olympic Security Board, and the Home Office.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/8">Even G4S says that it has been discussing the detailed shortfall for &#8220;eight or nine days&#8221;. And yet, last Monday, the Home Secretary told the House that she was</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/9">&#8220;confident that our partners will deliver&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-09.9"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 July 2012; Vol. 548, c. 9</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/10">It is incomprehensible that the monitoring was that poor that no one told her until Wednesday. How on earth could the Minister responsible for delivering Olympics security be the only person who did not know? When was she first told that there was a problem with G4S?</p>
	<p pid="d.678.0/11">We need to know why the Home Secretary has failed on this, because we need to have the confidence that she understands what went wrong and is competent to sort the problem out now, so that everyone can get on and make the Olympics a great success.</p>

	<p pid="d.679.2/1">The very first figures that I gave were 10,400 G4S guards, 7,500 military, 3,000 Bridging the Gap, up to 3,000 volunteers and up to 2,000 incumbent security suppliers at existing venues. <i>[Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> asks, &#8220;Bridging what gap?&#8221; Bridging the Gap is the name of a programme under which students and others can get employment.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/2">The shadow Home Secretary says that we need to get a grip, but that is precisely what we have been doing. When we came into office, we made an immediate security audit, increased the budget and revised the plans. I have commissioned several reports on Olympic preparedness, each of which has led to a refinement of the plans. When G4S told us last Wednesday that it would be unable to deliver its contractual obligations, we decided to deploy extra military personnel to fill the gap.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/3">The right hon. Lady asked why the situation was not known about earlier. I have explained that we commissioned reports on G4S&#8217;s preparedness, which contained recommendations on which LOCOG, the Home Office and the police acted, but those reports all made it clear that subject to acting on those recommendations, LOCOG was on track to deliver the necessary security personnel. Last Wednesday, G4S told us that it would be unable to deliver its obligations.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/4">The shadow Home Secretary asked about timing. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-06">Friday 6 July</phrase> the managing director of G4S Global Events told Reuters:</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/5">&#8220;We are delivering a London Olympics now. If there was a similar event going on in Australia, I would be bullish that we could deliver that at the same time.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/6">I suggest that the right hon. Lady listens to the comments of some of her colleagues. The noble Lord West has said:</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/7">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will affect the security of the games. That&#8217;s been taken care of. The Government have sorted that out, because the military are in there.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/8">The shadow Olympics spokesman has said:</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/9">&#8220;The important thing now is to focus on the solutions.&#8221;</p>

It may be of interest to the House to know that the accreditation process has accredited more than 20,000 G4S personnel. The problem for G4S has been allocating personnel to particular venue security tasks through its scheduling programme. It was when it examined that situation and saw the difficulties it was having that it came to the Government last Wednesday and said that it could not meet its full contractual obligation.</p>

The public have confidence in our police service but no confidence in G4S, yet the Home Secretary has spent &#163;4 million promoting privatisation of essential police services, the principal beneficiary of which would be G4S. In light of the Olympics debacle, will she now abandon her reckless plans?</p>

	Rail Investment
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.687.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40490" speakername="Justine Greening" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="687"  time="016:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0001.htm#12071613000780">
	<p pid="d.687.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on rail investment. This Government have always been clear that our overwhelming priority is rebuilding our economy and restoring economic growth, to enable this country to compete in the global marketplace in the years and decades ahead. Just as we are dealing with the budget deficit, so we are determined to deal with the massive infrastructure deficit that we inherited. That is why we have taken the deliberate decision to prioritise significant investment in our transport infrastructure&#8212;not only in Thameslink, Crossrail, High Speed 2 and hard-shoulder running on motorways, but in relatively small interventions that make a big difference, such as tackling pinch points on our motorway network.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/2">The huge growth in passenger numbers over the last decade or more demonstrates how much people and businesses value and rely on our railway system. The numbers speak for themselves. Last year, passengers made 1.5 billion journeys, and the number of passenger miles travelled was almost 50% higher than in 2000. Rail freight operators carried 100 million tonnes of goods last year, with freight moved up by more than 15% over the same period. To help to meet that rapidly rising demand, we have already committed to the biggest rail modernisation programme since the Victorian age, with more than &#163;18 billion of rail investment in this spending review period alone, including in High Speed 2 and Crossrail.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/3">Today, I can announce that we are increasing that commitment, with a further &#163;16 billion of public support for the classic rail network between 2014 and 2019, which will support more than &#163;9 billion of enhancement in line upgrades, greater capacity and more electrification. The high-level output specification that I am publishing today sets out my vision for the railway in 2019, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Department for Transport officials and the rail team who have worked with me on that project.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/4">My vision is for a railway that is cheaper, greener and more reliable to run, that supports economic growth and that delivers for its passengers and freight customers. Passengers are at the heart of that vision, which is about delivering the capacity so that passengers can get to work; helping people and business to get between our cities faster; getting more freight off our roads and on to our railways; and improving access to our ports and airports. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the many MPs who have represented their community needs to me as I have developed the package.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/5">At the heart of the high-level output specification is a rolling programme of electrification to deliver more powerful, more sustainable and more efficient trains for passengers and to allow freight operators to use electric trains to haul longer loads at lower cost. Today, I am asking the rail industry to create a new electric spine for freight and passenger services from the south coast to the east and west midlands and south Yorkshire. That electric spine will include the electrification of the midland main line to Sheffield, which will dramatically improve passenger services between London, the midlands and Yorkshire. It could cut journey times by up to 13 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/6">It will include overhead electrification between Southampton and Basingstoke, which will be a pilot for possible wider replacement of the less efficient third rail system in the wider south-east.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/7">I am also delighted to announce that my Department and the Welsh Government have agreed on a proposal for the electrification of the valleys lines into Cardiff and for the completion of the electrification of the Great Western main line to Swansea. That is fantastic news for people in south Wales. I have worked closely with the Welsh Government and the Secretary of State for Wales, who has tirelessly made the case for investment in Wales, and I expect that investment to help to unlock significant economic and employment opportunities in some of the most deprived parts of Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/8">This is the largest programme of rail electrification that this country has ever seen. The previous Government electrified just 10 miles of railway, but we have now set out plans for more than 850 more miles of electrified railway. By the time that is completed at the turn of the decade, on current estimates, three quarters of all rail journeys in England and Wales will be made on cheaper, greener and more reliable electric trains. With the number of rail passenger journeys expected to increase by 16% over the period, I am also asking the rail industry to provide capacity for 120,000 more commuters into London and over 20,000 more into regional cities.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/9">Inter-city rail travellers will also benefit from new investments. Those benefits will include the completion of the northern hub project in Manchester; a &#163;240 million investment in capacity and connectivity improvements for the east coast main line, benefiting communities from the home counties to the north-east; and a further &#163;300 million for high-value, small-scale schemes in other parts of the country. That is on top of the improvements to which we have already committed ourselves, including faster journeys from London to Scotland and Wales through the inter-city express programme, and across northern England from Liverpool to Newcastle through electrification of the north trans-Pennine line.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/10">Passengers also want better transport access to international gateways. As I told the House on Thursday, I am asking Network Rail to develop a new western access rail link to our hub airport at Heathrow. I am also asking for improvements in the vital freight route to Felixstowe port through line and junction upgrades at Leicester, Peterborough and Ely. That will give a significant boost to the rail freight industry, which forecasts a 23% increase in demand by 2019. I am providing &#163;200 million of new funds to support the development of the freight network in order to meet that increased demand.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/11">I know that, for passengers, railways are often more about stations than about carriages and track. The HLOS programme that I am announcing today will benefit stations at Bristol, Huddersfield and Oxford, and will recognise the value of smaller-scale station schemes by providing further funds for the Access for All and national stations improvement programmes, both of which have delivered excellent results for rail users in recent years. I also know that not everyone can get to a station easily, and that a number of local communities have long wanted to see a new station in their area. I am making &#163;20 million available initially, and asking Network Rail to launch a competition inviting bids for new stations now.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/12">Vital though that massive programme of investment is, there is another equally important programme that we must deliver to ensure that our railway remains affordable. Sir Roy McNulty&#8217;s review identified inefficiencies in our rail industry worth up to &#163;3.5 billion a year. I assure the House that I remain committed to eradicating those inefficiencies, and to sharing the benefits with passengers and taxpayers. Alongside HLOS, I am publishing the funding that I will make available to enable the railway to operate over the period. The settlement is necessarily challenging: it assumes that the industry will deliver the important reforms set out in my March Command Paper and that the benefit will be returned to us all, whether we are passengers or taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/13">That builds on the reforms that we are already making to rail franchises, with longer contracts and more flexibility for operators to innovate in the interests of passengers. We recently published the invitation to tender for Essex Thameside, and I expect to announce the Great Western ITT shortly. I also expect to announce the award of the next west coast franchise over the summer. Today I am publishing revised guidance for the Office of Rail Regulation, which has statutory responsibility for Network Rail&#8217;s efficiency, stressing the importance that I&#8212;along with passengers and taxpayers&#8212;attach to efficiency and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.687.1/14">Today&#8217;s announcement represents another historic landmark in the regeneration and modernisation of Britain&#8217;s railways. It represents a recognition that investment in HS2 must not be at the expense of investment in the existing network, and it shows that the Government&#8217;s vision for the railways is clear: a railway system that is faster, more reliable, less crowded and more green. Today we are taking real steps to make that happen by delivering on our commitment to deficit reduction through a more efficient railway, recognising our commitment to High Speed 2 by developing the railway and preparing it for integration with the new line, and supporting our economy by bringing people and jobs closer together. That is our vision, that is our priority, and I commend it to the House.</p>

They were announced by the last Government, but they will have to be delivered by the next one. We were promised &#163;9 billion of new investment, but, as we have heard today, the reality is a plan for just &#163;4.2 billion of new rail schemes over five years&#8212;less than half the amount that was spun to the media in advance of today&#8217;s statement to the House. Of the rest&#8212;the other &#163;5.2 billion&#8212;more than half is simply confirmation that schemes already under way will not be cancelled halfway through, including Crossrail, Thameslink, the electrification of the Great Western main line, and the electrification in the north-west and across the Pennines, all schemes announced by my noble Friend Lord Adonis as Secretary of State for Transport in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/3">Even many of the supposedly new projects which make up the remaining &#163;4.2 billion are not so new after all, such as electrification of the midland main line, for which development of the economic case was announced by Lord Adonis, and to which we committed at the last election. Today&#8217;s U-turn on the Great Western main line is an acceptance that we were right to commit to completing electrification all the way to Swansea, a decision the Secretary of State and her predecessor have spent two years saying had no business case or economic benefit, when it plainly did. I welcome that U-turn; it is a victory for the Labour Government in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/4">It is right for the Government to commit to completing the northern hub. That is vital to improve connectivity and capacity between our northern cities. However, instead of that being promised for after the next election, we could have made further progress with the scheme in this Parliament. However, the Government chose to cut investment in this spending period by &#163;1.2 billion, according to Network Rail&#8217;s latest delivery plan update for the current control period, CP 4. It says that that has led to deferrals to CP 5, the period covered by today&#8217;s announcement. So we have cuts in this Parliament replaced by promises for the next. As the Select Committee on Transport has discovered, the entire northern hub could have been funded this year just from the Department&#8217;s underspend, but the Secretary of State instead chose to hand that money back to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/5">We have also had confirmation today that the Government are determined to press ahead with hiking rail fares by up to 11% in each of the next two years, on top of January&#8217;s fare rises of up to 13%. The misery for passengers is not to stop there: we discover from the tender documents for the new franchises that bidders are being assured they can then go on imposing eye-watering fare rises of up to 8% every year. That means more than a decade to come of investment-busting fare rises.</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/6">Will the Secretary of State confirm how much lower investment in enhancement schemes, greater capacity and electrification will be in control period 5 than in control period 4? Can she confirm when work will begin on the ground, actually delivering jobs from each of the schemes that have yet to get under way? Will she update the House on the significant delays in completing the contractual negotiations for Thameslink rolling stock and the inter-city express programme? Will she confirm that she has approved a cut in the planned order of new inter-city trains from 1,400, as planned by Labour, to fewer than 600?</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/7">When will we see the results of the review into train procurement that was promised following the fiasco of awarding the Thameslink contract to a company that will build the trains in Germany? With long-term youth unemployment having trebled in the last year, what steps are the Government taking to ensure that young people benefit from the investment through apprenticeships and jobs? Will the Secretary of State confirm that Network Rail&#8217;s debt, now standing at &#163;27 billion, is set to increase to &#163;33 billion by the end of this control period? How much will that have risen to by the end of 2019, as a result of today&#8217;s announcement?</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/8">On Network Rail, will the Secretary of State join me in condemning the decision to again propose a bonus scheme that will see senior managers handed &#163;300,000 each, apparently because they have said they will walk away if they do not get it, and then a wider bonus</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/9">scheme that could cost taxpayers &#163;11.7 million? Can she confirm that, as she threatened last time, she will turn up to this Thursday&#8217;s annual general meeting and vote against that package, and if not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/10">In light of the commitments made to improve rail links to Heathrow, when will the aviation industry actually be allowed to submit evidence to the Department on the country&#8217;s medium-term and long-term aviation capacity needs, or do we have this lack of joined-up policy making because we are awaiting the next Government reshuffle?</p>
	<p pid="d.689.0/11">Finally&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.691.0/1">Order. We are extremely grateful to the hon. Lady, but she has now well and truly had her time. I have been watching the clock very closely, the Secretary of State was within time and we must now move on. The Secretary of State will respond and then we will take Back Benchers.</p>

	<p pid="d.691.1/1">I have to say that many people watching this will be amazed at the hon. Lady&#8212;rather than looking at the glass 95% full, she seems to be looking at it 5% empty. The bottom line is that the Labour Government had 13 years to crack on with this, so if they did not get to do it, they have only themselves to blame. We are in government and we are taking our opportunity to improve our railway system for our people.</p>
	<p pid="d.691.1/2">I am delighted that it is a coalition Government who have finally delivered on that programme of transformation for the Welsh railways. It will make a huge difference to the Welsh economy, and I am delighted that we have been able to announce it today. I can assure the hon. Lady that we are looking at whether we can advance some elements of the investment earlier&#8212;of course we are. In fact, that comes on the back of a huge amount of work already under way across the industry, be it the work happening at Reading station, Peterborough station and Birmingham station, which is having a huge refit; the work on Crossrail and Thameslink; or the work we have just finished at St Pancras.</p>
	<p pid="d.691.1/3">The hon. Lady talked about the inter-city express programme, and we are making good progress in those negotiations. She will be aware that, as and when Hitachi is able to start building those trains, it will open a brand new depot in the north-east, which will create several hundred jobs. I very much hope that it will be the beginning of a story for that region in the coming years that mirrors the one people have seen in the automobile industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.691.1/4">The hon. Lady asked about apprenticeships and jobs. Network Rail is playing its role in developing a skilled British work force through recruitment and development. It is taking on 200 new apprentices annually on a three-year programme, and there is now a graduate programme in place, which took about 150 people in 2011. It is also funding an industry-wide track and train programme to give opportunities to unemployed graduates, offering three six-month placements with different organisations. I got to meet some of those graduates earlier this year, and it was outstanding to see them and the opportunities they have been presented with. So a huge amount of effort is already going on in the industry. Today&#8217;s announcement will complement that and give the industry the pipeline for the future which will allow</p>
	<p pid="d.691.1/5">it to invest not only in its own companies, but in the supply chain that we so badly need to make sure that that work can be supported.</p>
	<p pid="d.691.1/6">The hon. Lady asked about Network Rail bonuses. Well, you know what, I am the first Secretary of State for Transport who has ever expressed an opinion on them, so I do not need to take any lectures from the ex-Government, who set up Network Rail and then proceeded to spend the whole time complaining about how it ran itself. It is putting in place its new governance structure, which will be a more responsible one than that set up for it by the Labour Government. It beggars belief that, on a day when we announced such an historic investment, all the Opposition can do is carp from the sidelines. However, I suspect that while that is their strategy they will remain exactly where they are now: on the sidelines.</p>

	<p pid="d.692.2/1">Over the past two years Network Rail has announced losses of &#163;344 million on its very large derivatives book, so would not a better way of spending that money be to have a national programme to replace dangerous level crossings with bridges and underpasses&#8212;and could that start in Wokingham, please?</p>

	<p pid="d.692.4/1">This is a welcome investment announcement, but it appears to be based on the industry finding an as yet unidentified &#163;3.5 billion of savings.

	<p pid="d.692.5/1">I believe that the savings will be found. We have a work programme in place and for the first time the industry has come together. Sir David Higgins, when he appeared at the hon. Lady&#8217;s Committee recently, committed to reducing his costs base by 20% and said that he was keen to go further. I believe that we have a plan in place to work with the industry. Critical to that is not constantly reorganising it, as it is time for it to stay where it is and work together better.</p>

	<p pid="d.693.0/1">I commend the Secretary of State for her statement. The upgrade and electrification of the midland main line will be hugely welcome in Kettering.

	<p pid="d.693.1/1">There will be a variety of upgrades of junctions, tracks and capacity. One key aspect of today&#8217;s announcement is the removal of some of the bottlenecks that often stop passenger trains going as fast as they can. Many of us will have been on a passenger train while it travelled at what seemed to be quite a slow pace. That is often because it is stuck behind a freight train. A number of the smaller improvements we are making today will mean that that happens less and that will be one of the things we can do to improve my hon. Friend&#8217;s line.</p>

	<p pid="d.693.2/1">It would be churlish not to welcome the fulfilment of a Labour pledge to electrify the midland main line and to make the associated improvements. Will the Secretary of State tell us exactly when those improvements and the electrification will begin?</p>

	<p pid="d.693.3/1">The improvements will take place over the 2014 to 2019 period, as the project is developed and rolled out. I have worked hard to ensure that Sheffield has a good transport package from the Department. Another thing that I managed to get sorted out, which the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Government never did, was &#163;3 million for a footpath bridge over the railway line, which will mean that his community and others around that area can get into Sheffield from the other side of the railway track. I believe that that, alongside the midland main line scheme and the capacity changes, means that by 2019 he will see a much better service.</p>

	<p pid="d.693.5/1">Absolutely it does.

I have no doubt that we will continue to look at whether those options are available to us and we can progress them.

Interestingly, on the &#163;500 million project that we are taking ahead for that western rail access to Heathrow, more than 90% of the benefits will go directly to businesses, so it is a real catalyst for growth in the Thames valley area.</p>

It is now for the industry to go away and look at how it can achieve the outcomes that we are specifying. The midland main line electrification is one of the key, explicit schemes that we have said we want to bring forward. If the industry has a proposal to do it faster than the timeline that we have mentioned, I have no doubt that we will be very interested in looking at it.</p>

	<p pid="d.700.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we worked closely not only with the Secretary of State for Wales but the Welsh Assembly Government. I met Carl Sergeant a few times to discuss these proposals. As regards how the financing will work, the basic scheme for the valleys is &#163;300 million. That is funded through track access charges that franchise operators will pay. It pays them to do this, because they save money through electrification, which reduces their operating costs. Once the valleys electrification has been completed, that, in essence, will electrify the line to Bridgend, which means that the final piece to Swansea becomes worth doing. It also simplifies our rolling stock procurement.</p>

	<p pid="d.703.3/1">It is too early to say exactly what will be specified in the franchise contracts, but many of the investment proposals that we have put in place today, which the industry will come back to us with more detailed versions of, allow the potential for more frequent services. I know that that is exactly what communities such as my hon. Friend&#8217;s want. We are building headroom for growth into the railway network for the communities that need it.</p>

The north Wales coast line and the line west of Swansea are vital links between the mainland and Ireland, which is a major trading partner of the Welsh economy and the wider UK economy.

It will be massively important for local economies and for jobs and growth. Its effect will go well beyond the rail industry, for example by connecting up airports and ports. My hon.

Today&#8217;s investment in electrification will be a key part of that as well.</p>

At Defence questions, the Secretary of State announced that he was going to lay a written ministerial statement tomorrow on the future of Defence Equipment and Support&#8212;the equipment arm of the Ministry of Defence. He said that a decision had been taken to run the organisation by a Government-owned, contractor-operated model. This decision has been the subject of debate, delay, review and speculation over the last two years. In the light of how important this matter is&#8212;not only to those working in the defence sector but to many Members&#8212;is it right for it to be announced through a written ministerial statement rather than an oral statement and on the last day before the House rises for the summer recess, as it denies us the opportunity to scrutinise this very important decision?</p>

	<p pid="d.710.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move</p>
	<p pid="d.710.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House regrets the growing gap between Ministers&#8217; statements and what is happening in the NHS; notes mounting evidence of rationing of treatments and services by cost, despite Ministers&#8217; claims to have prevented it; further regrets the increasing number of cost-driven reconfigurations of hospital services, despite the Coalition Agreement&#8217;s promise of a moratorium on changes to hospital services; further notes growing private sector involvement in both the commissioning and provision of NHS services, contradicting Ministers&#8217; claims that the NHS reorganisation would not increase levels of privatisation; recognises that, according to the Government&#8217;s Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses figures, actual Government spending on the NHS in 2011-12 fell by &#163;26 million, the second successive real-terms reduction in NHS spending, following a reduction of &#163;766 million in the Government&#8217;s first year in office, in breach of the commitment in the Coalition Agreement; believes the Government&#8217;s decision to reorganise the NHS has distracted its focus from the financial challenge, with seven out of 10 acute hospital trusts in England missing savings targets in the first half of 2011-12; calls on the Government to take action to prevent rationing by cost in the NHS, based on the evidence presented; and further calls on the Government to honour pledges on NHS spending in the Coalition Agreement, and the commitment that future savings will be reinvested into the NHS front line, and to return at least half of the underspend to the Department of Health budget.</p>
	<p pid="d.710.2/3">The year 2011 was the first full year of the coalition Government and the year of the biggest ever fall in public satisfaction with the national health service. As I shall set out, those two facts are not unconnected. The NHS in England is reeling from the Government&#8217;s catastrophic decision to reorganise it at a time of huge financial pressure. Warnings by Opposition Members and others during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 of a postcode lottery, of destabilised hospitals and of increasing privatisation are, sadly, beginning to materialise.</p>
	<p pid="d.710.2/4">For the coalition, attention has moved to other battles&#8212;more pressing priorities&#8212;but for the NHS the moment of greatest danger is now, as the unstoppable force of reorganisation hits the immovable object of the financial challenge. That is why the Opposition make no apology for introducing this debate, or for bringing the House&#8217;s attention back to where it should be: our country&#8217;s most important public service and the struggle it faces.</p>
	<p pid="d.710.2/5">I am grateful for the Secretary of State&#8217;s letter&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I can hear him mumbling away on the Government Front Bench. I would have thought the debate would justify his attention, as it justifies that of the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>. The Opposition have introduced this debate to support NHS staff. We thank them for what they do. They have a huge capacity to deal with whatever is thrown at them, but they have been set mission impossible by the Government. One can only wonder how they felt on hearing the news that the Deputy Prime Minister had the chance to stop this reorganisation but chose to prioritise House of Lords reform. A million hearts will have sunk.</p>

	<p pid="d.711.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman will know that the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee said that productivity fell continuously for a decade under the previous Government.

	<p pid="d.711.1/1">I am afraid the hon. Gentleman is out of date, because the figures cited by the Government are wrong. NHS productivity was improving by the time Labour left office. The independent and authoritative Commonwealth Fund pronounced the NHS the most efficient health care system in the world in June 2010. That was the legacy of the Labour Government, which the Conservative party is putting at risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.711.1/2">As I have said, it was not just the decision to reorganise that was wrong; the way the Government have gone about it is also wrong. Before the ink was dry on their White Paper, Ministers set about dismantling existing NHS structures before the new ones were in place. That is a dangerous move at any time, but disastrous at a moment of financial crisis.</p>
	<p pid="d.711.1/3">We have therefore had drift in the NHS: a loss of focus at local level and a loss of grip on the money just when it was most needed. At a stroke, the Government demoralised the very work force who would be crucial to managing the transition, with primary care trust managers dismissed as worthless. Experienced people left in droves. Those who stayed hoping for jobs in the new world were issued with scorched earth instructions: &#8220;Get on and do the unpopular stuff now&#8212;the rationing and the reconfiguration&#8212;so the new clinical commissioning groups don&#8217;t have to.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.711.1/4">We can now see the consequences across England: brutal, cost-driven plans for hospital reconfiguration being railroaded through on an impossible timetable without adequate consultation; walk-in centres being closed left, right and centre; and people left in pain and discomfort, or facing charges for treatment, as PCTs introduce restrictions on 125 separate treatments and services.</p>

	<p pid="d.711.2/1">On the subject of brutal closures, did my right hon. Friend have a chance to look at the authoritative report by David Rose in <i>The Mail On Sunday</i> yesterday about the &#8220;Beeching-style&#8221; closure of major casualty units? Four out of nine of the units to be closed are in west London, leaving my constituents and 2 million people in west London without adequate health cover.</p>

	<p pid="d.711.3/1">I have no idea how Ministers expect west London to cope with service reductions on that scale, nor do I know how they square them with the moratorium on hospital closures and changes which they promised at the last election.

	<p pid="d.712.1/1">My hon. Friend makes his point powerfully. With some reconfigurations there is a clinical case supporting change, such as the changes I introduced in London before the last election to improve stroke services. We reduced the number of centres from 12 to eight. That was a difficult decision for many London Members at the time, but it was the right thing to do because lives are being saved. However, there is a world of difference between those changes and the crude, cost-driven reconfigurations in the NHS that those on the Government Benches said they would not allow.</p>
	<p pid="d.712.1/2">I spent my weekend reading a very entertaining book entitled &#8220;Never Again? The story of the Health and Social Care Act 2012: A study in coalition government and policy making&#8221;. It is a very interesting book and offers a new, detailed account, by Nick Timmins, of the Government&#8217;s NHS reorganisation&#8212;or, as it says on the blurb, the inside story of a &#8220;car crash&#8221;. I particularly enjoyed the quotation from the Minister of State&#8212;I gather that he has not read it, but there he is, up in lights at the very beginning of the book. He made this comment about the then Bill, which the author thought worthy of special attention:</p>
	<p pid="d.712.1/3">&#8220;You cannot encapsulate in one or two sentences the main thrust of this.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.712.1/4">He should know that better than anybody, as he toured more media studios than anybody, and used more sentences than anyone, in a vain attempt to sell the technocratic and dense plans that made sense to his boss and nobody else.</p>

	<p pid="d.712.2/1">Given that the biggest strain on most health authorities is staff pay, does the right hon.

Does Labour not regret allowing doctors to be paid more for doing less?</p>

	<p pid="d.712.5/1">In a moment.</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/2">What I found most useful about the book is that it answered a question that has been nagging away in my mind for some time. As a former Health Secretary, I remember clearly the warnings I received from senior</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/3">civil servants about the sheer scale of the &#163;20 billion efficiency challenge. &#8220;It would be a major undertaking,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The NHS would need to focus all its energy on that alone. To be negotiated safely, new policy initiatives would have to be put on hold.&#8221; Over the months that have followed, I have often had cause to recall those words, as I watch the Secretary of State add to the financial challenge with the biggest ever reorganisation in NHS history. Did the same civil servants issue the same apocalyptic warnings to the incoming Secretary of State as they did to me? Finally I have my answer, in a quotation in the book from an unnamed senior civil servant:</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/4">&#8220;The biggest challenge was trying to get the secretary of state to focus on the money&#8212;the &#163;20 billion and the sheer scale of the financial challenge&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/5">According to that civil servant, however, the Secretary of State&#8217;s attitude was:</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/6">&#8220;I am going to do these reforms anyway, irrespective of whether there are any financial issues. I am not going to let the mere matter of the financial context stop me getting on with this&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/7">Another civil servant is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/8">&#8220;We did point out to him that his plans were written before the big financial challenge, and didn&#8217;t that change things? He completely did not see that at all. He completely ignored it&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/9">Then the question is asked: was the Secretary of State presented by the Department with alternatives to inflicting legislative upheaval on the NHS? A senior civil servant said that</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/10">&#8220;it was clear that having posed the question of did he want to see other options, that Andrew was not very interested at all in us presenting alternatives.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.712.5/11">A picture is emerging of a Secretary of State with an inability to listen, take advice or heed warnings, who is going to have his Bill regardless of the upheaval that it will cause to the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="d.713.1/1">At the heart of the defective legislation that the Government rammed through the House of Commons is an unresolved conflict of interest, in which commissioners can also be providers who can remove services from hospitals and then provide them themselves. Under pressure in the other place, the Government came up with a requirement for a statement of such interests, but without introducing any mechanism for enforcement to ensure that decisions in the NHS are being made for the right reasons. I fear that that conflict of interest will return to haunt the Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.715.2/1">No, it does not. This is what Government Members do not understand. It is not about the organisations, but about the services that they provide. The existing organisations can be asked to work differently, and I would ask them to work differently. I do not want NHS organisations to be in outright competition, hospital versus hospital; I want them to work collaboratively. So yes, we will repeal the Act, but no, there will not be a pointless top-down reorganisation of the kind that we have seen the Secretary of State inflict on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.715.2/2">This complacency is dangerous, and it cannot be allowed to continue. We had two clear purposes in initiating today&#8217;s debate. First, although we cannot stop the Government&#8217;s reorganisation, we can hold them to account for promises that they made to get their Bill through. I shall shortly identify five such promises in respect of which we are asking Ministers to live up to their words. Secondly, we wanted to give the House a chance to help the NHS by voting to hold the Government to account and enforcing the coalition agreement&#8217;s commitments on NHS spending.</p>
	<p pid="d.715.2/3">Let me first deal with Ministers&#8217; claim that there is no evidence of rationing of treatments by cost. They have promised to act if any evidence is presented. In fact the evidence is plentiful, and it is simply not credible for Ministers to deny it. The postcode lottery of which we warned is now running riot through the NHS. We have identified 125 separate treatments that have been stopped or restricted in the past two years, in some cases in direct contradiction of guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.</p>

	<p pid="d.716.8/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the waste of money the Government have brought into the NHS through this reorganisation. The total is over &#163;3 billion. That is simply unjustifiable at this time. Staff who had been working in primary care trusts are either being re-employed as consultants or are going</p>
	<p pid="d.716.8/2">into clinical commissioning groups. This is such a waste of money at a time when the NHS needed every penny to maintain standards of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="d.716.8/3">I was talking about rationing, and let me focus on cataract surgery. <i>GP</i> magazine has found limits on cataract surgery in 66% of PCTs. The Royal National Institute of Blind People found that 58% of PCTs are using visual acuity thresholds to restrict surgery. This is the evidence, so the Secretary of State had better start listening. What has happened since those restrictions on cataract operations have been introduced? Unsurprisingly, the number of cataract operations in England fell by over 12,000 between 2010 and 2011. That is a direct result of the new restrictions. There is no less need, however. Thousands of older people need such procedures, but they are now being forced to live with very poor sight.</p>
	<p pid="d.716.8/4">This is truly a false economy. Cataract surgery is one of the most cost-effective procedures carried out by the NHS. It helps people live independently and have a quality of life, and research has shown that in the last two years poor vision has been a factor in 270,000 falls by people aged 60 or over. This is the rationing by cost that Ministers have repeatedly denied is happening. So let me ask the Secretary of State again: does he agree with these restrictions on cataract surgery? If he does not, will he take immediate action to lift them?</p>

My right hon. Friend says the staff made those improvements, but so did he. As the incoming Secretary of State, he made improvements to waiting times for cataract surgery, which, if I remember rightly, were commonly about a year in the late-1990s. We brought those waiting times right down. Now what do we hear? We hear that under this crowd people with two cataracts are being told, &#8220;You can have one done, but not both.&#8221; That is what the NHS has been reduced to under this Government.

	<p pid="d.717.1/2">The second area on which the Government need to be challenged is privatisation. As the debate on the Bill drew to a close, the Secretary of State made this clear statement:</p>
	<p pid="d.717.1/3">&#8220;The legislation is absolutely clear that it does not lead to privatisation, it does not promote privatisation, it does not permit privatisation and it does not allow any increase in charges in the NHS.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-03-27.1335"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 March 2012; Vol. 542, c. 1335</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.717.1/4">It is hard to know where to start, but how about the NHS walk-in centre in Sheffield, which is managed by a private company and has just started charging patients with whiplash injuries &#163;25 for treatment, or the NHS</p>
	<p pid="d.717.1/5">hospitals now marketing private treatments for in vitro fertilisation, cancer screening or bone screening since the cap was lifted? How about the letter sent to all PCTs requiring them to identify three or more services for tendering under the &#8220;any qualified provider&#8221; measure in 2012-13? How about the 100 or so tenders for a range of services that have been offered to the private sector on this Secretary of State&#8217;s watch, with a total value of more than &#163;4 billion? So let me ask the Minister and the Secretary of State today: will they now at least be honest about their true intentions for the level of private sector involvement in the NHS?</p>

	<p pid="d.718.1/1">This is really important; it is where all of what the Government are doing comes together. They have put in place restrictions in treatments&#8212; 125 separate treatments, as I have just mentioned&#8212; and at the same time they have given a 49% cap to NHS hospitals to do more private work. So as the NHS decommissions services, hospitals are then free to start offering those services. That is why my hon. Friend is beginning to see the changes that she is noticing, and this is the clear agenda of the Conservative party.</p>

That was the intention of the Bill that they brought through; they wanted an unfettered market in the health service, and my hon. Friend is absolutely right.

	<p pid="d.718.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-28">28 June</phrase>, in response to misinformation put out by Labour councillors, the medical director of my local hospital trust, a doctor of 30 years, wrote an article in my local paper under the headline &#8220;NHS faces greatest challenge&#8221;. She talked about staff costs, treatment costs and the 2008 Nicholson challenge. She said that the trust&#8217;s problems date &#8220;back to 2008&#8221;, and she continued:</p>
	<p pid="d.718.4/2">&#8220;Having been a doctor for nearly 30 years, the 2008 Nicholson challenge is, by far, the greatest challenge the NHS has ever faced&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="d.718.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is making my point; if he was listening to what I said at the start of my speech, he would have heard me say clearly that</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/2">the &#163;20 billion Nicholson challenge, which I set, was always going to be a mountain to climb for the NHS. Let us be clear that it was. What was unforgiveable was combining that Nicholson challenge with the biggest ever top-down reorganisation in history, when the whole thing was turned upside down, managers were being moved or made redundant and nobody was in charge of the money. That was what was so wrong, and that is what the hon. Gentleman should not be defending if he is defending staff in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/3">The third area where we need action from Ministers is on protection for staff. The Deputy Prime Minister said recently:</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/4">&#8220;There is going to be no regional pay system. That is not going to happen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/5">But we heard yesterday that a breakaway group of 19 NHS trusts in the south-west has joined together to drive through regional pay, in open defiance of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are looking at changes to force staff to take a pay cut of 5%; to end overtime payments for working nights, weekends and bank holidays; to reduce holiday time; and to introduce longer shifts. We even hear that if staff will not accept this, they are going to be made redundant and re-employed on the new terms. So let us ask the Secretary of State and the Minister to answer this today: do the Government support regional pay in the NHS and the other moves planned by trusts in the south-west? If they do not, will they today send a clear message to NHS staff in the south-west that they are prepared to overrule NHS managers?</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/6">Fourthly, I shall deal with reconfigurations. The House will recall the promise of a moratorium on changes to hospitals and the Prime Minister&#8217;s threat of a &#8220;bare-knuckle fight&#8221; to resist closure plans. In 2010, the Secretary of State set out four tests that all proposed reconfigurations had to pass. They related to support from general practitioners, strengthened public and patient engagement, clear clinical evidence and support for patient choice. He said:</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/7">&#8220;Without all those elements, reconfigurations cannot proceed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/8">So let me ask the Minister: does he think that the A and E units closing at Ealing, Hammersmith, Charing Cross and Central Middlesex pass that test? How about St Helier, King George, Newark and Rugby? Is it not clear to everyone that the Prime Minister&#8217;s bare-knuckle fight never materialised? Is it not also clear that no one told the Foreign Secretary, the Work and Pensions Secretary or even the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)</phrase>, who is responsible for care and older people and who has launched a campaign against his own Department? What clearer sign could there be of the chaos in the Department of Health and of the chaos engulfing the NHS? Will the Secretary of State now take action to stop reconfigurations on the grounds of cost alone?</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/9">That brings me to my fifth and final area for action, which is NHS spending. The coalition agreement said:</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/10">&#8220;We will guarantee that health spending increases in real terms in each year of the Parliament.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/11">That is health spending, not the health allocation. Official Government figures show that actual spending has fallen for two years running and the underspend has been clawed back by the Treasury. Of all the promises the coalition has broken, people will surely find that one</p>
	<p pid="d.718.5/12">the hardest to understand given that the Prime Minister appeared on every billboard in the land, on practically every street in the land, promising to do the opposite just two years ago.</p>

What I will not do&#8212;what I will never do&#8212;is go to marginal constituencies, as the Secretary of State did, and make false promises that I will reopen such units. The Secretary of State did that before the last election; no wonder he is looking shifty in his seat right now. He went to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituency and said that he would reopen that unit. Has he done that? I do not believe that he has.</p>

	<p pid="d.720.3/1">I do not know how the Secretary of State justifies what has been done. Even in my own patch, Greater Manchester was going through a children&#8217;s and maternity services review and some constituencies were benefiting from the changes&#8212;Bolton, for example, was getting a bigger maternity unit&#8212;but some were not and this Secretary of State went both to Bury, where he said that he would defend the maternity unit, and to Bolton, for a photo call celebrating the new investment. If anything illustrates the sheer opportunism of the Secretary of State in opposition, surely that is the example that does.</p>

He says that he wishes to repeal the whole of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, but does he accept that shifting public health back to local authorities gives us one of the greatest opportunities to tackle health inequalities? Will he seriously put public health back where it was before and, by so doing, continue to fail to address health inequalities?</p>

	<p pid="d.720.7/1">The hon. Lady mentions the Act, and I seem to remember that she called the Bill a hand grenade thrown into the health service. She seems to have changed her tune since then. We made huge progress on tackling smoking and improving the public health of this country, progress of which we are very proud. We can always say that we could have done more, but</p>
	<p pid="d.720.7/2">I remember putting through measures on smoking towards the end of our time in government that were opposed by those on the Government Front Bench. I am not sure how she could justify that.</p>
	<p pid="d.720.7/3">The budget cut combined with the distraction of reorganisation means that six out of 10 hospitals in England are now off target for their efficiency savings. That brings me back to where we started: this is the wrong time to reorganise the national health service. In conclusion, the House cannot reverse tonight the damage of the NHS re-organisation, but we are not powerless. There are things we can do to help the NHS at one of the most dangerous moments it has faced. Our constituents will expect us to hold Ministers to account for promises made on rationing and reconfigurations. They will want us to do the right thing by NHS staff facing pay cuts and redundancy. Our constituents have a right to expect that one of the central pledges in the coalition agreement&#8212;not to cut the NHS&#8212;will be honoured. That is the simple call of our motion this evening which, we hope, can unite all sides of the House. A vote tonight for the motion would be a positive vote for an NHS under siege and a message of appreciation for NHS staff facing uncertain times. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.721.0/1">The motion that we are debating today is typical of the Opposition. Rather than praising the NHS in a year of change, they seek to denigrate it. Rather than commending the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, they undermine their efforts and belittle their results.

Despite what he peddles around the country, waiting times remain low and stable&#8212;in fact, below where they were at the last general election. In May 2010 more than 18,000 people waited more than a year for treatment. Today that figure is just 4,317. Today 55,335 people wait more than six months for treatment&#8212;almost half the figure of 100,979 at the last general election. There are 149,912 people now waiting more than 18 weeks, compared to 209,411 in May 2010. The median wait for admitted patients has fallen in that time from 8.4 weeks to 8 weeks, and for non-admitted patients from 4.3 weeks to 4 weeks.

It gets little praise for its performance from the Opposition. I want to praise the fact that patients are reporting better outcomes for hip and knee replacements and for hernias, and the fact that the latest GP patient survey showed that 88% of patients rated their GP practice as good or very good. MORI&#8217;s independent public perceptions of the NHS survey shows satisfaction with the NHS remaining high at 70%.</p>
	<p pid="d.723.6/3">In the patient experience survey, 92% of patients who had used the NHS in the past year rated their care as good, very good or excellent. Mixed-sex accommodation breaches are down an incredible 96% since we came to power, although of course the Opposition often claimed to have eradicated that problem&#8212;not so, alas. MRSA infections are down 24% in the year, and C. difficile infections down 17%. More than a million more people have an NHS dentist. No reasonable person could look at the performance of the NHS over what has been a challenging year with anything but admiration and</p>
	<p pid="d.723.6/4">pride. I, too, would like to take this opportunity to praise NHS staff for their hard work and dedication and the excellent results they are delivering for patients.</p>

There will be &#163;12.5 billion extra for the NHS in this Parliament, &#163;12.5 billion that would never have been made available had he had his way, as he said that to do so would be irresponsible. That is exactly what his party is doing in Wales, where it is in control of the NHS. It is cutting the NHS budget in Wales by 6.5% in real terms from 2011-12 to 2014-15. His motion talks about a &#163;26 million underspend, but what he does not understand is that there has been a real-terms increase in funding for the NHS this year. Because we are no longer wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on a bloated bureaucracy and the national programme for IT, we have been able to save an extra &#163;1.1 billion in real terms from the back office and put it into front-line care.</p>

We will put in more money for front-line clinical staff, including more than 4,000 doctors&#8212;more money for doctors and treatments and for improving patient outcomes.

Not only did the right hon. Gentleman use out-of-date figures&#8212;figures for the whole year are now available&#8212;but he again misrepresented what they mean for the performance of the NHS. Across the NHS, acute NHS trusts plan to save &#163;1.3 billion during 2011-12. In the end, they saved &#163;1.2 billion. More than half&#8212;57%&#8212;of the shortfall was concentrated in just 10 NHS trusts in significant financial difficulties&#8212; 10 NHS trusts that he ignored when he was Health Secretary but that we are getting to grips with. I would point him instead to the &#163;4.3 billion of efficiency savings made in 2010-11 and the further &#163;5.8 billion of efficiency savings made in 2011-12.

	<p pid="d.726.1/4">Amazing&#8212;people actually have to be overweight to be entitled to weight-loss surgery. I would have thought that that was startlingly obvious, but obviously the right hon. Gentleman does not think so.</p>

	<p pid="d.727.4/1">No, I am making progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/2">The motion notes the growing involvement of the private sector, insisting that it represents evidence of growing privatisation. Not only is that unadulterated tosh, but I personally find it offensive to be accused of seeking to privatise the NHS, when in my political philosophy one of my core beliefs is in an NHS free at the point of use for all those eligible to use it.</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/3">Not only does the right hon. Gentleman have some difficulty understanding the meaning of &#8220;privatisation&#8221;, but he forgets his own record in government. The only plan to increase the private provision of NHS services came under the previous Government when he was Minister, when his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> was the special adviser and when Patricia Hewitt was Health Secretary. In May 2007, the right hon. Gentleman said:</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/4">&#8220;Now the private sector puts its capacity into the NHS for the benefit of NHS patients, which I think most people in this country would celebrate.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/5">Those are his words. It was his Government who saw private companies paid 11% more than NHS providers for doing the same work, and who wasted &#163;297 million on operations that never happened at independent sector treatment centres. Given that he may have forgotten, I must tell him that the Labour party manifesto in 2010, when he was the Secretary of State for Health, stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/6">&#8220;Foundation trusts will be given the freedom to expand their provision into primary and community care, and to increase their private services&#8212;where these are consistent with NHS values&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/7">That suggests that, as Secretary of State, he was prepared to have in his own party&#8217;s manifesto a policy allowing and encouraging foundation trusts to attract more work from the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.727.4/8">This Government&#8217;s Health and Social Care Act 2012 specifically prohibits the Secretary of State, Monitor or the NHS Commissioning Board from favouring any type of provider, be they from the NHS, the charitable sector or the independent sector. It does so because this Government understand something that the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s never did&#8212;it is not the nature of the provider, but the quality of the outcomes that matters most to patients.</p>

This Government are very clear that the reconfiguration of services is a matter for the local NHS, and that the best decisions are those taken closest to the front line and tailored to the needs of the local population. But, when making those decisions, it is imperative that the NHS carries the support of local people, patients, carers and clinicians.</p>

Member for Leigh will listen, given that during his speech he seemed keen to hear the Government&#8217;s response&#8212;the Government&#8217;s position is clear: it is for employers, not for the Government, to lead negotiations on the terms and conditions of their staff, and to do so with the agreement of staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.729.4/3">This Government are committed to the principles of &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221;, a national framework. The ongoing negotiations on &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221; are about ensuring that patients and taxpayers get the maximum value for money from every penny spent on the NHS, and that it is spent efficiently and effectively. The negotiations are not about a pay cut, and we would not support one.</p>
	<p pid="d.729.4/4">The Health Act 2006, brought in by the previous Government when the right hon. Gentleman was the Minister of State in the Department of Health, gives NHS trusts the power to set their own terms and conditions. Although they are free to opt out of the national pay framework, they cannot do so unilaterally; they must consult and seek agreement with their staff and representatives.</p>
	<p pid="d.729.4/5">Almost all trusts have until now chosen to stay on national terms and conditions. I believe that most still want to, but that has to be fit for purpose and fit for the future. Only one trust&#8212;Southend&#8212;has opted out of &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221;. <i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">The hon.

That trust opted out of &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221; under the last Labour Government. Perhaps he would like to apologise.</p>
	<p pid="d.729.4/6">Pay is the largest element of NHS costs, and pay systems must evolve. The trusts in the south-west wish to work and negotiate with the trade unions to agree changes, not to dismiss and re-engage staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.730.4/1">Thank you for calling me early, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am delighted to be able to participate in this important debate just before the recess.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/2">I refer hon. Members to part of the Opposition motion:</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/3">&#8220;That this House regrets the growing gap between Ministers&#8217; statements and what is happening in the NHS; notes mounting evidence of rationing of treatments and services by cost, despite Ministers&#8217; claims to have prevented it&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/4">I would like to highlight one specific example. The Minister, who is not paying attention at the moment, may wish to make note of the issue, because it matters to cancer patients in my area and across the country. I am talking about the lack of access to advanced radiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/5">By way of background, I should say that the national cancer action team told NHS commissioners that radiotherapy is involved in 40% of cases in which cancer is cured. Furthermore, radiotherapy by itself now cures 16% of cancer patients. By contrast, cancer drugs are the main cure of only 2% of cancer patients. We can draw the conclusion that I hope the Department of Health and Ministers would accept: radiotherapy cures far more cancer patients than drugs. They should issue instructions to commissioners to reflect that and make money available for radiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/6">The current allocations are inadequate and arguably paltry. The radiotherapy budget for the current year is just &#163;350 million, while the cancer drug budget is close to &#163;1.5 billion. Within that sits the Government&#8217;s flagship cancer drugs fund, which, according to information that I have received, was underspent by &#163;150 million. Despite that underspend, an additional &#163;200 million is going into the cancer drugs fund. My concern is that that money is not for cancer patients but for cancer drug companies.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/7">The whole idea is becoming discredited&#8212;so much so that, as has been reported in the newspapers, even Mr Clive Stone, the Prime Minister&#8217;s constituent who originally inspired the fund, has asked for less money to be put into the fund. Why? He now needs advanced radiotherapy for his cancer and there is no money available for him.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/8">The cancer drugs fund cannot be used to fund advanced radiotherapy, and that is a real concern. I have no doubt that during the winding-up speeches we will be told that the Government are putting in an extra &#163;150 million into new radiotherapy treatments over the next four years. The Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)</phrase>, keeps telling us that, but when I ask him where the first and second year allocations&#8212;&#163;13 million and &#163;22 million&#8212;are being spent, he tells us that he does not know.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/9">I thought I would try to help out the Minister, so I sent freedom of information requests to every strategic health authority asking how much of the money they had received and how their PCTs had spent it. I have good news for the Minister, who is not in his place. It is that he is not the only one who is in the dark when it comes to that &#163;13 million and &#163;22 million; the SHAs do not know either. I have the replies with me. I was going to read them out, but unfortunately I do not have time.</p>
	<p pid="d.730.4/10">The stark truth is that under this Government no new money is going into providing the latest radiotherapy technologies for the NHS. In March last year, the Secretary of State commended some of the new facilities, including the new CyberKnife system at St Bartholomew&#8217;s hospital in London. Members, some of whom have also been to see the system, are concerned that charities are having to be used to raise money to buy that vital equipment. When I raised that issue in this Chamber, the Minister disputed that, but I have furnished him with a list of areas where it is happening. The Minister should accept his responsibility, get a grip on the situation and ensure that cancer patients needing advanced radiotherapy have access to the service that they need. I support the motion.</p>

Morris)</phrase>, who is a member of the Health Committee. I hope he will forgive me if I do not follow him down the specialist course of radiotherapy services.</p>
	<p pid="d.731.0/2">I want to address my remarks primarily to the shadow Health Secretary and to begin with an echo from a different era. When I first came to the House, there used to be something called &#8220;Whitelaw&#8217;s law&#8221;, which, obviously, referred to the late Willie Whitelaw. &#8220;The more he blusters,&#8221; we used to say, &#8220;the less he believes it.&#8221; The shadow Health Secretary gave us an Olympic-class demonstration of the principle of Whitelaw&#8217;s law. He blustered from the Dispatch Box and got himself into several dead ends. It became clear that he did not really believe that he had answers for the challenges facing the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.731.0/3">I refer the right hon. Gentleman to a point that he made and which I agree with. The most important statement about the current state of the health service was not made by him as Secretary of State&#8212;and, with great respect to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, it was not made by him either. It was made by</p>
	<p pid="d.731.0/4">Sir David Nicholson in his annual report to the national health service in May 2009, and it was endorsed by the right hon. Gentleman. Sir David said, looking forward to the period of this Parliament:</p>
	<p pid="d.731.0/5">&#8220;we must be prepared for a range of scenarios, including the possibility that investment will be frozen for a time. We should also plan on the assumption that we will need to release unprecedented levels of efficiency savings between 2011 and 2014&#8212;between &#163;15 billion and &#163;20 billion across the service over the three years.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.731.0/6">I agreed with what the shadow Secretary of State said about the importance of what we, in the Health Committee, dubbed &#8220;the Nicholson challenge&#8221;. I believe that that is the central challenge facing the national health service. The sadness in this debate was that the right hon. Gentleman gave us no hint as to how he believes the health service should address that central challenge about which he and I agree.</p>

	<p pid="d.732.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, but let us not go down that route. At the time when Sir David Nicholson was writing, the Labour Government were contemplating the possibility not of a real-terms freeze, which is in effect what is planned under the coalition, but of a cash freeze, which would have been substantially more difficult to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="d.732.1/2">The main issue now is how we deliver services that meet the demands placed on the system against the background of a resource allocation to the health service that was always going to be dramatically less generous than it was during the earlier years of the Labour Government.

	<p pid="d.732.3/2">The challenge for the Opposition is to show that they are willing to map a future for the health service, in much more constrained financial circumstances, that allows it to meet the demand for services that is going to be placed on it and to fulfil the aspirations that we all have for improved quality of service. That becomes increasingly difficult in the light of motions such as the one that the right hon. Gentleman has put down for the House to consider. He invites us to regret</p>

	<p pid="d.732.3/7">how the health service needed to meet the challenges that it faced, and that the private sector had an important role&#8212;of course, not an exclusive role&#8212;in introducing the solutions to the challenge that Sir David Nicholson articulated in May 2009. The same approach was taken in the Labour party&#8217;s manifesto for the 2010 general election.</p>
	<p pid="d.732.3/8">The challenge that the right hon.

	<p pid="d.733.2/1">This debate comes less than a week after the Secretary of State&#8217;s announcement that he is putting South London Healthcare NHS trust into administration. He will therefore not be surprised, and nor will the House, that I intend to focus on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/2">Not surprisingly, this announcement has caused massive alarm and concern across south-east London. Staff working for the NHS in all three affected boroughs&#8212;Greenwich, Bromley and Bexley&#8212;are all worried about whether they will continue to have a job. Patients and their relatives are worried that the NHS services on which they have depended for years may no longer be available, as rumours abound about potential cuts and closures affecting hospital services. What is most regrettable is that all this is utterly unnecessary. Indeed, there is a strong suspicion that the whole process of putting South London Healthcare into administration is driven by politics&#8212;by the Government&#8217;s wish to send a message about being tough with trusts in deficit rather than by a rational assessment of what is most likely to help the trust to improve its clinical and financial performance.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/3">Let us look at the facts. At the time when the Secretary of State made his announcement, briefings appeared in the media about South London Healthcare being a failing trust with poor standards of clinical care. On the contrary, the trust has shown significant improvement in clinical performance. It is one of the top five trusts in the UK in terms of low mortality, hospital infection rates are three times lower than the national average, and the four-hour target for A and E patients has been met month on month since February. For those of us who have been working with South London Healthcare to raise its performance, it is particularly galling to see the Secretary of State dismissing those achievements and incorrectly claiming, as he did on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-28">28 June</phrase> in a communication to MPs, that patients at the trust</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/4">&#8220;experience some of the longest waits for treatment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/5">That is simply not true of South London Healthcare today. It may have been true a year ago, but, as I said, there has been improvement, and the Secretary of State has ignored that. Indeed, he himself appears to realise that his criticisms were wide of the mark, as just one week after he made that statement I received a letter from him, as did many other London MPs, starting with the following memorable words:</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/6">&#8220;Dear Colleague,</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/7">I wanted to write to you with a summary of the excellent performance of the NHS in your area&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/8">You couldn&#8217;t make it up; talk about the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/9">What about the deficit? Yes, there is a deficit&#8212;about &#163;70 million last year&#8212;but South London Healthcare has been implementing a series of service changes designed to reduce it over the next four years while at the same time improving the standards of health care. Ironically, its task has been made much more difficult by the Secretary of State, who knows only too well that two years ago, in summer 2010, he intervened to halt the implementation of a clinically led plan to reconfigure services in south-east London entitled &#8220;A picture of health&#8221;, which, after six months&#8217; delay and a review that he imposed, was judged to meet all four of the necessary tests. His intervention merely delayed a reconfiguration process that was going to improve services and save money. Now, after a wholly unnecessary and costly delay, the plan is proceeding, with the consolidation of A and E services on two, rather than three, sites and similar moves to concentrate specialisms: stroke at Bromley; elective surgery at Queen Mary&#8217;s, Sidcup; and maternity at Queen Elizabeth, Woolwich. All those changes have helped to improve performance and have made savings. Ironically, the same Secretary of State who delayed the implementation of these improvements is now blaming the trust for the deficit without acknowledging his own part in the process.</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/10">South London Healthcare has been in existence for just three years. It came into being as a merger of three trusts, all of which faced deficits and needed support and help to get out of their problems. As the trust&#8217;s ex-acting chair, who was removed from office today, said in his letter to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-09">9 July</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/11">&#8220;We have been prepared to take strong action&#8212;we are the only Trust in London to successfully close an A and E department and move maternity services&#8230;What we have not been prepared to do is to promise more than is within our capacity to deliver; nor to mask structural issues that need to be addressed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.733.2/12">It is a tragedy that, rather than supporting the trust in its really good work in improving patient care and reducing the deficit, the Secretary of State has acted in an arbitrary and unfair way and is trying to blame the trust for a problem for which he has a large measure of responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="d.735.0/1">I want to highlight some of the issues that people in Worcestershire are facing. Like many parts of the country, we are facing a joint services review of our acute trust.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.0/2">For those who do not know Worcestershire, it has three hospitals, including a private finance initiative hospital, which is costing 5% of the total health spend in the county. The PFI deal was made under the Labour Government, who have admitted that there is a case for saying that they were poor at negotiating PFI contracts from the outset. In Worcestershire, not only were they poor at negotiating the contract; they also put the hospital in the wrong place. Our PFI hospital is in the south of the county, which is all very well for people who live there, but for the 200,000-plus people who live in the north of the county, it is extremely difficult to get to. For somebody who lives in Redditch, it is far easier to get to a hospital in Birmingham than to one in Worcester.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.0/3">We are now undertaking yet another review. Once again, people in Redditch see that their hospital and their services, including A and E, maternity and children&#8217;s services, are under threat. I say once again because six years ago we were in the same position. I know that spending in our health economy has been increasing, but we in Worcestershire are paying for the overspends of the past few years and need to save money.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.0/4">I put it on the record that the people of Redditch want to retain their A and E. As their Member of Parliament, I totally agree with them. We are in the early stages of the consultation, but I urge Ministers to look closely at this matter. The Secretary of State has visited the Alexandra hospital and seen for himself what a good hospital it is. Importantly, it was paid for and is owned by the NHS. I will be asking for a cross-party meeting in due course, which I hope my right hon. Friend will agree to, because the people of Redditch are once again working together. Apart from the Labour parliamentary candidate, people have put party politics aside to work together to save our A and E.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.0/5">I know that many other Members want to speak in this debate. I just wanted to put the marker down that we in Redditch want our A and E and that I intend to fight for it.</p>

	<p pid="d.735.1/1">We all know that the massive top-down reorganisation of the national health service that the Government have pushed through had not a jot of public support, that no one voted for it and that it was not mentioned in the famous coalition agreement. Nevertheless, it was proceeded with.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.1/2">We are now faced with something that was not in the election manifesto of either of the Government parties. Nor, I suspect, was it in any of the election literature of</p>
	<p pid="d.735.1/3">any of the MPs from those parties in the south-west. I do not think that any of them said, to use the phrase of the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, &#8220;We admire you people in the health service so much that we have decided that you will have to pay more for your pension and work longer, and that your pension will be smaller.&#8221; I do not think that any of the Lib Dem or Tory candidates in the south-west put in their leaflets, &#8220;We admire you people in the national health service so much that we intend to reduce your pay.&#8221; None of them said, &#8220;We admire you so much that we are going to reduce your entitlement to leave.&#8221; None of them has said, at a time when there is rightly increasing concern about the standard of care in hospitals at the weekend, &#8220;We intend to reduce or get rid of your overtime pay at weekends.&#8221; I would not wish to be admired by a Health Minister, because something nasty would clearly appear shortly afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.1/4">People in the national health service are sick to death of this massive reorganisation, of thousands of their colleagues being made redundant, of people having to reapply for their own jobs, and of being expected to do their day job while falling into line with the preposterous ideas in the major health legislation that went through this House. On top of that, they are now being told that they cannot be paid what they used to be paid. Apparently, people in the south-west say, &#8220;Pay down here tends to be lower, so let&#8217;s reduce the higher pay of people in the public sector, such as those in the hospitals, to the miserable levels that the private sector pays people here.&#8221; It is not likely that giving people even lower pay, which is always associated with poor health, will improve the public health of people in the south-west, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase>, who is herself a GP in the south-west, has talked about.</p>
	<p pid="d.735.1/5">What the Government have done is disgraceful and is in clear breach of their manifesto commitments. They are now attacking people in the national health service. I laud and admire people who work in the national health service. There may be some bad &#8217;uns&#8212;there are bad &#8217;uns everywhere&#8212;but most of them work very hard and brilliantly on our behalf, none more so than those at University College hospital in my constituency and at the Kentish Town health centre, which I was happy be at recently with Alan Bennett for the ceremony to celebrate 125 years of the Wigg practice, which serves people brilliantly. Believe me: when I talk to people at those two institutions, the main people who are denigrated are the Tory Ministers who have wished all this upon them. I join in that denigration.</p>

	<p pid="d.736.0/1">I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate. The NHS is clearly important to all of us. I have seen it personally because I have had a number of operations and through my working life in the hospice movement, where I saw how the care that is provided is so important to the families we were looking after. Clearly, the dedication of the staff is great and I pay tribute to them.</p>
	<p pid="d.736.0/2">Listening to the Opposition today, it is hard to take them seriously. We can see what they would do with the NHS if they were in power by their actions in Wales. They have cut the budget, resulting in an increase of 51% in the number of patients waiting to start treatment</p>
	<p pid="d.736.0/3">and an increase of 156% in the number of those waiting for more than 26 weeks. All the bad news from the Opposition is therefore difficult to swallow.</p>
	<p pid="d.736.0/4">I will give a couple of examples from my area. I recently met some GPs and clinicians to talk about the work they are doing to redesign musculoskeletal services. They have brought in innovative ways of ensuring that the patient knows exactly what will happen to them. Clinicians across primary care, community services and secondary care are working together to ensure that the patient has a clear understanding of the care that they will receive. They use map displays, which show a clear pathway, offer educational content for GPs to ensure that patients get the highest standard of care, and ensure that information is available for the patient.</p>
	<p pid="d.736.0/5">I am proud to say that on Friday, one of the surgeries in my constituency will open a new well-being centre, which will provide a place where health care, social care and the third sector can come together to provide better ways to improve health and well-being in the town.</p>

	<p pid="d.737.1/1">The hon. Gentleman pre-empts the next part of my speech and I am grateful to him for that.</p>
	<p pid="d.737.1/2">As this is a health debate, I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would expect me to talk about the safe and sustainable review of children&#8217;s heart units. Like other Members, I have received a number of e-mails from various organisations today. One of them said that some MPs should seek to reignite the debate and that I should think about the children because if I had children, I would move heaven and earth to ensure that the service was the very best. Frankly, throughout the campaign on children&#8217;s heart units, I have only ever thought about the children. Of course I want the very best service for them, as do the right hon. and hon. Members from all parts of the House who have worked on the campaign. I have always accepted that there is a need for change. That is why I want to discuss a few related points this evening. I know that I will have an opportunity to raise it in greater detail tomorrow, but it is important that I speak about it tonight.</p>
	<p pid="d.737.1/3">Access and travel times are incredibly important to the families who use children&#8217;s heart services. Logical health planning surely dictates that services should be based according to where the population lies. The British Congenital Cardiac Association states:</p>
	<p pid="d.737.1/4">&#8220;Where possible, the location of units providing paediatric cardiac surgery should reflect the distribution of the population to minimise disruption and strain on families.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.737.2/1">That is exactly the point that Members who represent Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire are concerned about. The proposals will mean that patients will have to travel, and expecting families in northern Lincolnshire to get to Newcastle is simply not acceptable.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.738.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40489" speakername="Stuart Andrew" colnum="738"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071631000904">
	<p pid="d.738.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend, who brings me on to my next point. Independent analysis of patient flows showed that the majority of people in the Doncaster, Leeds, Sheffield and Wakefield area would not go to Newcastle; they would probably choose centres in Liverpool, Birmingham or even London. The NHS constitution states that patients have the right to make choices about their NHS care, yet the joint committee of primary care trusts has asserted that Newcastle could reach the minimum number of procedures if parents were &#8220;properly managed&#8221;. That flies in the face of patient choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.0/2">Furthermore, the review has ignored the views of the people. I do not think there has ever been a petition as large as the one from Yorkshire, with more than 600,000 people&#8217;s signatures, but it counted as only one representation in the meeting at which the decision was made. I will raise a number of issues tomorrow to do with the scoring process that was used in the review, but I believe that the change will provide a poorer quality of service for Yorkshire and Humber families. Clinical experts from the BCCA, the Bristol inquiry, the Paediatric Intensive Care Society and the Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthetists say that paediatric services should all be under one roof. In Leeds, we have a dedicated children&#8217;s hospital with all the services under one roof, so it is ready-made.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.0/3">I urge Ministers to look into the process of the review and see whether they believe it was properly run. Given the closeness of the scores for Leeds and Newcastle, and considering the outcry that has come from Yorkshire and the Humber, I hope that they will give both centres an opportunity, until April 2014, to demonstrate that they can comply with all the standards that the clinicians on the safe and sustainable steering group have recommended. If one or both centres fail to meet any of those standards, the decision should be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.0/4">This is a very important issue for my constituents. The number of letters that I and my colleagues from around Yorkshire and the Humber are receiving shows how strongly people feel about it, and I urge Ministers to listen to our concerns.</p>

	<p pid="d.738.1/1">Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate, Mr Speaker. I wish to bring to the House&#8217;s attention some of the realities on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/2">NHS North West London is currently conducting a flawed consultation, which is cynically being held during the Olympics and the summer months, on proposals for the reconfiguration of acute hospital services. The proposals would mean the closure of four out of nine accident and emergency departments, including Ealing&#8217;s, and the effective closure of Ealing hospital, my local hospital. My right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State recently described those shocking proposals, accurately, as &#8220;butchery&#8221;, not reconfiguration.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/3">The proposals are put forward as clinically led, but that is far from the truth. At a recent meeting convened to discuss them, consultants at Ealing hospital and GPs from right across the London borough of Ealing voted unanimously against the proposal to close Ealing hospital. Other clinicians from right across north-west London are also opposed to the changes, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40219" name="Angie Bray">the hon. Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray)</phrase>, who has just left the Chamber, has rightly said that they are</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/4">financially driven. I take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the staff at Ealing hospital, who are working hard to provide services to patients during this time of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/5">The Nicholson challenge means that across the country, &#163;20 billion of savings must be found in the NHS by 2014, and &#163;1 billion of those is earmarked to come from north-west London. It is clear that this is a top-down restructuring of hospital services, driven totally by financial considerations. The proposals are being railroaded through by the remnants of the old PCTs before they are abolished next April and replaced with clinical commissioning groups. That is a top-down reorganisation of local hospitals by an unaccountable body that, after making these major decisions, will no longer exist. That flies in the face of what the Prime Minister said to me at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions&#8212;that such a decision should have the support of local doctors and patients. Local GPs and patients are overwhelmingly against the proposals, so they should be withdrawn immediately. The Prime Minister has also repeatedly told me that there are no plans to close Ealing hospital. Given that after his visit to Ealing he said that he liked what he saw, I expect him to join me, local doctors, patients and all political parties in opposing the plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/6">The Secretary of State, too, is on record as saying that there were no plans to close Ealing hospital&#8217;s A and E, and as asking where all the people who use it would go. Approximately 100,000 people a year attend there, of whom 55,000 use the urgent care centre and 45,000 are treated in the full A and E department. Where will all those people go for treatment if Ealing&#8217;s A and E is closed? Other A and E departments that are not proposed for closure are already under pressure from their own population and would not be able to cope with the extra numbers. Services would suffer, and waiting times would become intolerable.</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/7">The preferred option being consulted on also includes the closure of the Central Middlesex, Hammersmith and Charing Cross A and Es. That would be reckless and dangerous, and would leave a large swathe of west London without adequate A and E cover. Three London boroughs&#8212;Ealing, Brent and Hammersmith&#8212;would be left without any A and E. What would happen if there were a major incident similar to the Southall rail crash in Ealing or elsewhere in west London, or, God forbid, an air crash or terrorist incident?</p>
	<p pid="d.738.1/8">The plan is opposed by clinicians, patients, politicians of all parties and members of the public, and it should be scrapped immediately. I will support the motion this evening.</p>

	<p pid="d.739.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40221" name="Virendra Sharma">the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma)</phrase>, a fellow member of the Health Committee. He makes a strong case on behalf of his constituents, and one hopes that any reconfiguration will be evidence-based and, above all, based on clinical governance and clinical safety.</p>
	<p pid="d.739.0/2">This is an important debate&#8212;indeed, we cannot debate the future of the NHS enough, because it concerns many Members and their constituents. It draws passion and a great deal of interest, because it affects everyone&#8217;s lives. I therefore congratulate the Opposition on giving us the opportunity to debate it this evening.</p>
	<p pid="d.739.0/3">I apologise to the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, for not having heard his speech. I had to attend an urgent meeting with a Minister to discuss the closure of a Remploy factory in my constituency. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> gave me a pr&#233;cis of the Minister&#8217;s wise remarks as best he could&#8212;without, of course, being able to convey fully his panache and oratorical dexterity. I understand that the Minister made a number of important remarks about one issue that I want to discuss, as a Member representing west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, which, apart from being the centre of the world, are in the far south-west. That issue is pay and conditions for staff. As I understand it, he emphasised the point that no such independent review of pay, conditions and the salaries of staff in such an area can proceed without the full involvement and support of the unions, and their engagement in the final decisions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.740.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" speakername="Alison Seabeck" colnum="740"  time="018:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071631000907">
	<p pid="d.740.0/1">It is absolutely right that the trade unions should be involved, because this is an enormous issue, particularly for staff morale in the south-west. Does the hon. Gentleman not share my concern that thus far the consortium has shown no great desire to undertake that consultation in the south-west? That really has to change.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.740.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="740"  time="018:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071631000908">
	<p pid="d.740.1/1">The hon. Lady makes an important point. Lezli Boswell, the chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, wrote to me on behalf of the consortium about concerns that have been raised, including by the unions, saying that once the national pay review has concluded under &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221; it would then be appropriate, if it is at all appropriate, for any further local discussions to proceed. Without union involvement in the work of the consortium, I agree with the hon. Lady that the proposal is irrelevant and potentially disruptive and dangerous, given its impact on staff morale throughout the NHS in the south-west. My hon. Friends will be listening closely to this debate, and to the concerns that have been raised by many Members and, indeed, by staff across the south-west about the consequences for staff morale and the impact on NHS services. I certainly hope that the Secretary of State will address those issues when he concludes the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/2">A key issue is one that dare not speak its name&#8212;it affected staff morale under the previous Government as well&#8212;but it is the increasing pressure on front-line NHS staff. The staffing levels at the coal face have never been sufficient to provide a safe staff to patient ratio. Many people have been critical of nursing and care standards in the NHS, but they often overlook staffing ratios.</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/3">I have also expressed concerns about the out-of-hours service in Cornwall&#8212;I know that we will not have time to discuss that&#8212;and the Care Quality Commission will produce a report as a result of those concerns, which were also voiced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/4">On pay for staff in the south-west, the chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust said to me in a letter:</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/5">&#8220;In recent years NHS organisations have largely exhausted other avenues of potential cost-saving (including reducing reliance on bank or agency staff and implementing service improvement</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/6">initiatives). Monitor&#8230;has also estimated that NHS organisations with a turnover of around &#163;200m will need to produce savings of around &#163;9m a year for each year until 2016/17 to remain in financial health.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/7">She goes on to say that the consortium, which consists of 20 organisations in the south-west,</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/8">&#8220;is looking at how pay costs may be reduced, whilst maintaining a transparent and fair system that is better able to reward high performance, incentivise the workforce and support the continued delivery of high quality healthcare.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.740.1/9">Does the Secretary of State agree with that, and how does he intend that that should proceed? How will he protect staff and staff morale, because the consequences will, I fear, derail national negotiations on &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221; and drive down pay and morale, particularly in an area of very low wages? I hope that he is listening.</p>

	<p pid="d.741.3/1">Thank you, Sir. I shall try to respect your advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/2">In November 2011, the following announcement appeared on the Central Middlesex hospital website:</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/3">&#8220;A and E at Central Middx Hospital is temporarily closing overnight between 7 pm and 8 am starting from <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-14">Monday 14 November 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/4">The urgent care centre next to A and E will remain open 24 hrs a day 7 days a week to treat patients with minor injuries and illness.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/5">We are making this temporary change to ensure we continue to provide a safe service to patients during the winter months.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/6">In those three paragraphs, we hear twice over that that overnight closure is temporary, which gave minimal comfort to my constituents in Brent who used the facility. The overnight closure is indeed temporary. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-02">2 July</phrase>, a consultation entitled &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221; was launched in north-west London, and residents can submit their views until <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-08">8 October</phrase> this year. The consultation, promoted by a transitional body called NHS North West London, aims to centralise and rationalise hospital services in the area. Each proposal outlined in the consultation includes the closure of the A and E at Central Middlesex&#8212;not overnight provision, but the 24-hour facility&#8212;for good.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/7">The motion speaks of</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/8">&#8220;the growing gap between Ministers&#8217; statements and what is happening in the NHS&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/9">I may have trouble agreeing with that, because it depends on which Minister and which statements. The Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40113" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)</phrase>, received an e-mail from me today advising her that, if called to speak, I would quote her in this evening&#8217;s debate. I wanted to do so, because she made the following three statements. First:</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/10">&#8220;The Tories would be a disaster for the NHS, they plan a part privatised service&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/11">The second quotation:</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/12">&#8220;These cuts will hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/13">The third quotation:</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/14">&#8220;The government must take urgent steps to safeguard our local NHS&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/15">Those three quotes date respectively from 2003, 2007 and 2007, when the hon. Lady was campaigning to keep open the accident and emergency centre at Central Middlesex hospital&#8212;campaigning for something which she, in her government, is now closing. No wonder her latest comment is:</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/16">&#8220;This flawed consultation, which does not allow residents to say that they want to save the A and E, is a kick in the teeth for all local people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.741.3/17">I do not speak Parseltongue&#8212;I do not understand it&#8212;but I deplore the pretence of opposing a policy that you are pushing through in government. That is really disgraceful.</p>

	<p pid="d.742.0/1">Mr Cunningham, you have until 7.10 pm before the Minister responds.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.742.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40579" speakername="Alex Cunningham" colnum="742"  time="019:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071631000914">
	<p pid="d.742.1/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="d.742.1/2">Patients in my constituency of Stockton North are already feeling the pain from the Tories&#8217; policies. The number of admitted patients who have waited longer than 18 weeks for an operation rose by a staggering 49% between May 2010 and November 2011, and I have no doubt that the figure is much higher now.</p>
	<p pid="d.742.1/3">The North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust faces a drastic cut to its budget of &#163;40 million over three years. Chief executive Alan Foster has said that that is the most difficult financial position the he has ever faced and has acknowledged that the cuts will undoubtedly lead to unpopular decisions to keep the trust afloat. The trust is trying very hard, and it has even resorted to car boot sales to try to balance the books. Some of those cuts could be achieved if the Government got behind the trust and did something to ensure that the two North Tees and Hartlepool university hospitals are replaced by one midway between the two communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.742.1/4">My fear is that there will be no new hospital and the trust will be forced to close one of the existing hospitals if it is to have any chance at all of delivering &#163;40 million cuts in the next few years. We could end up without any of the benefits of a new hospital, and the targets might still not be achievable. Such a cut would almost certainly cause irreparable damage to the trust&#8217;s ability to maintain the excellent range of high- quality services of which it is justly proud. It will undermine all the good work that has gone on in the trust over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.742.1/5">I know that the trust will keep patient safety, quality and performance at the top of its agenda as it goes through this difficult period, but it will not be easy to deliver services to the 350,000 people who depend on them, as they have in the past. The north-east already experiences far greater levels of poor health than the national average. It must be due to the heavy industries and resultant poor environment, as our region mined coal, built ships and made chemicals and steel. The budget cuts will only worsen this position.</p>
	<p pid="d.742.1/6">The last Labour Government worked hard to reduce the kind of health inequality faced in my constituency, where men can expect to live 14.8 years less in one part of the constituency than in another. Real progress was made to close the gap, but even so, it has proved painstakingly slow, as much work requires huge resources, which are now being denied. I feel the gap growing, even though I know that Stockton borough council has recently appointed a high-calibre person to head up public health. We will not be able to make the progress everyone wants if he and the NHS are starved of resources.</p>

	<p pid="d.743.0/1">We have had a good debate, albeit one slightly curtailed by statements. We have heard 10 speeches from Back-Bench Members and I would especially like to commend my right hon. Friends the Members for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford) and for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson) and my hon. Friends the Members for Easington (Grahame M. Morris), for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma), for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) and for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham) for their contributions. I also rightly want to pay tribute to the many thousands who work in our national health service, doing a tremendous job in often challenging and difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.743.0/2">As we have heard in the debate today, there are growing problems in the national health service. We know that two thirds of NHS acute trusts&#8212;65%&#8212;are reported to have fallen behind on their efficiency targets. As we have heard from right hon. and hon. Members, we are starting to see temporary ward and accident and emergency closures, while a quarter of walk-in centres are closing across England. Despite the &#8220;Through the Looking Glass&#8221; world of Ministers&#8212;one where the Secretary of State for Health closes a debate&#8212;we now have growing rationing across the national health service, with treatments&#8212;including cataracts, hip and knee replacements&#8212;being restricted or stopped altogether by one primary care trust or another.</p>

	<p pid="d.743.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not acknowledge that the real weakness of this debate, as specified by the Select Committee Chairman, is that the Labour party has at no point spelled out how it would meet the &#163;20 billion Nicholson challenge? Will he tell us?</p>

	<p pid="d.743.2/1">We set out the Nicholson challenge, but I notice that the hon. Gentleman does not defend the decisions being taken by his Government to restrict or stop these treatments.</p>
	<p pid="d.743.2/2">It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a gap between Ministers&#8217; statements on the NHS and people&#8217;s real experience of it on the ground. In opening, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase> incorrectly said that GP referrals have gone down. Figures published by the Department of Health on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-13">13 July 2012</phrase> show that GP referrals are up by 1.9% year on year. Those are statistics from the Minister&#8217;s own Department&#8217;s. He is out of touch. Furthermore, the Minister said that NHS Hull is not restricting procedures on ganglia, but a freedom of information request we received says:</p>
	<p pid="d.743.2/3">&#8220;NHS Hull will not routinely commission excision of ganglia&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.743.2/4">That was in April 2012, and it is a fact, again showing that Ministers are out of touch. The Secretary of State claimed that there is no such evidence of treatments being restricted or decommissioned.</p>

	<p pid="d.744.1/1">I will not, as I do not have time now.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/2">In the Secretary of State&#8217;s annual report to Parliament, he dismissed restrictions on bariatric surgery as &#8220;meaningless&#8221; and continued to say:</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/3">&#8220;Time and again, he says&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/4">that is my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/5">&#8216;&#8220;Oh, they are rationing.&#8217; They are not&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-04.923"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 July 2012; Vol. 547, c. 923</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/6">But Opposition Members all know the truth. Aside from the evidence presented by the Labour party and the &#8220;GP Magazine&#8221;, verified by Full Fact, primary care trusts acknowledge that they are restricting access to bariatric surgery. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends surgery for anyone with a body mass index of 40 or a BMI of 35 and co-morbidity. Many PCTs, including NHS Stockport in my own constituency of Denton and Reddish, impose additional restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/7">Recent freedom of information requests of PCTs and shadow clinical commissioning groups across England have revealed that 149 separate treatments, previously provided for free by the NHS, have been either restricted or stopped altogether in the last two years, with 41 of those being entirely stopped in some parts of the country. This provides the clearest evidence yet of random rationing across the NHS and of an accelerating postcode lottery, which appears to be part of a co-ordinated drive to shrink the level of NHS free provision. From our study, it is clear that many patients are facing difficulties in accessing routine treatments that were previously readily available, and there is evidence that some patients are being forced to consider private services in areas where the NHS has entirely stopped providing the treatment.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/8">Of course, there has been a real reduction in the number of nurses working in the NHS. The Government have claimed that there are only 450 fewer nurses, and at Health questions last month, the Minister, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford said that the figure was &#8220;nowhere near 4,000&#8221;. But now we all know the truth: figures for the NHS work force in March 2012 showed clearly that there are 3,904 fewer nurses than in May 2010. We have seen broken promise after broken promise, including on reconfigurations.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/9">It was this Government who, when in opposition, spent millions of pounds during the general election putting up posters throughout the country reassuring the electorate that under the Conservatives there would be a moratorium on hospital and A and E closures. Indeed, in opposition, they pledged to overturn some very difficult reconfiguration decisions taken by the previous Labour Government. Yet, as we have seen, the moratorium has not materialised, and there is now evidence of major changes to hospital services across the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/10">It is worth remembering that the Prime Minister gave a firm pledge not to close services at Chase Farm hospital, but in September 2011, this Secretary of</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/11">State accepted the recommendations and approved the downgrading and closure of services at Chase Farm. And there are several others, such as the Hartlepool, the King George hospital in Ilford, the East London, the Trafford General, the North London, the St Cross in Rugby and, as we have heard today, the West London, too, that have either closed or are set to close. What is becoming clear is that when it comes to reconfiguration, Ministers are hiding behind their new localism and are happy to blame the soon-to-be-abolished structures for the forthcoming closures.</p>
	<p pid="d.744.1/12">In the brief time remaining, I want to deal with Government spending on the health service. As we have learned, actual Government spending on the NHS in 2011-12 fell by &#163;26 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.745.1/1">No, I will not.</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/2">This was the second successive real-terms reduction in NHS spending, following a reduction of &#163;766 million in the Government&#8217;s first year in office. This is in clear breach of the commitment given by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in their coalition agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/3">Of course, a long line of professionals have come, one after the other, to express their concern about the damage that will be done to the health service if hospital is pitted against hospital, and doctor against doctor. That is where we start. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 now allows hospitals completely to change character over time. The Government have essentially set everybody on their own. Hospitals are being told, &#8220;You&#8217;re on your own. There&#8217;s no support from the centre any more; no more bail-outs.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/4">We know that there are problems with the NHS meeting efficiency targets. Indeed, a survey of NHS chief executives and chairmen found that one in four believe that the current financial pressures are the</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/5">&#8220;worst they have ever experienced&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/6">with a further 46% saying they were &#8220;very serious&#8221;. More than half of foundation trusts missed their savings plan targets, according to Monitor&#8217;s review of the last financial year.</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/7">Ministers have said that every penny saved will be a penny reinvested to the benefit of patient care, but in reality &#163;1.4 billion of the &#163;1.7 billion not spent by the Department of Health has been returned to the Treasury&#8212;more broken promises. It is therefore clear for all to see that there is an increasing gap between what the Government are saying and what is going on in the NHS, and the experience of ordinary patients on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/8">The Government have increasingly broken their promises on the NHS. They promised no top-down reorganisation and a moratorium on hospital closures and they promised to maintain spending levels in the NHS. They have broken all those promises&#8212;they are the three biggest broken promises in the history of the NHS. There is clearly a yawning gap between what the Prime Minister and others say and the reality of patients&#8217; experience.</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/9">During the general election, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/10">&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut the deficit, not the NHS.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.745.1/11">It is now clear that the Government are cutting our NHS. The NHS is important for the people of our country, and they deserve better. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.746.0/1">I was rather disappointed by the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>. Like the motion, the hon. Gentleman failed to say anything about NHS staff, or to reflect the admiration and respect we have for them. The motion and his speech were just another occasion for Labour to use the NHS as a political football, fuelled by nothing but distortions, inaccuracies and myths.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.0/2">I always welcome such debates, because they give hon. Members an opportunity to raise constituency issues. Many did&#8212;I will respond to the points they made&#8212;but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State, did not. When the Conservative Opposition raised debates on the NHS before the election, as we often did, we had an alternative policy to express and arguments to put forward. Like the motion, his speech was empty of argument and of fact, and he and the Labour party are empty of policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman told us only that he wants to abolish the Health and Social Care Act 2012. If that happened, there would be no clinical commissioning in the NHS. In fact, nobody would be responsible for commissioning. He would abolish local authorities&#8217; responsibilities for public health in their area, which they are embracing and acting on. He would abolish health and wellbeing boards, which are integrating health and social care more effectively. He would abolish the duties in the legislation for NHS bodies to act to reduce health inequalities, which rose under a Labour Government.</p>

He talked about more support for radiotherapy. He must recognise that we committed to &#163;150 million additional support for radiotherapy in the cancer outcomes strategy. That will be available. He mentioned CyberKnife, which is a brand name for stereotactic beam therapy. That form of therapy is available in the NHS and will continue to be available. He neglected to mention that I announced during the past few months new plans for the establishment of two major centres for proton beam therapy in this country, which will mean that patients no longer have to go abroad to access it.</p>

	<p pid="d.746.4/1">No.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40158" name="Stephen Dorrell">the Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell)</phrase> made an important point on the Nicholson challenge, which a number of Opposition Members mentioned. At least one or two of them had the good</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/3">grace to recognise that David Nicholson&#8217;s proposals were set out in May 2009, under, and endorsed by, a Labour Government. Labour Members now want nothing to do with the consequences of meeting that financial challenge. They fail to recognise, as my right hon. Friend said, that the challenge was against the background of an expectation that a Labour Government would not increase the NHS budget, and that the challenge would have to be achieved within three years. The Conservative Government have increased the budget for the NHS. Over the course of this Parliament, it will go up by &#163;12.5 billion, which represents a 1.8% increase in real terms. The right hon. Member for Leigh and his party were against that.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/4">No Opposition Member recognised in the debate the simple fact that, in the first year of this Parliament, &#163;4.3 billion of efficiency savings were achieved, and performance improved, across the NHS. That was not even in the time frame for the Nicholson challenge. We have now had one year of the challenge. The target was &#163;5.9 billion of efficiency savings, and we achieved, across the NHS, &#163;5.8 billion. Things are on track, which completely refutes the shadow Secretary of State&#8217;s argument that we cannot have reform and deliver on the financial challenge at the same time. Actually, we can do both, and in addition improve performance in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon.

Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> on the South London Healthcare NHS trust. The latter said he was against changes at Queen Mary&#8217;s, Sidcup, but the former said that I did not get on with the changes soon enough. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish complains from the Opposition Front Bench that I did not have a moratorium, but the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich complains because I did have one.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/6">Let me be clear about this: I did introduce a moratorium, and the four tests. Reconfigurations that meet the four tests should go ahead, because they will improve clinical outcomes for patients, meet the needs of the people of that area, deliver on the intentions of local commissioners, and be in line with the views of the local public. If they meet the four tests, they should go ahead; if they do not, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40495" name="Karen Lumley">the Member for Redditch (Karen Lumley)</phrase> made clear in respect of Worcestershire, they should not go ahead. That much is clear.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40489" name="Stuart Andrew">the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew)</phrase> made good points on how clinical commissioning is bringing improvements in musculoskeletal services. He also rightly made it clear, as the right hon. Member for Leigh did not, that Wales does not meet anything like the same standards as England and is cutting its NHS budget by 8.4%. We are increasing resources for the NHS in England and improving it. It is expected that, by the end of this Parliament, expenditure per head for the NHS in Wales will be below that of England. That is what we get from a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/8">Let me reiterate to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40221" name="Virendra Sharma">the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40219" name="Angie Bray">the Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray)</phrase> a point I made a moment ago. The hon. Member for Ealing, Southall should admit that the plans being looked at in north-west London are entirely the same ones considered under a Labour Government before the election. I will insist that the plans are subjected to the four tests I have described. If they meet those four tests, they can go</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/9">ahead; if not, they will not. I advise him to continue making speeches in the House, but also to ask the general practitioners and clinical commissioners in Ealing what they think is in the best interests of their patients&#8212;his constituents. That is a good basis to start with.</p>
	<p pid="d.746.4/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, and a number of other hon. Members, asked about the south-west pay consortium. When I went to the NHS pay review body just a couple of months or so ago, I made it very clear that the Government believe we should do everything we can to support NHS employers to have the flexibilities in the pay framework that are necessary for them to recruit, retain and motivate staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.748.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman should not interrupt from a sedentary position. I am answering the question. Members are interested in this. When I went to the pay review body, I made it clear that, in my view, we could achieve that through negotiations on the &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221;. That continues to be my view, and the south-west pay consortium makes it clear in its documentation that it supports such a negotiation. It is right to pursue such a negotiation nationally and for local pay flexibilities to be used in the national pay framework. That is what most NHS employers do, with the exception of Southend.</p>
	<p pid="d.748.1/2">I have made it clear, as the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon.

	<p pid="d.748.3/1">No, because the south-west consortium has made no such proposal. Its document is clear: it wants the &#8220;Agenda for Change&#8221; national pay framework to give it the necessary flexibilities. My view is that we should do that, and I hope that the Opposition, along with the trade unions and the staff side, will support it. As a consequence, no proposal for the reduction of pay or the dismissal and re-engagement of staff is, in my view, desirable or necessary. Indeed, when I went to the pay review body, I made the point that I did not believe reduction of pay in the NHS to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.748.3/2">Let me conclude. There was a lot that those of us in the Chamber did not hear from Opposition Members. Much of it was in the annual report that I published just two weeks ago&#8212;waiting times below what they were at the time of the last election; the number of people waiting beyond 18 weeks cut by 50,000; the number waiting beyond a year reduced by nearly two thirds; infection rates in hospitals at their lowest ever level; cancer waiting times met; ambulance trusts all meeting the category A8 standard; 95.8% of patients seen, treated and discharged from A and E within four hours; 92% of in-patients and 95% of out-patients saying that their care was good, very good or excellent; and patients across the NHS saying that they support the NHS and believe the care they received to have been excellent. On</p>
	<p pid="d.748.3/3">that basis, the House should reject the motion as unfair in its characterisation of the NHS and wrong in its denigration of the NHS.</p>

	Adult Social Care
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.753.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" speakername="Liz Kendall" colnum="753"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071633000220">
	<p pid="d.753.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="d.753.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes the growing crisis in adult social care; welcomes many of the proposals in the Care and Support White Paper including national minimum standards on eligibility, stronger legal rights for family carers, portability of care packages and improvements to end-of-life care; notes that many of these ideas were proposed by the previous administration, but believes they are now in danger of appearing meaningless without the ability to properly fund them; is concerned that the Government is considering a cap on individual costs as high as &#163;100,000; is committed to the important Dilnot Commission principle that protection against the risks of high care costs should be provided for everyone; and calls on the Government to honour the commitment in its 2010 NHS White Paper to introduce legislation in the second session of this Parliament to establish a legal and financial framework for adult social care.</p>
	<p pid="d.753.1/3">The issue of how we provide decent care for older and disabled people and their families is one of the biggest challenges facing Britain today. Ten million people in the United Kingdom are now over 65, and that figure will rise to more than 15 million by 2030. The number of over-80s is growing even faster, and is set to double to nearly 6 million in 20 years&#8217; time. Medical advances also mean that people with disabilities are living longer than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="d.753.1/4">The fact that we as a nation are living longer is something that we should celebrate. There have been many improvements in adult social care over the past 10 years, and I shall say more about that in a moment. However, too many people still face a daily struggle to get the care and support that they need if they are disabled or become frail and vulnerable in their old age. The ways in which we provide and fund care need major reform if we are to deliver a better, fairer and more sustainable system. That reform is vital for older and disabled people and their families who want and deserve a decent system of care and support, but it is also vital for our economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s fiscal sustainability report states that the primary pressure on the public finances is our ageing population. Without major changes to pensions and, crucially, to health and social care, the long-term growth of our economy and the sustainability of our public finances could be put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.753.1/5">Last week, the Government had the chance to show that they were prepared to meet the challenge of fundamentally reforming care and support, and many of the promises in their White Paper and draft Bill on social care are welcome. They build on Labour&#8217;s achievements when we were in government. Indeed, many of the Government&#8217;s announcements were put forward by Labour in our White Paper, &#8220;Building the National Care Service&#8221;, more than two years ago. They included a shift in the focus of local council and NHS services towards prevention and early intervention to help more older and disabled people to stay living independently in their own homes, and more joined-up NHS and council care to stop families having to struggle with the different services to get the support that they need.</p>

	<p pid="d.753.2/2">Government in debate after debate to take action and to make some tough decisions to ensure that we looked after our ageing population, but, time and again, they failed to take any real action. We are not building on what they did; we are having to go into the space where they failed to act.</p>

	<p pid="d.754.0/1">I always respect the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s interventions, but he seems to forget that we faced up to those difficult decisions and choices on adult social care in &#8220;Building the National Care Service&#8221;. We tried to get cross-party agreement on those proposals, but they became a political football at the last general election. The hon. Gentleman should be encouraging those in his Front-Bench team to engage seriously in cross-party talks and to take the difficult decisions that need to be taken.</p>

	<p pid="d.754.2/1">I want to make some progress, then I will give way.</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/2">Labour proposed better information and national minimum standards to tackle the postcode lottery in care. We also proposed that everyone should have the right to have a personal budget&#8212;which we introduced&#8212;that people should be able to take their care package with them if they moved to a different area, and that carers should have the right to have their own needs assessed and met independently of the person for whom they cared.</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/3">The difference between the Labour Government and the present Government is that we set out the difficult decisions about how those changes would be paid for. The absence of that information is the gaping hole at the heart of this Government&#8217;s plans. There is a risk that their promises of new rights and services will be meaningless without the ability to fund them properly. Indeed,</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/4">&#8220;this White Paper is not worth the paper it's written on.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/5">Those are not my words, but those of the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, which has damned the White Paper as a massive failure. Similarly,</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/6">&#8220;the key test for this White Paper was to deliver an urgent timetable to reform social care funding. The Government has failed this test.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.754.2/7">Again, those are not my words. They are the words of the Care and Support Alliance, which consists of more than 65 organisations that represent and support older and disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="d.754.3/1">I entirely support the principle of a national care service, but will my hon. Friend go slightly further and be as bold as Nye Bevan in suggesting that it should be free for all at the point of need?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.754.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" speakername="Liz Kendall" colnum="754"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071633000226">
	<p pid="d.754.4/1">I know that my hon. Friend is passionately committed to this issue, and he will know that we remain determined to ensure that there is a fair, affordable and sustainable system for care and support in future.</p>
	<p pid="d.754.4/2">The Government have failed to take proper action to tackle the immediate care crisis, and they have failed to confront the difficult funding decisions that we need for the future. Last week we heard nothing but complacency</p>
	<p pid="d.754.4/3">from the Government about the desperate care crisis that faces people throughout the country. Ministers repeatedly claim that there is enough money in the system, but the truth is that the Government&#8217;s savage cuts in council budgets have pushed an already pressurised care system to breaking point.</p>
	<p pid="d.754.4/4">Adult social care accounts for about 40% of council budgets&#8212;it is up to 60% in some areas&#8212;and for the largest elements of councils&#8217; discretionary spending. When council budgets are slashed by a third, it is inevitable that care services will be cut. Figures from the Government&#8217;s own Department for Communities and Local Government show that more than &#163;1.3 billion has been cut from older people&#8217;s social care provision since the coalition came to power. Fewer people are receiving support that they desperately need as councils raise eligibility thresholds. Charges for vital services such as home help are soaring, with huge variations across the country. That is a stealth tax on the most vulnerable members of society. At the same time, the quality of care is being put at risk as councils are forced to pass on cuts in their budgets to care providers. <i>[Interruption.] </i>From a sedentary position, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase> asks what we did in 13 years. We increased spending on adult social care by 53%, we invested &#163;1.2 billion in the carers&#8217; grant, we provided new rights for carers to have their needs assessed and to request flexible working, we introduced the Supporting People programme, and we spent &#163;227 million on extra care housing. I rest my case.</p>
	<p pid="d.754.4/5">According to the United Kingdom Homecare Association, one in 10 home care visits now lasts for only 15 minutes. That is a completely inadequate amount of time if frail, vulnerable people are to be helped to get up and to be washed, dressed and fed. Residential care is under huge pressure too. Nine out of 10 home care providers say that low council fees are creating a two-tier system, with new investment being directed only towards wealthier parts of the country. Unpaid family carers are suffering as well as they are forced to give up work, and their own health suffers because they cannot obtain the help that they need to look after their loved ones. Yet the Government repeatedly deny the scale and urgency of the care crisis.</p>

	<p pid="d.755.1/1">Last week, local councils throughout the country will have listened in disbelief as Ministers repeatedly insisted that there was enough money in the system and no need for councils to cut care provision. Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative chairman of the Local Government Association, has said that the current system does not have enough money to provide care for</p>
	<p pid="d.755.1/2">&#8220;anyone other than the most needy, or those who can afford to pay for all of their own care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.755.1/3">Without more funds, he says, we will</p>
	<p pid="d.755.1/4">&#8220;see some of the most popular services councils provide, such as parks, leisure centres&#8230;winding down by the end of the decade.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.755.1/5">The Government are astonishingly complacent about the impact that cuts in social care are having on the NHS. Last week the Secretary of State for Health brushed aside concerns about delayed discharges from hospitals, saying that they were</p>
	<p pid="d.755.1/6">&#8220;broadly the same as&#8230; last year&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-11.322"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 July 2012; Vol. 548, c. 322</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="d.756.1/1">In reality, the number of days on which a hospital bed is occupied by someone who could have been discharged has risen by 18% since this time last year, and by a staggering 29% in the last 18 months. These delays now cost the NHS &#163;18.5 million every single month, and more than a third are due to cuts in social care. The number of delayed discharges from social care has risen by 11% in the last month alone.</p>
	<p pid="d.756.1/2">Instead of burying their heads in the sand, Ministers should be taking action. Labour has called for &#163;700 million from last year&#8217;s NHS underspend to be ring-fenced for social care immediately, and I was delighted to learn that the all-party group on local government today called for those funds to be used for that purpose, rather than being absorbed back into the Treasury coffers.

	<p pid="d.756.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on giving way at long last. It is nice of her to do so, and we are most grateful. Given that she began by saying that she wanted to see a consensual, non-partisan approach to the issue, can she explain why we have just heard a party political diatribe? I find that very disappointing.</p>

	<p pid="d.756.3/1">I was stating the facts about the care crisis, which have been made clear not by me but by organisations representing older and disabled people, by local councils and by the NHS. It is the Government&#8217;s denial of the existence of the care crisis and their insistence that there is enough money in the system that I am seeking to correct.</p>
	<p pid="d.756.3/2">As I have said, the Government have failed to recognise, let alone tackle, the care crisis, and they have failed to face up to the difficult decisions that we need for the future. Their progress report on funding merely says that the Government support the principles of Andrew Dilnot&#8217;s commission on the funding of long-term care and support. They now claim that it is only right for Dilnot&#8217;s proposals to be considered as part of the spending review. That was not their view two years ago, when they made a clear promise in their NHS White Paper to legislate on a new legal and financial framework in the current parliamentary Session. Now we have only a draft Bill to reform social care law alone. At best that means that there will be no change in funding before the next general election, and at worst it means no change at all if the Government return to power.</p>

	<p pid="d.756.5/1">I want to make a little more progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.756.5/2">According to yesterday&#8217;s edition of <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, Andrew Dilnot has said that the delay has left older and disabled people in fear and misery. He expressed serious concern about the possibility that the Government will set the cap at a far higher level than that proposed by his commission&#8212;at &#163;75,000 or even &#163;100,000 rather than &#163;35,000. He also said:</p>
	<p pid="d.756.5/3">&#8220;if you go beyond &#163;50,000 it is less effective in giving reassurance to the population and ceases to be a way of helping people with lower levels of assets.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.756.5/4">Instead of making real progress on funding reform, the Government trumpeted proposals for a national deferred payment scheme, providing loans to cover the costs of residential care.</p>

	<p pid="d.757.0/1">Does the hon. Lady recall what the Secretary of State actually said when he announced his proposals last week? He made it very plain that, if the hon. Lady&#8217;s party sat down seriously with Ministers and reached the consensus that the whole country is clearly crying out for, the necessary mechanisms could be introduced in the Bill and the funding could be found in the comprehensive spending review. We need less party politics and more consensual conversations.</p>

	<p pid="d.757.1/1">It was Labour Members who proposed cross-party talks, and it was Government Members who decided unilaterally to publish the progress report on which we had been trying hard to agree. The hon. Lady accuses Opposition Members of not being serious about funding reform. We are, and I will set out what we would like to happen so that those talks can proceed.</p>
	<p pid="d.757.1/2">The deferred payment schemes that were announced last week already exist in some parts of the country and are currently interest-free, but according to the Government&#8217;s plans interest will be charged, which will make loans more expensive than they are now. Many councils remain utterly unclear about how they will find the money to pay for those schemes. As the Local Government Association says,</p>
	<p pid="d.757.1/3">&#8220;Councils are not banks and the implication of this level of debt in an already overstretched system needs urgent attention.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.757.1/4">The truth is that the Government have so far ducked the care challenge, and the reasons for that are clear. First, owing to their disastrous economic policy, they are now borrowing &#163;150 billion more than they originally planned to borrow. The Treasury has pulled the plug, and has kicked long-term care funding into the long grass.</p>

	<p pid="d.757.2/1">I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. As she recognises, cross-party consensus is required if we are to solve the social care problem. Care workers&#8212;the people who actually provide the care to people&#8212;do not get sufficient attention, however. One of the problems they have suffered from over many years is per-minute billing. Does she recognise that our changes to get rid of per-minute billing are worth while, and what impact does she envisage that will have on the provision of care over the long term?</p>

	<p pid="d.757.3/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a serious point. I know from shadowing care home assistants in my constituency that commissioning by the minute can cause considerable problems. For instance, it does not allow the staff to meet the individual needs of those who are most desperate for help and support. As I have said, we welcome many of the proposals in the White Paper, but they need to be properly funded, and that is why I am so concerned that the issue of long-term care funding has been kicked into the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="d.757.3/2">The second reason why the Government have failed on this issue is that the Health Secretary&#8217;s obsession with reorganising the NHS has been a disastrous distraction.</p>
	<p pid="d.757.3/3">Two years have been wasted on an unwanted and unnecessary reorganisation, when everyone should have been relentlessly focused on the key challenge of our ageing population: meeting rising demand for care at a time of unprecedented financial pressure.</p>
	<p pid="d.757.3/4">The third reason is the most fundamental of all. Many Conservative Members have still not grasped the basic principle that we must collectively and universally pool the risks of facing catastrophic care costs, as we do in the NHS, in order to make things better and fairer for us all. A voluntary system that leaves it up to individuals and their families alone will not work. The only way forward is through an effective partnership between individuals and the state.</p>

	<p pid="d.758.0/1">I agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. The Government keep on talking about consensus, but the problem is that we say yes to Dilnot, but they do not. If they were to say yes to Dilnot, we might have a basis for consensus.</p>

	<p pid="d.758.1/1">We remain serious about trying to achieve cross-party consensus. If one party comes forward on its own and proposes a controversial and difficult decision, that always leads to a political fight; we saw that only too clearly before the last general election. However, we need cross-party consensus because this is a long-term challenge. We have to try to get agreement so that, whichever party is in power, people know there is a system that they can understand and pay for in future.</p>
	<p pid="d.758.1/2">Members on the Government Benches have criticised Labour&#8217;s record in government, but we are proud of our achievements on social care. We increased spending by 53% when we were in government. We helped drive up quality through national performance assessment of local councils and independent inspection of care services. We championed integration, with new legal powers for the NHS and local councils to pool budgets, and new care trusts to jointly commission care. Those care trusts will be swept away under the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We supported carers through the carers grant and new rights for carers. We introduced the first ever national dementia strategy, and we backed improvements in housing through the Supporting People programme and extra care housing. <i>[Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40492" name="Rob Wilson">The hon. Member for Reading East (Mr Wilson)</phrase> mutters from a sedentary position that that is not real action. He should try telling that to the carers we supported through breaks that are now under threat, and the people who have benefited from extra care housing and the Supporting People programme, which his Government have cut by 12%.</p>
	<p pid="d.758.1/3">We understood that we had much further to go, however. That is why before the last general election we published plans for fundamental reform, including difficult decisions on how care should be funded. We tried to get cross-party agreement. We did not succeed, but we are determined to try again now.</p>
	<p pid="d.758.1/4">A year ago, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made an open and sincere offer of cross-party talks, and it is a matter of genuine regret that the Government unilaterally decided to publish their own progress report on funding, rather than the joint report we had wanted to agree. Labour remains committed to serious and meaningful cross-party talks.</p>
	<p pid="d.758.1/5">I hope that the Minister will tell the House whether the Government will commit to addressing the current funding gap as well as future reform. Andrew Dilnot says that that is vital. Will they also set a clear timetable for reform, with legislation on funding reform in this Parliament, as Labour has called for? Will they agree to include their Treasury team in the talks, which Labour has offered from the start?</p>

	<p pid="d.759.0/1">One of the authors of the Dilnot report was Lord Warner, who was a member of the previous Labour Government. He made the point that one of the reasons for the funding crisis is that the previous Government failed to invest adequately in social care; it received only 70% of the funding compared with the NHS. That was one of the major failings of the previous Government. They should have invested more in social care when the sun was shining and the country had the finances to do that.</p>

	<p pid="d.759.1/1">I politely say to the hon. Gentleman that we did not cut local council budgets by a third. I have always said that social care budgets have been under increasing pressure for many years, which is why we desperately need funding reform. I know that he supports that reform and will work with us in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="d.759.1/2">The Government&#8217;s decision to kick the issue of long-term care funding into the long grass is a bitter blow for older and disabled people and their families. It is a huge disappointment for local councils, which are desperate for a new social care settlement, and it is a disaster for our NHS, which will face intolerable pressure as our care system crumbles further still. This issue will not go away, because our population is ageing. Our care system needs fundamental reform&#8212;reform this Government have so far failed to deliver. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.759.2/1">Let me begin by striking a note of agreement between Government and Opposition, before moving on to the areas where we disagree. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> that our debates about our ageing society are too often couched in terms of burdens and impacts on public expenditure, when they should be a cause for celebration as we have more people living longer and living healthier for longer. That stands as a tribute to our national health service, our local authorities and many others besides.</p>
	<p pid="d.759.2/2">I sat in the House for 13 years in opposition to a Labour Government, and it became very clear to me that, despite the wealth of the nation being much greater at that time than it is now, the Labour party was not willing to tackle the pressing need for serious systemic reform of social care. I shall talk in a moment about the Labour Government&#8217;s last-minute moves to address that agenda.</p>
	<p pid="d.759.2/3">Social care is Bevan&#8217;s orphan. It was left over after the NHS was established in the 1940s, and it has suffered ever since. It has been hidden behind its favoured sibling, the national health service, out of sight until life takes a turn and tips people into crisis. Social care&#8217;s founding principles date back to the Poor Law; it was a poor relation to the NHS, ripe for reform, but neglected for decades.</p>
	<p pid="d.759.2/4">Much of last week&#8217;s reporting about the Secretary of State&#8217;s statement in the House and the publication of the White Paper and draft Bill gave the impression that the only subject that was talked about was who pays for care&#8212;where the line is drawn between what an individual personally is responsible for in meeting their care costs and what costs the state would pick up. The Government do not dispute that that is an important issue, and we have made significant progress on that agenda, but it is not enough simply to redraw the boundary between personal responsibility and state support, because the system of social care in England is undoubtedly broken.</p>
	<p pid="d.759.2/5">Given that there were 13 years of Labour inaction, the hon. Member for Leicester West must face up to some of the challenges in respect of social care. A White Paper finally emerged in the dying days of the last Labour Government; it was published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-30">30 March</phrase>, just seven days before a general election was called. That is not good enough; it is too little too late. What did that White Paper say? It talked about national eligibility, but when? It was by 2015, so it was going to take Labour five years to introduce that change. On portability, it did not commit to ensuring that support would be provided immediately in the area to which the person was moving. In other words, there was still a risk of interruptions. In addition, that Labour White Paper said nothing about the rights of carers. The hon. Member for Leicester West was absolutely wrong when she told the House that Labour was responsible for introducing carers legislation. Back-Bench Members in this House, tirelessly arguing the case, were responsible&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members supported those many measures over a number of years, but none came from the Front-Bench and none came from the Labour Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.761.1/1">I think that the Minister has unfairly misrepresented the process we went through in the last Parliament. We did not just have a White Paper before the general election. We had a Green Paper in the summer of 2009, and the whole process was kicked off in the 2007 spending review. Upon a request from the then shadow Health Secretary, I agreed to cross-party talks. So the Minister is unfair in saying that nothing was done and then a rabbit was produced from the hat. May I say to him that the White Paper that I produced before the election addressed both service reform and funding? I am afraid that the same could not be said of the White Paper that emerged last week.</p>

	<p pid="d.761.2/1">That is interesting, because the White Paper that was published seven days before the general election was called carried no details on who should pay, what they should pay or when they should pay. It contained no details of that sort, and I urge people to read it and compare it with the White Paper, draft Bill and other details that we published just last week. In 13 years, when the money was available, the Labour Government did not do anything; they left it until the last seven days and even then did not come up with the details.</p>
	<p pid="d.761.2/2">In the space of two years, this coalition Government have advanced further and faster than any in the previous 20 years on addressing a wide range of issues and challenges and backing that with tangible action. Unlike what happened with Labour&#8217;s royal commission, so firmly kicked into the long grass, this Government have accepted all the recommendations of the Dilnot commission as the basis for a reformed system. Many of those recommendations are translated into the legislation that we published last week. Crucially, the Government accept the principles of a capped cost system as the basis for protecting people from catastrophic costs. Labour&#8217;s motion seems to suggest that Labour does, too. I want to make it clear that we are keen, still, to engage with the official Opposition and other stakeholders in reaching a final settlement on this question of the boundary between the state&#8217;s responsibility and the individual family&#8217;s responsibilities for meeting care costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.761.3/1">Does the Minister not recognise that any cap, be it at &#163;35,000 or &#163;60,000, as was initially proposed by Dilnot, is likely within a very short time to be wholly inadequate, given the funding constraints that we are under? The harsh reality is that people who wish to preserve an inheritance for their children&#8212;that is an understandable desire&#8212;must recognise, as must their children, that those children will have to take on the burden of looking after aged parents, in both time and financial terms. It sounds like a hard truth, but it needs to be put on the record, because otherwise we are not going to get any further forward in dealing with this matter.</p>

	<p pid="d.762.0/1">The hon. Gentleman expresses an opinion that is held by many people, but the Government&#8217;s position is not to take that view. We take the view that a cap on care costs is an important component in a redesigned system for funding in this country. What we have said clearly is that we have to address how that is paid for as part of a spending review. That is why we believe that both a cap and an increase in the means-test threshold provides the necessary assurance for a family to plan and prepare for care, and provides the mechanisms by which the financial services industry can grow and develop to offer appropriate products.</p>

	<p pid="d.762.1/1">Is there not a problem with what the Minister has said? I understand that this is an incredibly difficult issue, which we all have to deal with. I have lost both my parents. One died at the age of 70, only 18 months ago, at a time when we were on the cusp of putting her into full-time care, which would have been ruinously expensive. Is not the problem with all this that if we put in place today any system with a fixed cap, it will almost certainly be superseded by events and will then be seen as unjust for future generations?</p>

	<p pid="d.762.2/1">The hon. Gentleman identifies one of the issues associated with the design of the introduction of a cap. It is worth pointing out that the interaction between the cap and the means-test threshold means that every family would have a different level for which they would be liable to meet their care costs. The issues relating to design are real, as are those about how to meter the system from the point someone enters it, and they require detailed work as part of the design of an effective implementation alongside the costings of it.</p>

Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> is right to identify that there is a link between inheritance and the high cost of end-of-life care for people. May I put it to the Minister that if there is a cap of &#163;100,000, the entire inheritance could be wiped out for a family who have a modest home in the north of England, whereas somebody living in a home worth 10 times as much in southern England would still maintain a large proportion to pass on?</p>

	<p pid="d.762.4/1">That is why we have to explain this clearly. By lifting the means-test threshold to &#163;100,000, the interaction between the absolute cap and the means test means that the amount the individual will ultimately pay as their lifetime contribution towards their care costs is related to their wealth. I urge the hon. Gentleman again to look at both the tables and the graphs in the progress report, as he will see exactly how it protects the assets of a family, even in the scenario he has described.</p>
	<p pid="d.762.4/2">It is also important to understand that redrawing the boundary between what the individual pays and what the state pays does not&#8212;things all too often were conflated in this way last week&#8212;add any new spending power to the system. That leads me to the question of getting funding into the system. Before the 2010 spending review, the Dilnot commission urged the Government to protect baseline funding for social care, and we did just that. In October 2010, we confirmed an extra &#163;7.2 billion of support for adult social care, which, together with a programme of efficiency, was sufficient to protect access to support. That included an unprecedented &#163;4.2 billion</p>
	<p pid="d.762.4/3">of NHS resources to support social care, to promote integration and innovation, and to support the expansion of reablement services. The Labour party wants to paint a picture of doom and gloom up and down England on these services, tarring every council with the same brush of being crude cutters of services, when that is not the case.</p>

	<p pid="d.763.0/1">Perhaps I could describe to the Minister what is happening in Trafford, which has a Conservative council and is where my constituency is located. We are seeing a twin squeeze, despite the Minister&#8217;s apparent sanguinity about the funding. On the one hand, we are seeing thresholds for access to care being raised as a means of rationing the way in which the money is spent. On the other hand, as care providers are telling me, commissioners are reducing and reducing the price they are prepared to pay providers to the point where they can hardly sustain their business at all or meet minimum wage legislation.</p>

	<p pid="d.763.1/1">We know from the surveys that although last year there was a cash freeze in the increases that local authorities paid to provider organisations, this year across the country the average was a 1.4% increase. Again, that does not quite tally with the picture that some hon. Members want to paint.</p>
	<p pid="d.763.1/2">It is also worth saying that the picture of local authorities grappling with tough budget settlements is complex. Different councils are responding to the pressures on budgets in different ways. Some are acting in a very smart way, as the Demos report, &#8220;Coping with the Cuts&#8221;, revealed. Such councils are protecting access by focusing on reablement services, helping more people to get back on their feet without the need for long-term support, which is better for the individual and more cost-effective. Indeed, the latest figures from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services reveal that councils are protecting front-line care.</p>

	<p pid="d.763.2/1">Would the Minister agree to look closely at the report of the all-party local government group on social care, published today? It makes very clear that a funding gap still exists and recommends that NHS money should be used to plug that gap. Will the Minister commit to continuing to do that and to considering the other recommendations in the report?</p>

	<p pid="d.763.3/1">Obviously, I will happily look at the report and I look forward to meeting the all-party group to discuss its findings and recommendations later.</p>
	<p pid="d.763.3/2">I want to report to the House the findings of the ADASS survey, which was published recently. Last year&#8217;s survey found that for every pound saved by local authorities in social care, 69p came through greater efficiency. This year, it found that that had risen to 77p in every pound. Yes, some councils are cutting services, and last year 23p in every pound that councils saved came from service reductions, but this year that figure is just 13p in every pound. Local authorities are getting smarter in organising their services, so I want to pay tribute to those councils and councillors who have worked hard with service users, carers and providers to protect services to make the best possible use of the extra money the</p>
	<p pid="d.763.3/3">Government have provided. As a result, between last year and this year, council budget spend on social services has gone down by just 1%.</p>

	<p pid="d.764.0/1">On the question of efficiencies, would the Minister include councils that tendered a service and made a saving, but to the detriment of the end user of the service? That is how we got to the 15-minute, short-term care options. Is that an efficiency or a cut in service?</p>

	<p pid="d.764.1/1">When there is a crude race to the bottom and contracting is by the minute simply to ration access to the service, resulting in a care home provider or home care provider delivering care on a very time-and-task oriented basis, that is totally unacceptable. We know that in places such as Wiltshire, where home care services are organised on an outcomes basis, that is delivering better results for the service users and releasing resources to reinvest in services.</p>

	<p pid="d.764.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her question, because it allows me to talk about some of the points I think will directly address it. Reform of our care and support system is about more than just who pays for care; it is also about some other very important issues. A central proposition in the White Paper we published last week concerns the move from a service focused on managing crisis, and often not doing so very</p>
	<p pid="d.764.5/2">well, to one focused on supporting people&#8217;s well-being by concentrating on early intervention and prevention. That is why, alongside the White Paper, we published a draft Bill that will underpin the reforms we intend to make, consolidating, simplifying and modernising the legislation. The Bill sets out for the first time in statute some very clear governing principles about how decisions are made in social care, focusing on people&#8217;s well-being and living by the idea set out by our first White Paper in government of &#8220;No decision about me, without me&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.764.5/3">The Bill sets out a number of important changes that go to the heart of people being able to plan, prepare and have proper choice about the care available to them. First, it makes it a requirement for local authorities to ensure that there is a universal offer of information and advice so that people can plan and prepare. Secondly, it requires for the first time local authorities to focus on prevention. Thirdly, it requires a sufficiency of quality care so that choice is available to people locally. Fourthly, it requires integration and co-operation not just between the NHS and social care but between those agencies and housing.</p>
	<p pid="d.764.5/4">The Bill will not only do that; it will simplify the point of entry into the state system. It will ensure consistent national eligibility and, for the first time in Government legislation, will ensure that there are rights for carers not just to an assessment of their needs but to support for those needs. It will also deal with the often mentioned issue of protection from disruption when people move from one part of the country to another or when a child moves from children&#8217;s services to adult services. It will guarantee continuity of services, which is not currently provided for.</p>
	<p pid="d.764.5/5">Personal budgets, which were started by the Opposition but have not stuck well because of the legal framework, will for the first time be given a clear legal basis. I am delighted to say that whereas when this Government came to office in 2010 we inherited 168,000 people receiving personal budgets, by March of this year 432,000 people were benefiting from them. There will also be clear legal duties on the NHS, police and councils to safeguard people.</p>
	<p pid="d.764.5/6">At the heart of our White Paper reforms is the notion that we need less variability on quality, to ensure that providers are responsible for driving up quality and accountable for doing just that, and to have more and open information about the quality of provision. That is why our provider quality profiles will provide that information in a way that will allow people to compare and rate providers for the first time and why we are putting an extra &#163;32.5 million in to support those services.</p>

	<p pid="d.765.1/1">I will come on to give a specific figure in a moment, so the right hon. Gentleman will have to be patient.</p>
	<p pid="d.765.1/2">I wanted to pick up again on the point about the White Paper ruling out crude contracting by the minute&#8212;a culture of clock-watching which has been allowed to grow up for years in too many places and which is not good for dignity, respect or quality. Under the Labour Government there were years and years of delay and dither when it came to addressing the quality of care workers and health care assistants. This Government are putting in place a code of conduct and national minimum training standards, and will double the number of people able to access apprenticeships in the care sector to 100,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.766.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks.

	<p pid="d.766.1/1">On the proposals for portability of assessment and guaranteed continuity of care, the LGA is certainly aware and has been engaged in the consultations that we undertook last year as part of our preparations for the White Paper. It did not, of course, negotiate line by line the text of the White Paper, but it has the opportunity, as does everyone else, to participate now in the scrutiny of the draft Bill that we introduced. I hope the LGA will do so. We wish to engage with the LGA on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.766.1/2">Integration is an important part of these reforms. Too often, people feel bounced around the system. What we do for the first time in the White Paper is set out a number of important steps towards more integration of the two existing systems.</p>

	<p pid="d.766.2/1">The Minister has used the term &#8220;integration&#8221; several times. In Northern Ireland we have an integrated health and social care system, which is working extremely well.

	<p pid="d.766.3/1">From my own limited study of the system and from visits that I have made over the years, one of the conclusions that I would draw, which is at the heart of our reforms as well, relates to culture and collaborative behaviour across the various parts of the system. That has been essential to delivering genuinely integrated care in some parts of Northern Ireland. I believe it is essential to delivering genuinely integrated care in England as well.</p>
	<p pid="d.766.3/2">I mentioned earlier that end-of-life care was an omission from the Labour Government&#8217;s last White Paper. It has not been omitted from ours. We are doubling the budget of the pilots that we have instituted to test the patient funding mechanisms and to make sure that we have the necessary data to understand the benefits of a free social care system at end of life. We want to make it</p>
	<p pid="d.766.3/3">clear that we see the merits of such a change, and it is why we want to make sure that we have the information on which we can base the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.766.3/4">Our goal is to shift the focus of the system to prevention and early intervention, not to wait for the system to stutter into life when a crisis strikes. We want to make it easier for people to plan and prepare, both to avoid and reduce the need for care and to meet the need for care in the first place. Last week we laid out a reform agenda of universal information and advice, national eligibility, deferred payments, integration of health, housing and social care, better transition for children to adult services, and support for carers. Together those constitute the most comprehensive overhaul of adult social care in 60 years, and they are a contrast to the motion before us, which adds nothing, says nothing about how change will be paid for, and says all that it can to scare people about the current system.</p>
	<p pid="d.766.3/5">Rather like 13 years of a Labour Government, today&#8217;s motion gets us nowhere. That is why we are investing an extra &#163;300 million in the system to support change, and why I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the motion.</p>

	<p pid="d.767.2/2">The whole thrust of this Government has been to shrink the state, but Dilnot will clearly expand it. The Chancellor, who torpedoed Labour&#8217;s social care proposals just before the last election by claiming that they represented a death tax, is now supporting his own death tax, only this time it will be &#163;35,000 to &#163;50,000, as opposed to Labour&#8217;s &#163;20,000. Now the Chancellor has once again sabotaged a fair and reasonable inter-party settlement, which is plainly needed, by abruptly breaking off the talks and introducing a pretty vacuous White Paper with no costs in it&#8212;or, to use the words of Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1964, a menu without the prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.767.2/3">Furthermore, the Chancellor clearly wants the adult social scheme to be voluntary&#8212;I think this is what lies behind many of the difficulties&#8212;but the sums add up only if there is compulsory risk pooling. Yet the Chancellor&#8212;it is he, rather than the Secretary of State, whom we must deal with&#8212;still will not face up to the ineluctable logic of a mandatory adult social care system, and he is still trying to dodge it in two rather unscrupulous ways: first, he is kicking it into the long grass by postponing it to the uncertainties of the next spending review in 2014, even though gross neglect is endemic and reform is needed urgently; and secondly, he is evading today&#8217;s realities by ignoring any need for upgrading standards. The Minister referred to upgrading standards, and clearly he wants to, but the means with which to do so are incompatible with the White Paper. The Treasury&#8217;s &#163;1.7 billion is purely a dead-weight cost to protect</p>
	<p pid="d.767.2/4">family inheritances. It takes no account of rising care costs or the imperative need to lift care standards, which in many cases shame a civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="d.767.2/5">This is where we come to the crux of the matter. At present, many local authorities pay only for 15-minute or 30-minute visits, and many do not pay for the journey time, even though that is part of the contract, or the petrol costs, which care providers are obliged to provide themselves. Frankly, it is impossible in 15 or 30 minutes to get an elderly and often infirm person out of bed, to clean the sheets, which may well be soiled, to get him or her dressed, washed and fed, to clean and tidy up and, of course, to engage in some kind of conversation to generate some decent human relationship. Equally, it is impossible, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> pointed out, with the minimum wage rates paid by local authorities because of their squeezed budgets&#8212;a funding shortfall of at least &#163;1 billion this year&#8212;for care providers to offer the higher standards the Minister talked about and which they want to provide and which the service users deserve.</p>
	<p pid="d.767.2/6">How is the big black hole in the White Paper to be dealt with? The Local Government Association says that the gap between the money available this year and the predicted cost is about &#163;1.4 billion, stretching to &#163;16.5 billion by 2020, when spending on social care will exceed 45% of council budgets. Against that shortfall, the &#163;300 million of extra funding announced by the Secretary of State in his statement last Wednesday looks derisory.</p>
	<p pid="d.767.2/7">This dilemma is by no means insoluble. The long-term costs of Dilnot are estimated at about &#163;3 billion a year. In his Budget four months ago, the Chancellor had a choice in the allocation of precisely such a sum, but he decided to spend it on the top 1% earning more than &#163;3,000 a week by cutting the 50p rate of tax. For the same amount of money he could have funded Dilnot in full, but for this Chancellor the priority are the super-rich, not the elderly, infirm or disabled people in need of social care. The long-term answer to this problem is the introduction of a new social insurance scheme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.768.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" speakername="Fiona Bruce" colnum="768"  time="020:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071633000277">
	<p pid="d.768.0/1">I welcome the Government&#8217;s White Paper &#8220;Caring for our future: reforming care and support&#8221; and its priority of putting the well-being of the cared for and their carers at the heart of its approach. As the Member who represents the constituency with the highest proportion of elderly people in the north-west of England&#8212;there are 72,000 carers in Cheshire&#8212;I particularly welcome the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/2">For the first time there will be a clear legal basis for the cared for and their carers having their own individual care and support plans, a tangible recognition of the utterly invaluable contribution that some 6 million carers make, many of whom often work more than 50 hours a week, at great personal cost. With 2 million people moving in and out of caring roles each year, the Government are right to recognise that giving carers a right to personal assessments and plans is a priority so that their own health and well-being are supported and recognition is given to the fact that they, too, have lives to live.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/3">I am also pleased that the Government have already allocated &#163;400 million for carers&#8217; breaks over the current five-year period, but it is important that that is reviewed</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/4">to ensure that the effectiveness of such payments is maximised. I welcome the new duties placed on local authorities, which will substantially help the cared for and their carers to access appropriate support, as the fragmented health, housing and care support services that have existed until now have caused at best frustration, and at worst despair.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/5">Clearer dissemination, and the duty on local councils to provide advice and preventive services, should go a long way towards alleviating the problem described by one volunteer in the care sector, when she said that social workers just do not have time to help signpost carers to information, advice and support.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/6">The Government are to be commended for their commitment to work towards the assurance of quality care standards through improved training provision for care workers, the introduction of a new code of conduct and of minimum standards for care workers and the appointment of a chief social worker, and for their aim of doubling the number of care apprenticeships to 100,000 by 2017. In that respect, I commend the excellent work of the apprentices on Cheshire East council&#8217;s A-Team, who are already blazing a trail through their apprenticeships as carers for the elderly in our community &#8212;soundly rebutting the myth that younger people do not care for our elderly or give them the dignity and respect they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/7">I also welcome the Government&#8217;s proposals to fund adaptations to keep the homes of the elderly safe, because the NHS is estimated to spend &#163;600 million a year treating injuries caused by hazards in inappropriate housing&#8212;the majority of cases associated with falls. The Government&#8217;s new care and support housing fund of &#163;200 million over five years, to support the development of specialised housing and adaptations of homes, is particularly welcome.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/8">I welcome also the Government&#8217;s commitment to abolish per-minute billing for care visits. That will be music to the ears of a distressed care worker who came to my surgery and said that she was seriously considering leaving the profession, because not only was she unable to provide within the time frame allocated the care needed for those she visited, but there was nothing like the necessary allocation of travel time between the homes that she needed to visit. In some cases, they were even in different towns. She showed me her timetable, and I can only say that I entirely agreed with her.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/9">I welcome in particular in the White Paper the Government&#8217;s recognition that if we are to address this massive challenge and make a reality of good quality, comprehensive care provision for all, which I am sure is everyone&#8217;s aspiration across the House, we will do so only if we harness the energy, resource and skills of the whole community, including community groups, many of which are highly professional and which work very hard to support carers and the cared-for.</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/10">I am very pleased that the Government have committed to working closely with Age Action Alliance jointly to find practical approaches to improving the lives of older people; that they have decided to invest funds through Big Society Capital, so that social enterprises, charities and voluntary groups can access greater resources in order to make a difference in communities; and that they have decided to involve those communities in strategic decisions on health and care services through</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/11">local health and wellbeing boards. That will be particularly welcomed by Crossroads Care Cheshire East, whose director told me, shortly after I was elected in 2010, that</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/12">&#8220;we could do so much more and add so much value if we were more involved in strategic discussions about care provision.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.768.0/13">The Government&#8217;s proposals in the White Paper are to be welcomed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.770.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="770"  time="020:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071633000278">
	<p pid="d.770.0/1">In 1989 I became a care worker after losing my job as a coal miner. I did so almost by mistake, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made, and over the next 16 years, as a care worker and as a representative of people working in care, I came to realise that we can look at care in three ways: we can provide none, provide it on the cheap or provide quality. We cannot do a combination of the three, and I hope that in the Chamber tonight we all agree that, if we are going to do quality care, we need to look after the work force properly, train them properly, treat them like professionals, have them in numbers, respect them, treat them with dignity, have the resources in place and give them some responsibility. They respond to that if allowed to, and the best way they respond is by showing respect for, and treating with dignity, the people they are taking care of, building the trust and confidence not just of those they are caring for but of their carers&#8212;their family and their friends who look after them.</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/2">I believe that my Government did some good things over their 13 years in office, regardless of what the Minister says, but in truth we did not do enough. In 1999 we set up the Sutherland commission, but we backed down on it&#8212;we chickened out. We did the right thing in Scotland, and, yes, it was done under coalition government, but the commission was set up by a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/3">We should have done more, and we have a chance today to do more. My view is clear: why is someone needing care because they cannot take care of themselves different from someone who needs care because they are ill? We never say to anyone who needs physical or mental care on the NHS that they cannot have it, but we do say that to people who cannot take themselves to the toilet, bath themselves or take their medication. We would never do that with children, so why should we do it with the elderly and disabled?</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/4">I am clear that there is a cost; of course there is. I want to ask the Minister about some of the things he was saying earlier, and I hope that I get a response. What resources are we going to put in? If there are to be 100,000 apprentices, what will that cost? If there is to be a new code of conduct, what is the implication of that? If there is to be extra training, what will that cost? All those things are welcome, but if we are just going to talk about them and not resource them, we might as well not bother to talk about them.</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/5">I would like to have clear in my mind the issue raised by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase>. What is the difference between what is now proposed and the death tax that the current Secretary of State so cleverly used during the last election to undermine the stuff that my Government were trying to do? He talked then about &#163;8,000 a year and a saving of &#163;40,000 for everyone. That has all disappeared&#8212;it is all under the carpet. Did he mean what he was saying back then and does he mean what he is saying now?</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/6">Yes, if we are going to do this properly, there will be a cost&#8212;but we always find the cost of going to war and of extending the nuclear deterrent. In the past week, we have found the cost of taking 3,500 troops off duty to save the embarrassment of the Home Secretary. If we can do all that for those reasons, why can we not do it to take care of the elderly, vulnerable and frail in this country?</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/7">We were attacked by the Minister, who said that Labour MPs were moaning and whining on. That is part of the game that we play in this place, but what about what other people are saying? The Care and Support Alliance says that</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/8">&#8220;the social care system faces collapse&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/9">while the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society says:</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/10">&#8220;Millions of vulnerable people had been promised vital reform but today they are being massively let down.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/11">Mencap says:</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/12">&#8220;this promising blue print will never get off the ground if it fails to address the chronic underfunding in social care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/13">Finally, the UK Home Care Association says:</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/14">&#8220;The Coalition Government&#8217;s White Paper has failed the frail and disabled&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/15">Those are those organisations&#8217; words&#8212;not mine, and not my party&#8217;s.</p>
	<p pid="d.770.0/16">Like other Opposition Members, I believe that the only real answer is a care system funded from general taxation. We have a generational chance to make this a crusade, just as 60 years ago people in this House made a crusade for the NHS. I know that some Government Members will say that that has been anathema, because ultimately the NHS&#8212;when we get down to the bare bones&#8212;is socialism in action. It is socialism delivering for the people of this country. What I want would be exactly that&#8212;the strong providing for the weak, not the weak being let down by the strong. We have the chance to do that. It is a challenge for this generation. The question for all of us on both sides of the House is: are we up for it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.771.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="771"  time="020:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0003.htm#12071633000279">
	<p pid="d.771.0/1">I want to be constructive. I fear that this debate may take a different route from that taken in the recent consensual Back-Bench debate. We all recognise that the cost of adult social care is a problem not just for this country, but for every advanced society that we can think of. The outline is fairly familiar: funders, private and public, feel stretched and frightened by demographic change and the elderly are scared and anxious about mounting costs. Treasuries throughout the world are nervous whenever the issue crops up, and normally they vacillate. Last week, the Government were, in part, accused of that&#8212;of dragging their feet.</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/2">That is nothing new. Back in 2009, following the publication of the Green Paper, there was very much the same thing. The current Secretary of State, who was then the shadow Secretary of State, said:</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/3">&#8220;One debate always seems to roll into another with this Government. We need a decision, and we need serious, costed proposals to be the basis for that decision.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/4">The current shadow Secretary of State, then the Secretary of State, said:</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/5">&#8220;we are putting forward three broad options for the country to debate, and it would be wrong to force the pace of that debate.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/6">For the Liberal Democrats, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40443" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> said that the Green Paper</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/7">&#8220;comes 12 years too late. It is this Government&#8217;s shameful legacy that they will leave office having failed to reform a system that the Secretary of State&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/8">now the shadow Secretary of State&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/9">&#8220;himself has described as a cruel lottery.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-07-14.160"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 July 2009; Vol. 496, c. 160-62</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/10">When social care is viewed as a sustainable enterprise, Governments always see it as involving a big&#8212;and, worse still, an uncertain&#8212;sum, and that is why Treasuries usually baulk at it and we make very little progress. Governments are far happier in clarifying people&#8217;s rights and then passing the buck to local authorities. What paralyses Governments is the potential, not the identifiable, cost&#8212;what it is and how we are going to share it out &#8212;and that amounts to a huge political headache.</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/11">In order to resolve this, we need to do two things. First, obviously, we need to get a handle on the costs; but secondly, we need to work out a way of trying to defray them. Elderly people to whom I have spoken following our recent debates and last week&#8217;s statement have spoken in slightly different terms from how we speak here. They are sceptical about some of the Armageddon scenarios. They are resentful about their perceived lack of contribution to society&#8212;not in the past but currently. They do not see themselves, en bloc, as a drag on society.</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/12">We know that some people incur massive costs because they are frail, disabled, suffer with dementia and so on, and the social, personal and family costs are appreciable, but we also know of many pensioners who make a huge family and social commitment, and some who are even in employment. My predecessor, Lord Fearn, still has a delivery round of 500 copies of &#8220;Focus&#8221;, as does his wife, and they are both in their 80s. That shows the benefits of delivering &#8220;Focus&#8221;. We do not know enough, and need to know more, about how we get people into the category of the fit and keep them out of the category of the frail. We need to know why people end up in one category or the other and what the relative costs are of maintaining them there in terms of drugs, treatment and so on. We do not know whether by advocating an active, healthy old age we are deferring costs or eradicating them. The science of gerontology has an appreciable way to go. It is not clear to me, and probably not to many Members, how public health can move people into the better category of the fit and away from the category of the long-term frail.</p>
	<p pid="d.771.0/13">My main point&#8212;to some extent it is not mine, as it was suggested to me by what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40556" name="Laura Sandys">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys)</phrase> said in a previous debate&#8212;is that even if we accept that there is no way of avoiding the cost of the last years of life and the fact that as people get older their maintenance gets more expensive in terms of calls on the NHS, there is a case for considering whether we should do some serious number-crunching to re-engineer social care in order to sharpen up and prioritise interventions, as we have seen with dementia and arthritis. We do not know at this stage what the true benefits of that could be. I am not quite sure what I mean by re-engineering social care even as I say it, but we need to find out what it means and try to implement it in order to defray the costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.773.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.773.0/2">I am often contacted by my elderly constituents and their families about social care and its funding, and I can tell the House that it is a massive worry to many of them. While I welcome many of the &#8220;in principle&#8221; recommendations in the Government&#8217;s White Paper, their lack of commitment to reforming the long-term funding of social care means, in effect, that they are kicking this urgent reform into the long grass. Dilnot recommended capping social care contributions at &#163;35,000 and increasing the means-tested savings figure to &#163;100,000. Supporting that in principle is all well and good, but the fact that the Government are not proposing anything specific until the 2013 comprehensive spending review and not implementing anything this side of the general election means that thousands of my constituents will continue to face anxiety about the potential cost of their social care and a substantial loss of their lifetime savings. One in 10 of them will face catastrophic social care costs of over &#163;100,000. That is not acceptable and shows that the Government are out of touch and ducking the issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.773.0/3">Social care funding is in crisis. Councils across the country have been forced to cut &#163;1 billion from social care. In Ealing, the Labour council has had its overall budget cut by 30%. With a substantial proportion of its budget being spent on adult social care, it is struggling to protect the most vulnerable, who depend day in, day out on the social care that it provides. It has found 70% of the &#163;85 million that it must cut over four years from efficiencies and has cut a smaller percentage from adult social care to try to protect the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="d.773.0/4">The spend on social care is decreasing while the number of elderly people in need of social care is increasing. The Local Government Association recently released a report on local government financing that made it clear that with the elderly population and the cost of social care both increasing, unless the Government reform social care funding urgently, by the end of the decade, councils will be able to pay only for social care and all other council services, such as refuse collections, will have to stop. That is not a sustainable situation for social care or for other council services. The Government cannot afford to do what they have done in this White Paper. They have not grasped the financial nettle, but have kicked social care funding into the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="d.773.0/5">One action that the Government could take immediately would be to use some of the &#163;1.7 billion underspend from the NHS&#8212;&#163;1.4 billion of which has been returned to the Treasury&#8212;to tackle the funding crisis in social care. Labour is sensibly calling for &#163;700 million of that underspend to be given to councils immediately to tackle the crisis in social care funding. That would be a significant step that would help my constituents who have social care needs. The need for a long-term funding solution is critical. I hope that the Government will engage urgently in all-party talks so that a solution can be found without further delay. I therefore support the motion.</p>

	<p pid="d.773.1/1">I will start my contribution with some points that I wanted to make earlier in the debate about the origin of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.773.1/2">I accept that there are severe problems with adult social care. I do not know where <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> got her figures about the last Government&#8217;s record on adult social care spending, but according to local government figures, between 2004 and 2010, spending increased by 0.1%. Meanwhile, the population of over-65s grew by 7.7% and the number of over-80s by 11.6%.</p>

	<p pid="d.774.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for being more generous with her time than perhaps I was. I got my figures from an independent assessment of Labour&#8217;s record in Government that was produced by the King&#8217;s Fund before the last general election.</p>

	<p pid="d.774.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for clarifying that. According to local government statistics, in the six years up to 2010, the spend was flat, and I have mentioned the demographic pressures. Interestingly, the same analysis states that over the same time, NHS expenditure rose by 27%, expenditure on the police rose by 20%, and even expenditure on schools rose by 12%.</p>
	<p pid="d.774.1/2">A picture is emerging of the deprioritising of adult social care under the last Government. That is the origin of the problem that we are debating. That is what gave rise to the restrictions of the eligibility criteria for care. Long before this Government came to office, many local authorities started to restrict eligibility to those in moderate need of care and then to those in critical need of care.</p>

	<p pid="d.774.4/1">I appreciate it.</p>
	<p pid="d.774.4/2">May I suggest that in criticising the last Government, the hon. Lady needs also to look at the record of the Government before that? Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the social care and health service budgets were drastically reduced to a degree that was an embarrassment to this country.</p>

	<p pid="d.774.5/1">I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s intervention, but I will move on to the present day, relevant though the NHS and social care budgets of 20 or 30 years ago no doubt are.</p>
	<p pid="d.774.5/2">We are beset by problems, although I was pleased to hear the Minister confirm that according to ADASS, social care spending has gone down by just 1% in the past year. Given the incredibly difficult economic situation that we are in, much of which we inherited from the previous Government, that is an achievement. However, we do have problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.774.5/3">People value their independence, and most older people want to stay in their own home. With the right support, many can. To a large extent, the White Paper proposals will provide the support that is needed to enable more people to stay at home. Carers are a vital source of people&#8217;s ability to maintain their independence at home, and the 5 million carers who do an incredibly important job in our country do not get enough support at the moment. I welcome the extra money that is being put towards enabling them to have respite, because carers tell me that a break is what they need first and foremost. I am sure that no amount of money would</p>
	<p pid="d.774.5/4">ever be enough to give them the breaks and support that they need, but at least the White Paper proposals will provide some support.</p>
	<p pid="d.774.5/5">Many people do not realise that social care is means-tested until they get to the point in their lives at which they need it. That means that we need more information to be available. We need to be honest with people about what is possible, what is available and what is not. All Governments are guilty of putting the best picture forward, which is sometimes misleading. I applaud the Government&#8217;s decision to commit &#163;32.5 million to improving information, but perhaps I can make a plea on behalf of some of my older constituents: that investment should not all be online. Many older people do not communicate in that way, so we must allow for some leaflets in GPs&#8217; surgeries, libraries and day centres, and for other traditional forms of communication. Otherwise, we will make older people who do not engage with new media even more dependent on other people to get information for them.</p>

	<p pid="d.775.1/1">No, I promised not to take any more interventions, because I know other Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.1/2">Then there is the dreaded assessment. Older people often try hard at their assessment to suggest that they can do more than they really can, especially when their carers are present. At the moment, assessments are conducted inconsistently not just around the country but within communities&#8212;it depends on who conducts them. I applaud the initiative to make them far more universal and consistent. The Dilnot proposal of making them portable around the country is certainly a huge step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.1/3">As Members of all parties have indicated, the quality of care needs to improve. I welcome the emphasis on dignity and respect that runs through the White Paper. It is important that we have better training for care workers and an end, if possible, to the terrible business of contracting by the minute, which flies in the face of dignity. I quite agree with other hon. Members that it is impossible to get an elderly person out of bed and dressed in the amount of time that is allocated these days.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.1/4">Dignity and respect are at the heart of a good-quality care system, and I am pleased that that has been given the prominence that it deserves in the White Paper. Of course we would like to do more, but I applaud the Government for making a very good start and, if I may say so to Opposition Members, they have done so within two and a half years of coming to office, which is a great improvement on the previous Government, who took 12 years before they got round to the same point.</p>

	<p pid="d.775.2/1">Adult social care is probably one of the biggest, if not the biggest, challenges that we as politicians and policy makers face. We have heard from thoughtful contributions from Members on both sides of the House explaining why it is so difficult. If people are fortunate they never need to access adult care. If they are unfortunate they do need to do so, or members of their family do. As we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase>, it can be cruel</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/2">lottery. One of our purposes should be to minimise the extent of that lottery and maximise entitlement and support for all individuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/3">One of the most humbling experiences I have had since becoming Member of Parliament for Scunthorpe was going to visit a constituent in his home last week on this very issue of care and support. He is a similar age to me. When he was younger, near the end of his training in the medical profession, he went out into the sea and suffered a terrible accident. As a result, he was paralysed from the neck down. Since then, he contributed to society in a number of different ways. He retrained in higher education until he was advised by his GP to retire because if he did not, in the GP&#8217;s words, &#8220;the wheels would come off&#8221; and he would no longer be able to contribute to society.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/4">After going to see my constituent, he wrote to me&#8212;this is about individuals and real people&#8217;s lives&#8212;about the publication of the draft social care bill:</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/5">&#8220;I have just been reading the latest on social care funding on the BBC website&#8212;it would seem that meaningful cross-party dialogue re Andrew Dilnot&#8217;s recommendations has broken down and that the government wants to put decisions off until the spending review late next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/6">My suspicions about kicking into the long grass appear justified!...I have already contributed over &#163;60000 towards my care package and seem to be paying more and more each year&#8212;despite the fact that North Lincolnshire council reduce the value of my care package every time there is a review.</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/7">My condition has not improved. I am, in fact, starting to suffer more and more of the long term complications that inevitably hit ageing tetraplegics.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/8">The worry and concern are there. When visiting my constituent in his home, I observed that the people who were providing the care were brought in at his expense. Resources were not adequate, because that cost was being taken out of his small pension from working in higher education, which went up by 5% a couple of weeks ago, although the contribution to North Lincolnshire council went up by 25%. What is the incentive to do the right thing in difficult circumstances when those sort of things happen?</p>
	<p pid="d.775.2/9">What I have described was additional care. The core care was provided by my constituent&#8217;s mother, who was in her mid 80s, and his sister, who travelled for two and a half hours to spend half the week helping to care for him. As politicians, we need to step up to the plate. It is about leadership&#8212;cross-party leadership&#8212;and being able to do the right thing for people, such as my constituent, who suffer misfortune. Had that misfortune occurred, as he said to me, in a car crash, he would have received insurance compensation, which would pay for his care package. Because it took place in a situation of utmost tragedy&#8212;nobody was responsible for it, but it was a total misfortune&#8212;there is no underpinning support from the state, which should properly protect him and his family from having to pay more and more money. My plea is for us to show the leadership across the parties&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.776.1/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>, as I completely agree that this issue is</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/2">about leadership. Some of my hon. Friends alluded to a better-tempered debate, such as the Back-Bench business debate, to which all parties made thoughtful contributions, based on a great deal of expertise from different walks of life&#8212;whether from people in the medical profession, those who had spent their life in social services or those who had a personal point of view from being a carer. We heard some heartfelt contributions in that debate, so I think we are united in the desire to do something about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/3">What I have found deeply disappointing about today is the fact that this debate was called in the first place. There was significant and genuine desire by this coalition Government to solve once and for all this problem that everyone agrees needs to be solved. Everyone agrees that it needs cross-party support&#8212;for reasons that are obvious to anyone sitting in the Gallery or watching this evening&#8217;s debate and to all the various voluntary organisations that have been very substantially misquoted or very selectively quoted this evening. There is a unity of purpose, but it is not being served by the Opposition who are tabling Opposition day debates, falsely dividing the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/4">If the Opposition were to put their efforts into working closely with the two parties that form this coalition to come to a sensible solution, I believe that measures would be in the White Paper, but we are still seeing sledging and negative comments from Opposition Front-Bench Members as we have seen all day. It is deeply disappointing that the Opposition are so thoroughly letting down the people whom they claim they represent. I do not believe it is too late, and I really urge them to get back to the table and to be more positive about the steps that the Government are taking&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Here we go again; I cannot even finish a sentence without Opposition Members chuntering.</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/5">The fact is that I worked very closely with a number of Opposition colleagues. Various Members have talked about the very good work we did in the inquiry led by the all-party group on local government that looked at this issue. There was an all-party agreed proposal that identified many measures&#8212;which the Government have picked up in the draft White Paper&#8212;that we can achieve together. The effort should be focused on what we agree on, so that we can offer the reassurance that is needed by the desperately worried people all around the country that have been quietly identified this evening. People are worried not only about the social care system now, but the social care system in the future. We should be reassuring these people and giving them hope that this House has the necessary combined will and determination. I do not think any of us want to face the electorate at the next general election saying that this problem has not been solved.</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/6">As to the timetable, yes, I would love to be able to stand here today and congratulate the Government on finding every penny to fund a long-term solution. If we can get the cross-party talks into gear in September, we should be able to put in place the mechanism that, as confirmed by the Secretary of State, could be built into a Bill and put before Parliament. When all parties have agreed on how this is to be funded&#8212;as many people have rightly said, it will cost billions of pounds every year and we are in a very difficult financial situation, so</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/7">all parties must agree on how those billions can be found&#8212;there is every possibility that such a Bill will get through Parliament and, when next year&#8217;s comprehensive spending review is developed, the money will be found.</p>
	<p pid="d.776.1/8">Yes, it is frustrating if we have to wait another year or 18 months. Before I entered the House, I spent the best part of my adult life working for Age Concern England and for the International Longevity Centre in the UK, coming up with solutions that previous Governments certainly kicked into the long grass, so this is our best hope in a generation.</p>

	<p pid="d.778.0/1">I respect the hon. Lady&#8217;s work on this issue, but does she recognise that there is almost universal agreement outside the House that the big disappointment is that there were no proposals last week on how, in the longer term, we provide the funds that we all want for care for the elderly and those with disabilities?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.778.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" speakername="Sarah Newton" colnum="778"  time="021:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#12071633000294">
	<p pid="d.778.1/1">I accept that there is genuine disappointment, but people equally understand that all parties in the House must be committed on where the billions of pounds each year will come from, so that the proposals are sustainable for the long term, and so that people can save and invest without fear of the rug being pulled from beneath them.</p>
	<p pid="d.778.1/2">The proposals are a sticking plaster&#8212;there is not doubt about that&#8212;but if only people could hear the facts, they would appreciate that more money is being put into the system while the problem is being resolved for the long term. It is not true that all councils are cutting back. Cornwall council has not cut its adult social care. It is working in extremely innovative ways with the NHS and the voluntary sector to ensure that services are improved. I do not accept the shroud waving from Opposition Members, who say that every part of the country is in crisis.</p>

	<p pid="d.778.2/1">My hon. Friend has a high interest in, and knowledge of, these matters. Does she agree that counties such as hers and mine&#8212;Cornwall and Gloucestershire&#8212;that prioritise adult social services precisely because of their ageing populations, are helping to find a solution to the problem, which is so badly needed by constituents all round the country?</p>

	<p pid="d.778.3/1">I agree. I encourage people to read the good report published today by the all-party parliamentary group on local government, because it contains good examples from all over the country of how proper integration of social services with housing and the NHS is beginning. There is every possibility, as a result of HealthWatch and the health and wellbeing boards, that such integration innovation will deliver the joined-up services for families and carers that will lead to an agenda focused on public health and the prevention of the problems that lead people into acute settings such as A and E and hospitals. People currently end up in such settings far more than they need to.</p>
	<p pid="d.778.3/2">I am confident that, in a years&#8217; time, hon. Members on both sides of the House will come here to share best practice from those parts of the country that grasp the opportunities of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and make the most of the changes. We can then encourage other parts of the country that do not prioritise those</p>
	<p pid="d.778.3/3">matters to do the best they can for older people and carers in their societies. All hon. Members want them to have higher-quality and better care so that they can live in dignity for the rest of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="d.779.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> was kind enough to say that people of a pensionable age can sometimes make useful contributions. He is very kind to me&#8212;I am the only Member of a pensionable age to speak in the debate. I am 37 in my mind, but with a son of 42, that is rather unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/2">The Government have failed at the core of the White Paper, on the question of funding. This is about money, not leadership or consensus or making nice words in the Chamber. I am very pleased that Labour Front Benchers have accepted Dilnot. His proposals are not perfect, but he goes a long way to proposing a free national care service, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase> and I want.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/3">I know Andrew Dilnot well&#8212;he is a fine, highly intelligent and compassionate man. He went to great lengths to tailor a precise scheme that could be accepted by the Government, but at the last minute, they have buckled and not committed to it. The problem is the Treasury&#8212;the worst Government Department of all. It has failed the country over and over again with terrible mistakes. The European exchange rate mechanism destroyed the credibility of the Conservatives, but the Treasury has done lots of other bad things. It is a dreadful Department. I hope that Ministers now tell me how wonderful it is.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/4">There has been almost no mention of the royal commission on long-term care from some 14 years ago&#8212;I think my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon mentioned it&#8212;which recommended free long-term care, which is precisely what he and I want. However, the Government at the time&#8212;they happened to be a Government I supported&#8212;could see that the report was going to be unanimous, so they slotted in two people at the last minute to ensure that it was not unanimous, and from that point onwards they hung on to the minority report of those two members. It was a bit of a disgrace, and I made that point strongly. I tabled an early-day motion in the 1997 to 2001 Parliament calling for implementation of the royal commission&#8217;s recommendations, which was signed by more than 100 Members of the House at that time, and in the 2001 to 2005 Parliament I tabled another early-day motion saying the same thing, again with the same sort of support. I also have the support of the National Pensioners Convention&#8212;a body with which I am closely associated&#8212;which also wants free long-care on the same basis as in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/5">In Scandinavia they do it. Indeed, what I have always wanted my party to do&#8212;as well as the others, but particularly mine&#8212;is to move in the direction of Scandinavia, not the United States of America. If Members read the book &#8220;The Spirit Level&#8221;, they can see that the civilised societies&#8212;where people are happier and all sorts of social problems are lesser&#8212;are in the Scandinavian- style countries. The worst end of the spectrum is in America, and we have been steadily moving towards the American end, not the Scandinavian end.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/6">In the end it is about cost and this word &#8220;affordability&#8221;. We choose what is affordable. It is not written in stone: we can choose to make things affordable, and we can</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/7">choose to pay for them by progressive taxation&#8212;if we wish. It is a political choice. People say, &#8220;Oh, well it&#8217;s not affordable.&#8221; However&#8212;I have told this story many times&#8212;I remember that when my children were young, if they asked for a second ice cream, my wife would say to them, &#8220;Mummy can&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; when what she was really saying was: &#8220;You can&#8217;t have another ice cream.&#8221; Of course she could afford it. We can afford to pay for free long-term care too, but we choose not to&#8212;so far. I hope to persuade my side at least to commit to it in time.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/8">The extra costs of Dilnot would initially be &#163;2 billion a year. That is the equivalent of 0.5p on the standard rate of income tax. I have put this to many people in meetings and asked them, &#8220;What would you choose: the threat that your home would be taken away, with no equity to hand on to your grandchildren, or an extra 0.5p on the standard rate?&#8221; Without exception, they say 0.5p on the standard rate. Of course, we do not have to do it that way, because there is plenty of cash in the tax gap, which is estimated to be as much as &#163;120 billion a year, or even more. If we collected a tiny fraction of that&#8212;one sixtieth&#8212;we could cover Dilnot&#8217;s proposals; and, if we have to have a bit more, let us squeeze the tax gap a bit further. However, since Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s time as Prime Minister, we have seen the standard rate cut by 5p, which is 10 times more than the cost of Dilnot, so do not let us pretend that it not affordable. We choose not pay for it, because we think&#8212;or some people think&#8212;that low taxes are better or that letting tax evaders and tax avoiders get away with it is better than looking after elderly people in great need.</p>
	<p pid="d.779.0/9">We are also committed, apparently&#8212;I understand that this goes for both sides of the House&#8212;to the idea of owner occupation, but we are actually seeing the gradual erosion of owner occupation, particularly by poorer people having their houses taken away when&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.780.1/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>. I commend him for his ability to get Europe into almost every debate we have in this House. I am not sure whether his sums quite added up at the end of his speech, but it is commendable that we have seen a commitment across the House this evening to improving the dignity and quality of elderly care, which is something I am sure we would all like to see.</p>
	<p pid="d.780.1/2">All previous Governments have taken steps in that direction, but I believe that the White Paper and the draft Bill that this Government have brought forward represent the most significant steps towards improving dignity in elderly care for a generation. The in-principle support for Dilnot and the Dilnot proposals is a good recommendation, and it needs to be considered in the context of whole-government spending at the next spending review. However, for the first time there has been an in-principle agreement by a Government that social care is one of the most important issues and challenges facing our country. How we are going to provide dignity in elderly care&#8212;high-quality care in the community&#8212;is a clear priority for this Government, and that should be commended.</p>
	<p pid="d.780.1/3">I want to outline some of the real challenges that face people who are in receipt of social care, particularly the frail elderly. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase> pointed out that it can be difficult to distinguish between NHS care and social care, because they often involve exactly the same things. They include supporting the activities of daily life that we all take for granted, such as washing, dressing, getting in and out of bed or the bath and going up and down stairs. Those are the kinds of things that we mean when we talk about providing high-quality social care, and this Government have put forward strong measures that will make it much easier to provide such care for the people who most need it.</p>
	<p pid="d.780.1/4">The White Paper and the draft Bill provide for support for carers, and for improving the personalisation of care, which is particularly important for younger people in receipt of social care, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> said. Respite care is also recognised as an important means of better supporting carers, giving them a break from the hard work of looking after people and ensuring that the role of carers is properly supported. The proposals also include a commitment to portability of care, and to a universal care assessment.</p>

	<p pid="d.781.0/1">I raised the issue of portability with the Secretary of State last week. It is crucial that a debate should take place about what we are doing here and what is happening in Wales, as this is a devolved matter. There must be close liaison between us. I understand that the initiative must come from the Welsh Government but, without that liaison, people will fall between the two countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.781.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. Social care and NHS care do not recognise county borders, which is why portability is so important. They certainly do not recognise the boundaries between England and Wales or between any other parts of the United Kingdom. We have devolved responsibility for the NHS, and the fact that there are different funding priorities in the different parts of the UK, with the Government in England supporting investment in the NHS and the Labour Administration in Wales cutting NHS spending, highlights the importance of my hon. Friend&#8217;s point. I am sure that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the coalition Government are taking steps to ensure that portability can take place across those borders wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.781.1/2">The White Paper also contains a commendable commitment to improving integrated care and ensuring that more joined-up working takes place between the NHS and social care.</p>

	<p pid="d.781.2/1">Would my hon. Friend like to comment on some of the Opposition&#8217;s assertions that the efficiency savings from reductions in management levels in NHS are not being put back into front-line services to enable integration, and that they are somehow being siphoned off to the Treasury? I do not believe that&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.782.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40156" speakername="Daniel Poulter" colnum="782"  time="021:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172000699">
	<p pid="d.782.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention, and I agree with her. The Government are making a clear commitment to encouraging integrated care and to putting savings made in the back office back into the front line of NHS care. Many billions of pounds have already been committed, and there is more money in the draft Bill to encourage better integration between the NHS and social care services.</p>
	<p pid="d.782.0/2">As the Minister of State said, it is important to shift the emphasis away from crisis management and towards preventive care. The focus on housing as part of the integrated care system is important. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase> made the point that, far too often, older people fall over and injure themselves as a result of poor lighting or a lack of handrails in their homes, ending up in the accident and emergency department, when better lighting and preventive care in the home would have provided a much more effective way of looking after them properly, as well as saving the NHS and social care a lot of money. That key commitment to more integration between the NHS, providers of housing and social services providers is a fundamental ingredient of the way in which we can improve the day-to-day quality of adult social care, while also saving a great deal of money, which can be spent on improving care for everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="d.782.0/3">Finally, let me talk a little about funding. The Dilnot proposals have been agreed to in principle, and I hope that the Opposition will at least give the Government some credit for the fact that there has been a once-in-a-generation attempt to deal with this issue. It is not good enough to say, 13 years into an Administration, &#8220;Three weeks before the general election, we will publish a White Paper.&#8221; No one could consider that a serious commitment to tackling the challenges that we face.</p>
	<p pid="d.782.0/4">The way forward now must be the cross-party working that we all believe is desirable. That means that all parties must work together and support the Government&#8217;s White Paper, support day-to-day improvements in care for older people, and support the agreement in principle to the Dilnot proposals that the Government have presented.</p>

	<p pid="d.782.1/1">While we sit here discussing this issue, families will be sitting in their living rooms or around hospital beds trying to decide what to do for their loved ones. Can they stay in their own homes? Will someone be able to deliver 24-hour care? How long will the situation continue? What will happen when the money runs out? What should they do for the best? While we sit here listening to the Minister telling us that we will sort things out in the future, families&#8212;now&#8212;are making the most difficult decisions of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="d.782.1/2">I want to talk about the reality for my constituents, and to plead with the Minister to work with all the political parties in this place to find a long-term solution to the growing crisis of adult social care. It has to be a long-term solution: it has to be a solution that will last for many years, whoever is in government, and we have to find it now, not after the next general election. Old age happens only once to each individual. It is not something that we can return to and do better next time.</p>
	<p pid="d.782.1/3">We cannot just look at residential care; we must also look at the systems that keep people in their own homes, and allow them to lead fulfilling lives and live in dignity. The present situation is dire. Bolton council has had to cut &#163;15 million from its budget for adult social care, which means that it can no longer give support to the 536 people aged between 18 and 64 and to the 1,312 people aged over 65 who have moderate needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.783.0/1">Does my hon.

	<p pid="d.783.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it simply is not good enough to express&#8212;as the White Paper does&#8212;concerns about such matters as short periods of care time, or the fact that some carers are not even earning the minimum wage, if there is no way of making things work financially? I do not believe that councils have chosen 15-minute slots deliberately; I believe that they have done it in order to save costs and make efficiencies. Similarly, there are carers who have to pay for their own travel.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.783.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" speakername="Julie Hilling" colnum="783"  time="021:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172000704">
	<p pid="d.783.3/1">We have to realise that we are facing a crisis now, not a crisis in the future. People in our constituencies are suffering daily. A young man in my constituency who has learning difficulties and has relied on carers to help him with his everyday life will now see his carer only once a week. Contact with a carer is the only contact that many such people ever have with another human being, and that contact is now going. It is truly a false economy. This low level of care for people with moderate needs is what keeps them in their homes, keeps them healthy, and stops them ending up in residential care prematurely. Bolton is managing to maintain substantial and critical care, but it will have to find &#163;34 million in cuts over the next two years, and it is worried that it will have to join other councils in only providing critical care.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/2">Paying for home care is a huge worry. The average cost is &#163;13.61 an hour, but it can be a great deal more; in Brighton and Hove, carers cost &#163;21.50. It is not unusual for people paying for care to have to find more than &#163;10,000 a year to cover that cost. That spending needs to be taken into account if we are to have caps over the whole amount. Many Members will know that my mother has been in and out of care over the past 12 months. We have spent &#163;20,000 since October on her care.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/3">The cuts to local authority budgets are affecting other support services, and the consequent cuts to the voluntary sector are having dire consequences. The voluntary sector provides luncheon clubs, social activities and carers groups, all of which are under pressure or at risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/4">Horwich visiting service in my constituency has lost funding and can no longer employ its part-time co-ordinator. That was the person who recruited volunteers,</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/5">sorted out the police clearance, provided training, ascertained the needs of clients and supported the volunteers. The volunteers will continue to visit the elderly and disabled people with whom they are currently in contact, but it will not be possible to recruit new volunteers or take on new clients.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/6">The fees local authorities pay to care homes is also an issue. There has been a significant real-terms cut over the last two years. That inevitably impacts on care. It also means self-funders are charged more in order to subsidise the costs of council-funded residents.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/7">The choice of home is another huge concern. The other day, I was speaking to one of the police officers on the parliamentary estate. He told me his mother was in a care home. He and the family had chosen a home that suited her needs and they had sold her house to pay for the care, but now the money is running out and he does not know whether the local authority will pay the care home fees, whether his mum will have to move or whether the family will somehow have to pay the additional costs. If the cap is ever introduced, that will be too late for him, but he still needs to know that the care costs will be met in future.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/8">The needs of the elderly and disabled do not move in a straight line. Some people may need to go into care for a period of time, such as when recovering from an illness or an accident, but, with support, be able to return home. However, we were told that after six months my mum would have to sell her flat to pay for her care. In fact, after eight months in a care home, she has returned to her own flat. That shows that people do not move in a straight line through the system. Decisions should not be taken on the basis of cost alone; they should be taken on the basis of needs, too.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/9">Let me conclude by reading out a comment from a constituent of mine called Amy:</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/10">&#8220;Alongside the funding crisis there is also a huge injustice in the way we pay for care. This includes the dementia tax, where tens of thousands of families are left to pay all their care costs whilst other terminal conditions are paid for by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/11">The significant cost of care means many carers face financial hardship and are often forced to give up work.</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/12">We need reform to build a fair and sustainable care system which delivers dignity, independence and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.783.3/13">Amy is right. We need to get on with this. We need to find a solution where people&#8217;s needs are taken into account, and where people do not live in fear for both themselves and their families. We need to find a solution to this problem that all of us can live with, and that cares for people who are in need in our society.</p>

	<p pid="d.784.2/1">I shall be very brief then, Mr Speaker. I have just two minutes.</p>
	<p pid="d.784.2/2">When we talk about social care, we tend to spend most of our time discussing the elderly. I want to say a few words about young disabled people, however, who</p>
	<p pid="d.784.2/3">benefit from social care, and who need to have a voice in this debate. I chair the all-party group on young disabled people, and we have been discussing many of the key issues. Last week, we discussed housing, for example. I welcome the money proposed in the White Paper for improving housing for the disabled, but may I sound a note of caution? At present, too many wheelchair-adapted houses are not going to those who need them&#8212;people in wheelchairs. It is all very well constructing these houses, but we must get the allocation policy right, too.</p>
	<p pid="d.784.2/4">I welcome the transition funding, but I have a plea to make on that. There is a concern that there is a cliff-edge at the age of 18. For many families it is, as it were, a gradual cliff-edge. Things start to decline at 14, so the care package they get at 18 might not be the appropriate one they need as an adult. May I ask the Minister to look at that issue closely?</p>
	<p pid="d.784.2/5">I welcome the introduction of portability, as that is crucial. I know that the Opposition brought similar measures in when in government, but we are taking this further. It is far more important for younger disabled people than it is for those who are elderly. We talk a lot in this Chamber about social mobility. One of the main hurdles for young disabled people who wish to go to university is the great fear that when they get there they will not have the same social care package as they had when they were at home with their parents. That is the main fear they face; it is what keeps them at home and means that they do not take full advantage of the educational opportunities on offer. I will stop there.</p>

	<p pid="d.785.0/1">No family in the land is untouched by the challenges of social care. Families up and down the land who will watch this debate or read about it know that if social care is not an issue for them today, it may be an issue for them later. Labour Members therefore think it is important that it is spoken about not in policy wonk or accountancy terminology, but in terms of people. That is because it is an issue about people, be they the elderly, the disabled, the young disabled, about whom we heard eloquently just now, the carers within the family or the tens of thousands of men and women who work as professional care workers, about whom my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase> talked so eloquently earlier.</p>
	<p pid="d.785.0/2">Let me say from the outset that the Opposition accept that this is an issue about which we could have done more. Social care and the challenges it poses in the 21st century are unfinished business for Labour. However, it is not true to say, as some Government Members have unfortunately done, that Labour was wholly inactive on the issue of social care. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> about all the steps we took and the innovations we made on issues associated with social care. To say that we were totally inactive is quite wrong and is merely party political point scoring, but it is true that we did not grasp sufficiently early the political nettle of how social care is to be paid for. That is why, from the very beginning, we offered talks and entered willingly into them, and why we remain willing to resume talks, so long as Ministers are acting in good faith.</p>
	<p pid="d.785.0/3">Social care is an issue for families up and down the land. Government Members have said that people have to understand that they are going to sell off their homes, but the point about that is that homes are not mere bricks and mortar. These may be the homes that people came to as a young married couple and where they brought up their children; these are homes freighted with memory, emotion and family life. It is too easy to say that people have to be ready to sell off their homes. This is about people; it is not just about figures on a piece of paper.</p>
	<p pid="d.785.0/4">Social care is also quintessentially an issue for the squeezed middle, to use the phrase of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" name="Edward Miliband">the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>. The very poor will not have to meet their own costs, although there are still issues to address about standards of care, and the cost of care is not a problem for the extremely wealthy. This is an issue for the squeezed middle; it is an issue for people who, perhaps through years of struggle, have a home and assets and now see the frightening possibility&#8212;this is particularly the case for the elderly&#8212;of those assets being drained away because of a system that is not yet under control.</p>

	<p pid="d.786.1/1">I am afraid that I will not be able to give way, because I want to leave sufficient time for the Minister to make her remarks.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/2">We also have to address the issues of dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s. They are largely dealt with as social care issues but in fact they are an increasing challenge for people as they grow older.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/3">The Minister called social care Bevan&#8217;s orphan and I think that that is a little unfair. The world we face today is very different from the world of William Beveridge and the framers of the first national health service. People live much longer and do so with all sorts of long-term conditions, whereas changes in the role of women mean that there is no longer a vast, mute and hidden army of carers. There are also issues with dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/4">The Opposition want to be collaborative rather than party political, but I would be failing in my responsibilities if I did not draw to the attention of Ministers the one message given to my colleagues and I as we have gone up and down the country talking to local authorities about the new public health arrangements and social care. Those in town halls, whether they are Labour or Conservative-led, have said that local authorities are under unprecedented financial pressure. Some of the things we heard from Ministers seemed to suggest a certain carelessness about or unwillingness to face up to the financial pressures that mean that local authorities are making real decisions that are affecting real people and real families. Ministers heard what local authorities are trying to do to make the money stretch. On the one hand, there are more stringent criteria, so people need to be in greater need to get social care at all, but on the other hand, they are squeezing the money and the standards. That is the only way it can happen.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/5">If I could say only one thing to Ministers, it would be that they should listen not to the Opposition spokespeople or to Labour councillors but to their own Conservative councillors, who are trying to make them address the</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/6">scale of the crisis that they face. They are very alarmed&#8212;we know that they are&#8212;that Ministers appear to be poised to place additional responsibilities on them without any ideas of how to provide funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/7">I remember what the Prime Minister told this House in February 2010, speaking about social care. He said:</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/8">&#8220;What we want to know is: where is the money coming from?&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-02-10.904"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 February 2010; Vol. 505, c. 904</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/9">I have to say that councillors and families up and down the country, as well as Members of this House, want to know what is behind the fine words and what Ministers will do to fund the proposals outlined in their White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/10">Precisely because I do not want to be party political, I will refrain from talking about the Conservative party&#8217;s party political broadcast on the death tax and the posters that said:</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/11">&#8220;Now Gordon wants &#163;20,000 when you die. Don&#8217;t vote for Labour&#8217;s new death tax.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/12">I am not a party political person, so I shall leave that. I shall put it to one side.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/13">We support Dilnot in principle, but we are a little concerned about the Secretary of State&#8217;s pick-and-mix approach to the recommendations. We are worried that although the White Paper reads well, it makes too many vague commitments. I would be grateful if the Minister could give me an answer on the question of loans, in particular. On that question, as she will be aware, the 1999 royal commission&#8212;sadly, we did not address the issues of funding that it raised&#8212;said that</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/14">&#8220;there would need to be an initial outlay of potentially between &#163;1bn and &#163;2.8bn&#8230;the scheme would be complex to establish, and to administer, probably very expensive initially and would leave the state with an uncertain liability. If Local Authorities administered it, they might be left with a complex burden of assets which would differ greatly from one part of the country to another. The Commission consider there little overall benefit to be gained from such a scheme.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/15">I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me &#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It is a deferred payment scheme at the discretion of local authorities&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> We want to know how the Government will fund the upfront costs and about the levels of interest. Members will appreciate that elderly people, in particular, are very concerned about issues of debt. On that and on a range of other issues, we are waiting for a little more detail from Ministers. They can sit on the Front Bench and make party political remarks, but that is no help to families throughout the country who are worried about how they can fund social care in the future. It is no help to local authorities, which say that in a very few years the cost of social care will have inflated so much that they will not be able to meet other needs from their budget.</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/16">There are many things in the White Paper that we welcome, not least because many of them were in the White Paper introduced by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> on building a national care service. We say to Ministers that it is easy to score points. It is easy to talk about what could have been done in the past, but we need to meet the challenge of how we care for our elderly, our disabled and our young disabled. That is the challenge that the nation is facing now. The White Paper reads well, but Age Concern and all the stake-holders are asking how Ministers will</p>
	<p pid="d.786.1/17">fund it. We stand ready to enter talks. We stand ready to work with Ministers. All we ask from Ministers is that they act in good faith.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.788.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40288" speakername="Anne Milton" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="788"  time="021:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172000711">
	<p pid="d.788.0/1">I was heartened by some of what I read in the motion tabled by the Opposition. Welcoming the measures laid out in the care and support White Paper was a good start to a process that will be immensely easier with genuine co-operation and communication. However, the speeches from the Opposition Front Bench were partisan and contained no acknowledgement that for 13 years they did nothing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">The hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> seems to have amnesia. Cheap party political squabbling is not attractive. I remind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> that she was very political by trying not to be political. I remind her also that 40,000 people a year had to sell their homes to pay for their care. It reflects badly on her and on the House and does nothing to improve the lives of service users, carers and staff. A White Paper seven days before the general election announcement counts for little.</p>
	<p pid="d.788.0/2">Care has to be funded in a way that is fair on service users and fair on the taxpayer. We agree with Dilnot that financial protection through capped costs and an extended means test are the right basis for any new funding system. Given the extra public spending that will be involved, we need to consider that alongside other priorities. An issue that has been raised throughout the debate is the funding for the means-tested system. The right place&#8212;the responsible place&#8212;to consider that is in the course of the spending review and I do not intend to pre-empt that tonight. I draw hon. Members&#8217; attention to the progress report. Many of the answers to the questions that they raise are included in that. The hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington would do well to refer to figure 4 in the report.</p>
	<p pid="d.788.0/3">We have allocated an extra &#163;7.2 billion to improve care and support as part of the spending review. That comes as part of what we know is a tough settlement for local government. If spent well, it will go far and will help local authorities maintain people&#8217;s access to care and support. The recent report from Demos and Scope shows that this can be done, and that reduced funding does not have to mean a reduced service. By putting more into reablement services that help people regain their independence, for example, or by supporting people to live in the community instead of in expensive residential care, local authorities can provide the best standards of care while saving money.</p>
	<p pid="d.788.0/4">My hon. Friend the Minister of State mentioned the &#163;32.5 million for better online services and traditional communication methods to help people see what services are available, whether their care is paid for by them or by the state. Likewise, there is an additional &#163;200 million for specialised housing. That additional money more than pays for the White Paper proposals leading up to the comprehensive spending review. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40156" name="Daniel Poulter">the Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter)</phrase> said, the issue was ducked repeatedly by the previous Government in far more favourable economic times. He also drew attention to the absurd distinctions between health and social care and the need for integration.</p>
	<p pid="d.788.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase> spoke from the heart about the needs of carers, the &#163;400 million we have provided for carers&#8217; breaks and the end of permanent billing. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> spoke of the contribution older people make and how to stop the fit becoming frail. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> reiterated the ADASS figures and the desire for people to stay in their own homes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase> spoke with passion and knowledge of the unity and commonality of purpose we need and the divisive nature of the Opposition&#8217;s motion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40092" name="Paul Maynard">the Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)</phrase> pointed out the huge need to address the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.788.0/6">These are ambitious plans. As well as setting out a comprehensive package of reform for the longer term, the White Paper announces changes that will make a difference immediately: a national eligibility threshold; proper and meaningful portability; duties to share information to ensure that people can move without losing their care; a focus on housing; provider quality profiles so that people can finally have clear information on the quality of care providers; mandatory adult safeguarding boards; and a requirement to assess carers&#8217; needs and actually meet them&#8212;much neglected help and support. It also announces a code of conduct and minimum training standards for care workers so that people know that their care is underpinned by high standards of training and ethics. We will train more care workers, with 50,000 more apprenticeships by 2017, double the current number.</p>

	<p pid="d.789.1/1">The hon. Gentleman should welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="d.789.1/2">The White Paper opens for business the new national information website so that people can find out more about all parts of the care and support system. It sets out legal entitlements to personal budgets so that care users, their families and their carers can choose what services they get. There are improvements to the transition to children&#8217;s services to adult services. These are big changes, egalitarian changes and, most of all, they will be effective changes. We are also reforming the existing social care legislation through the draft Care and Support Bill. The White Paper is about keeping people well and helping them to take control, get independent and live the lives they deserve with the certainty and security they need to do so with dignity.</p>
	<p pid="d.789.1/3">There are times when we, as politicians, need not only to open our eyes and ears to the world outside this House, but to stand in the shoes of those we represent. They do not want to see us argue, squabble and bicker over their lives. On this issue, perhaps more than any other, we need to work together. If we do that, we can improve the system for millions of people, whether they use the services or care for someone who uses them. The system is funded until the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="d.789.1/4">I urge Opposition Members and Front Benchers to put aside party political differences and work alongside us to ensure that we have a system that is sustainable</p>
	<p pid="d.789.1/5">not only for this year and next, until the next general election, but for the years ahead. Older people in this country, the carers who support them and people with disabilities deserve that. The White Paper gives us a foundation on which to work, a foundation that has been missing for far too long. In 13 years in government, in favourable economic times, those now on the Opposition Benches did nothing that was sustainable in the long term. We need a foundation that gives us a chance to build a care and support system that future generations will be proud of. I urge the House to reject the motion.</p>

	<p pid="d.795.1/33">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the House debated professional standards in the banking industry for a full day and resolved to establish a Joint Committee of the two Houses on that matter. As I said in that debate, I do not think there is any disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on what we need to do, which is to sustain in the UK a strong, vibrant, transparent and more accountable financial sector that commands international confidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.795.1/34">The motion before us is the result of negotiation following the House&#8217;s decision to establish a Joint Committee. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> for the work that he has undertaken while also chairing a very active Select Committee. I also thank Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition. Following the debate, it was essential that Parliament was seen to be acting in the best interests of the public in resolving the issue before it, and that could happen only if the Joint Committee were supported not only by the parties in Government but by the Opposition. I am grateful to those who have added their signatures to the motion.</p>
	<p pid="d.795.1/35">I do not intend to detain the House for long. I want to make five points, spending half a minute on each. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="d.796.0/1">Order. Before the Leader of the House makes his five points, to which I wish to listen carefully, may I gently say to the House that he should be heard? Any Member should be heard, but the Leader of the House is a very senior Member, and Members should not be sitting chuntering to each other; they should show him some courtesy, which they all learnt at one time.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.796.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40452" speakername="George Young" colnum="796"  time="022:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172001237">
	<p pid="d.796.1/1">As I said, I have five points and will spend half a minute on each one.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/2">First, the process to establish the Commission is not following the normal process for establishing a Joint Committee. The Commission, if established tonight, will be able to begin its work immediately and to meet during the recess. It is my hope that before the other place rises, it will also establish a Committee of an equal number of members to act jointly with the Commission that we are establishing tonight.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/3">Secondly, the Commission is being established with powers that are already inherent in our parliamentary system. It will also have the novel power to invite special advisers, including counsel appointed by the Commission, to examine witnesses. I do not think that that will become the modus operandi of other Select Committees, but it will give the Commission the teeth that it needs to carry out its important investigative role quickly and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/4">Thirdly, it is proposed that</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/5">&#8220;the Commission shall have power to appoint sub-committees to consider matters specified by the Commission&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/6">Unusually, the sub-committees will have a quorum of one. I have discussed that with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. The purpose is to allow a single member of the Commission to consider a specific issue, for example a technical matter, and to send for papers with a view to informing the wider Commission. That will feed into the Commission&#8217;s work and allow it to tackle a broad-ranging subject in a compressed time frame.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/7">Fourthly, paragraph (13) of the motion directs the House of Commons Commission to assess the costs arising from the Parliamentary Commission to be paid by the Government. As the Chancellor said in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-05">5 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/8">&#8220;I commit to giving it any resources it needs to do its job.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-05.1136"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 July 2012; Vol. 547, c. 1136</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/9">I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase>, who sought reassurance during our debate on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-05">5 July</phrase> that the Commission should not raid</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/10">&#8220;the staff and resources of other Committees.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-07-05.1149"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 July 2012; Vol. 547, c. 1149</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/11">Fifthly and finally, the motion sets a deadline for a report on legislative action of <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-18">18 December</phrase>. That will include pre-legislative scrutiny of the banking reform Bill and any recommendations of the Commission&#8217;s inquiry that require a legislative vehicle in order to be implemented. The December deadline will give the Government time to consider any recommendations in time for the introduction of the banking reform Bill, which is planned for January 2013. If the Commission cannot complete all its work by <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-18">18 December</phrase>, we will expect it to report on the other areas as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="d.796.1/12">We have in this Parliament the skills, expertise and mandate to do the job. I am confident in the ability of the new Commission to rise to the challenges that confront us and to address the central issue at stake: restoring confidence in the UK banking industry. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.797.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="797"  time="022:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172001238">
	<p pid="d.797.0/1">Like the Leader of the House, I do not wish to repeat the debate that we had on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-05">5 July</phrase>. We are in slightly calmer waters, we hope. In that debate, all parties on this side of the House felt that we needed a judge-led inquiry into the LIBOR scandal and wider issues in the banking industry. We did not win the vote so, despite our reservations, we decided to co-operate with the inquiry led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>. I am grateful to the Leader of the House for his admission that the success of the Commission relies on the Opposition&#8217;s support. That gets us off on a better foot than might have been the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.797.0/2">There are some novel elements to the motion, as the Leader of the House pointed out, not least the sub-committees of one. We will look with interest to see how that works in a Commission of the size that is proposed, especially given that it is a joint Commission with the other place.</p>
	<p pid="d.797.0/3">I am particularly pleased with the assurances that the resources that are needed will not be taken out of House of Commons resources for other Select Committees. I wonder whether the Leader of the House has a view on what amount of resources might be used and whether we will be kept informed as the process goes on. The Opposition are keen that the ongoing work of the Treasury Committee, the primary job of which is to hold the Government to account, must not be badly affected by its members, not least its Chairman, being engaged in other important work, which may have a tendency to take them away from their day job. We will obviously keep a keen eye on the situation, to ensure that the Treasury Committee&#8217;s work of holding the Government to account does not suffer as a result of the other duties that the hon. Member for Chichester and other members of the Committee who are to sit on the Commission will take on.</p>
	<p pid="d.797.0/4">Having emphasised once again our belief that we needed a judge-led inquiry, the Opposition are happy, given that the vote on that was lost, to co-operate with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s inquiry, and we will watch its progress with interest. If the House divides this evening, we will join the Leader of the House in the Lobby.</p>

	<p pid="d.798.0/1">I rise briefly to welcome the motion and wish all the members of the Commission the best. I recognise the willingness that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> has expressed for the Commission&#8217;s work to be forward-looking, and I understand that its role will not be to act as prosecutor. However, I give its members this piece of advice. They are doing the people&#8217;s work, and the people have an expectation of the review of the financial crisis and the financial services sector. They will not understand the work of the Commission unless this is accomplished: somebody has to go to jail.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.0/2">Criminal prosecutions are an essential part of cleansing our financial services sector and moving us forward, to ensure that the City can reassert itself and its reputation not only in the eyes of the world but in the eyes of the British people. That is one of the most important requirements of the parliamentary inquiry, and I leave it to the Commission to consider that comment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-16d.798.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" speakername="John Mann" colnum="798"  time="022:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120716/debtext/120716-0004.htm#1207172001240">
	<p pid="d.798.1/1">It appears that this Commission, which was originally described as a very narrow one, is broadening so that, as the Leader of the House said, it can now look at particular matters with sub-committees of one, and there are suggestions that it should broaden into criminal prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/2">The issues remain as they were, but the evidence is changing and will continue to change. That is the problem with setting up ad hoc committees. Just in the past hour, further e-mails have come from the Bank of England that have some significance for matters that have already been looked at, looked at again and looked at a third time. Those e-mails are significant to what the Treasury Committee looked at the first time, and doubtless information will continue to emerge.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/3">This is a moving feast, and the problem with a moving feast is that setting a time limit when one does not know what will happen next can lead to a certain momentum, which can be in the wrong direction. The</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/4">problem is not that it is an arbitrary time limit&#8212;any time limit is arbitrary&#8212;but that it could be an irrational one.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/5">Tomorrow in the United States, a new court action is being initiated not on LIBOR but on other market manipulation by banks, and specifically a British bank. We will see what happens as that court action proceeds, but simply examining LIBOR, and especially only the one bank in which what has gone on has been partially exposed, rather misses the point about market manipulation by investment banks over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/6">Even within the context of LIBOR, we have only just reached the stage of seeing some of the market manipulation that happened, and only in one bank, Barclays, which has received bad publicity. There is far more to be revealed about that, and I am certain that there will be more surprises to come in the next day, week or two weeks. Those surprises may well continue to flow.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/7">Even in the case of Barclays, the manipulation of LIBOR is one tiny part of the allegations of market manipulation and anti-competitive work. A swathe of evidence is beginning to emerge, and more people are now prepared to speak out about how a range of markets have been manipulated in a range of ways. Derivatives have been used as the basis of that manipulation, but in fact it is much more complex than that. At its heart, as Barclays has said, was the making of a quick profit. In the past two weeks, courts in Canada have specified in a non-LIBOR-related case where the judge has pronounced that it was manipulation for short-term profit on an anti-competitive basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.798.1/8">That is just one bank. No one can answer&#8212;the question was not answered by the Financial Services Authority today; perhaps it is not in its remit to do so&#8212;what the contingent liability is for Barclays. That is a small concern, and of significance to people working for the bank, people who have shares in it, and the wider economy, but it is clear that the largely state-owned banks, not least the Royal Bank of Scotland but also Lloyds TSB, have been doing the same thing. The problem that we will face is not just the issues of criminality that may or may not emerge. Proving a criminal case in any of that is fiendishly difficult&#8212;both finding the person who has committed an act and finding a victim so that a case can be taken. If law suits, beginning in the United States but spreading elsewhere, start to succeed, the amounts of money that have been fiddled are so great&#8212;because of the instruments that were used&#8212;that the British taxpayer may face a huge, unquantified bill, and we do not know when it will arrive. The future of Barclays is somewhat in question.</p>

	<p pid="d.799.0/1">Order. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is indulging in scene setting&#8212;offering the House the context&#8212;but I would politely suggest that he will wish to turn to the proceedings and composition of the intended Committee. If it is helpful to him, I gently remind him, in relation to the motion, that he has 15 paragraphs from which to choose when deciding how to focus his remarks.</p>

	<p pid="d.799.1/1">I thank you for your guidance, Mr Speaker. My initial remarks related to the remit of the Committee, rather than its composition, which is frankly an irrelevance compared with the problems of the moving feast of its remit.</p>
	<p pid="d.799.1/2">The remit has been set so vaguely that it can incorporate anything and everything. We will face the economic consequences when the partially state-owned banks are hit in the same way. These issues are entirely out of our control&#8212;indeed, they are entirely out of British control. The American authorities are two years ahead of the British authorities, and have taken a lead, so they will dictate the time scale for what comes next. Whether the considerations are legal or political&#8212;there are elections coming up, so there may well be more of a political imperative to be seen to be doing things&#8212;they will have grave consequences for these financial institutions and the British taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="d.799.1/3">That is why although it may well come up with worthy and credible recommendations, the investigation cannot match the task that it has been set. Because of the course of events and the changes that will happen, arbitrary time limits are, by definition, self-defeating. There is another problem that goes alongside that, and it concerns the other options available to look at those matters. I am pleased that the Leader of the House appears to have given a commitment, and I urge him to clarify it, that no staffing resource will be removed from the Treasury Committee in that period of time. If that is the case, that is a significant step forward. If the Treasury Committee were mothballed at precisely this time, the ability of the House to respond to fast-moving events would worsen significantly.</p>
	<p pid="d.799.1/4">The Treasury Committee has a heavy workload. Today, Commissioner Barnier was supposed to appear before the Committee in relation to the 17 EU directives and draft directives relating to financial services on the books at the moment. It is essential that this House properly scrutinises and takes a view on what happens with those directives, but that has not been happening&#8212;it is a key role that the Treasury Committee needs to fulfil.</p>

	<p pid="d.800.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there may well be some dispute about what the Treasury Committee should look at and what this new Commission should look at&#8212;if, for example, another scandal or something like it emerged in the next few weeks?</p>

	<p pid="d.800.1/1">My hon. Friend makes the point that I have been stressing&#8212;that we do not know and cannot predict them, but we know that there will be a lot more scandals emerging, as we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at present. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I appreciate that this is not good listening for those hon. Members trying to work out how to respond to this, but if this House is to set up arbitrary ad hoc committees at random every time there is a problem, it will potentially undermine itself. Which Select Committee will be next to give away some of its powers to an ad hoc committee? Is this the appropriate way to determine such matters?</p>
	<p pid="d.800.1/2">If some of the powers set out in the motion were reinforced not just in respect of the Treasury Select Committee but of other Select Committees, that would reinforce the scrutiny of this House over what goes on both in government and in the country, so there are some good proposals here. The good proposals, however, are bespoke to this particular Commission&#8212;for example, the ability to call in a QC and the ability to take evidence on oath.

	<p pid="d.801.0/1">I think the hon. Gentleman is making some powerful and important points. Does he share my surprise that the Treasury Select Committee was not given this role? He is absolutely right: these powers should be given to all Select Committees to make Parliament more powerful.</p>

	<p pid="d.801.1/1">I take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point and I agree with him, but I do not intend to go through all the previous debate on this issue&#8212;interesting though it would be to do so&#8212;because I am sticking to the detail of what is in front of us, however badly it is worded. There is, however, clearly a case for saying that if the Treasury Committee had been allowed to carry on this work, it could have done so as effectively as this Joint Committee. I am sure that the five Members from the House of Lords who are as yet unknown and unnamed will bring great wisdom to this Joint Committee, but if the House of Lords wants to look into matters, it can look into them. This is the elected Chamber, and for this elected Chamber to hand over some of these powers of scrutiny to an unelected Chamber seems a retrograde step, which will come back to haunt us in future.</p>
	<p pid="d.801.1/2">Once a precedent has been established and it suits the Government, it is likely to happen again&#8212;and this was a Government initiative. I am rather surprised that the Opposition Front-Bench team, perhaps looking forward to being in government themselves, have been seduced into accepting this way of undermining the historic, developed and improving role of this House to scrutinise. That, I think, is partly what is at stake here, if this becomes the way of doing business in this House.</p>
	<p pid="d.801.1/3">I do not see how a Select Committee, denuded of half its members, can in any way work as effectively as a Select Committee operating with all its members. That is the reality of what will happen, and we need to be aware of the unintended consequences that might come from a potential eurozone crisis and other problems emanating from Europe that conflict across the work of this Joint Committee&#8212;and are wrongly not referred to within it&#8212;because proposals from Brussels are, rightly or wrongly, a fundamental part of the equation, affecting decisions made by this House and by the banking industry in this country and across the world. That aspect has been ducked by the creation of the Commission, which will create unhealthy confusion in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.801.1/4">What should have happened? The remit given to the investigation, which should have been carried out by the Treasury Committee, should have been far broader&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> An hon. Gentleman says &#8220;Boring&#8221; from a sedentary position, but this is not boring. For example, seven investment banks colluded to rig the price of the Kraft takeover of Cadbury&#8217;s. That is the real scandal that underpins the profits in investment banking. In some areas, there is ferocious competition, but in the vast majority of investment banking, there is no competition whatever. That is the scandal that created the culture that led to the LIBOR rigging. An investment bank called in by a company to advise on a sale or takeover has so much knowledge of the workings of the company</p>
	<p pid="d.801.1/5">that it has the ability to manipulate the market to determine how things will go. That is the fundamental weakness in the system of investment banking. The implications for British manufacturing and manufacturing elsewhere in the world&#8212;</p>

Gentleman&#8217;s references to investment banking, but I fear&#8212;very considerably&#8212;that he is now going to proceed to discuss the state of British manufacturing and any relationship between the banking and manufacturing sectors. He is gyrating between referring to the terms of reference of the Commission and matters of composition, and then talking about matters that are quite outwith the terms of the motion, which ought to afford him adequate scope. I feel cautiously hopeful that he may be nearer to the end of his remarks than to the beginning.</p>

	<p pid="d.802.1/1">I have so far got to paragraph (1)(b) of the motion, which I shall quote, so that you are assured, Mr Speaker, that my remarks are directly pertinent. Paragraph (1)(b) refers to</p>
	<p pid="d.802.1/2">&#8220;lessons to be learned about corporate governance, transparency and conflicts of interest, and their implications for regulation and for Government policy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.802.1/3">That is precisely what I was talking about in relation to how investment banks operate. The lack of transparency, conflicts of interests and the narrow remit&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.802.2/1">Order. I am sure the hon. Gentleman is public spirited and trying to be helpful, but he should not misunderstand the terms of the motion. The paragraph to which he refers underlines the importance of the inquiry in learning those lessons. It is not necessary or feasible for the House to do so tonight. It would be a triumph of optimism over reality for him to suppose that the House would do so courtesy of his speech, no matter how compelling it is.</p>

	<p pid="d.802.3/1">Thank you for that guidance, Mr Speaker. I am merely outlining my objections to the lack of breadth in the remit given to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.802.3/2">My final questions on paragraph (1)(b)&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hooray!&#8221;] I am surprised hon. Members are so keen to stay and hear the debate, given some of their sedentary comments. It would be helpful if the Leader of the House confirmed unambiguously that the principles behind the setting up of the Commission will in no way&#8212;practically and in reality&#8212;undermine the ability of the Treasury Committee to meet as often as it has over the past year to discuss subjects that it chooses to investigate. It would help if he confirmed that it can call the witnesses it chooses and that it will have the access to the staffing resource and expertise that it currently has. If he can give those assurances, I will not seek to divide the House on the motion. I look forward to hearing from him.</p>

	<p pid="d.802.4/1">I want to make a brief point about paragraph (1)(a), which sets out the terms of reference. Some months ago there were reports, which I raised with the Prime Minister, about the Bank of England&#8217;s intervention with at least one bank, and perhaps more, about the manipulation of the quantitative easing auctions. I would welcome an</p>
	<p pid="d.802.4/2">assurance that paragraph (1)(a) will cover that issue as well, rather than just the LIBOR issue, because it is a matter of concern if a single bank or a number of banks sought to profiteer from the quantitative easing that was put in place by the Government to rescue the banks. Indeed, it seems extraordinary that the banks would seek to profiteer from the taxpayers&#8217; money that was used to intervene and save them from the crisis that they had brought about. I would welcome an assurance from the Chair of the inquiry that that matter, as well as LIBOR, will be looked into when we consider the issue of transparency and the ability of the banks to manipulate the system overall.</p>

	<p pid="d.803.0/1">I have quite fundamental reservations about the motion before us this evening, because, a bit like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, I have serious concerns about the implications for the work of the Treasury Committee. The way in which we are moving to set up the Commission, with a selection of members of the Treasury Committee&#8212;almost a Treasury Committee A team&#8212;being assigned to the Commission, will obviously have an impact on the Committee&#8217;s working capacity at a key time.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/2">We heard from the Chancellor in the Chamber two weeks ago that he was appointing Martin Wheatley, the incoming chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, to conduct a review that would report within six weeks. That review was going to make recommendations that could feed into reconsideration of the Financial Services Bill. I would have thought that the outcome of the Wheatley review would be the subject of serious consideration by the Treasury Committee. I also wonder how the House would consider the implications of that urgent review, which the Chancellor has instigated, under Martin Wheatley. Will the Financial Services Bill Committee be reconstituted or will we just receive scrambled amendments? There will be confusion, because the Wheatley review is meant to come up with recommendations for legislative change&#8212;through the Financial Services Bill first, but possibly also through the banking reform Bill, which the Government have told us is due in the new year. Surely the journey to the banking reform Bill should involve serious consideration and pre-legislative scrutiny by the Treasury Committee, and perhaps others too.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/3">I am not sure how the Treasury Committee can perform its usual role of giving such key legislative consideration if so many of its members and its Chairman are absorbed in the inquiry that this motion establishes&#8212;an inquiry that will be intensive and could even turn out to be extensive, in terms of the issues it gets into. We as a House are asking the Commission to surf a very dense, murky and smelly swamp in short order and come up with clear findings and recommendations. We are assigning it quite an inordinate task, which not only will be hard to achieve in itself, but will end up damaging the work of the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/4">As someone who sat on the Financial Services Bill Committee, I was conscious of the fact that we had many members of the Treasury Committee serving on that Committee. I was also struck, however, by the fact that they resiled from positions that they had agreed to, as members of the Treasury Select Committee, in their very good report into aspects of the Financial Services</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/5">Bill. It was quite common for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> to make points in that Bill Committee in which he quoted extensively from the Treasury Select Committee report, only for members of the Select Committee to disown the report or distance themselves from it. I was almost expecting them to say that they were not inextricably linked to their membership of the Select Committee in that particular capacity. That experience gives me concern about splitting the attention and capacity of the Treasury Select Committee in this way, and I worry that this might be a well-motivated misadventure in regard to its implications for the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/6">I hope that the Leader of the House will be able to clarify the Government&#8217;s hopes and intentions in relation to the timing of the Financial Services Bill and any amendments that they believe should be made to it in the light of the LIBOR scandal, given the Chancellor&#8217;s statement two weeks ago, and in relation to the banking reform Bill. There appear to be potentially overlapping and intersecting reviews going on, and if we in this Chamber are mandating them, we need to take responsibility for the possible confusion that could be caused to others and to ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/7">I do not believe that these arrangements will be enough to deal with the scale of the problem or the questions that it raises not only about banking but about the competence and due diligence of this Parliament. Are we as parliamentarians up to the task of properly scrutinising legislation and introducing regulatory changes? Is it enough for us to devolve the task to a group of people hand-picked from the Treasury Select Committee by the Whips and expect them to come up with all the answers while we take responsibility only for receiving them? I do not think that that is good enough.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/8">I did not vote for a parliamentary inquiry device when we voted on the matter the week before last, but I accept that this is the chosen outcome. I have serious reservations about the way in which the terms of reference for the Commission have been laid out here, and about the possibility of its composition weakening the Treasury Select Committee at a key time when two Bills are due to come back to us in the autumn, along with another Bill in the new year. I am also worried about the Committee&#8217;s ability to deal with other unfolding revelations that might emerge not only from the LIBOR scandal but from issues relating to quantitative easing, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> referred, and to deal with the outflow from the machinations in the eurozone.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/9">There is a lot of work for the Treasury Select Committee to concentrate on, and I am not sure that it will be assisted by the creation of this device. If the Committee is content with the arrangement, I will have to accept its opinion. However, that does not absolve us in this Chamber from our legislative responsibility in respect of those two Bills, which the Chancellor has told us could be directly relevant and whose scope and reach will need to be adjusted to take account of the LIBOR scandal and possibly other scandals as well.</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/10">I have profound reservations, but I wish those who are undertaking the inquiry well. They have a difficult task ahead of them, and I do not know how they are meant to perform it if, as the motion suggests, they will sometimes be expected to work as sub-Committees of</p>
	<p pid="d.803.0/11">one. That would create the bizarre scenario of a sub-Committee of one relying on the hired specialist advisers and other agents who will be licensed by this motion. That would create some fairly peculiar scenarios that Parliament might find hard to stand over. Members of the Commission might also find it hard comfortably to take ownership of all the undertakings of the Commission, given the odd construct that is provided for in the motion. I accept that this is a scramble in particular circumstances, and that time is pressing. However, I am not sure that it has been a good scramble. I think that there should have been better thought and more consideration, and I think that many of the people who are comfortable with this device now may end up regretting their decision.</p>

	<p pid="d.805.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40264" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase>, who is always worth listening to, but I have to say that on this occasion I disagreed with many of the points he made. I think that this is a chance for Parliament to assert itself. I think that it is a new adventure for Parliament. If the Commission is successful&#8212;if it produces a report that is unanimous and not split along party lines, and if it uses all the additional powers that it is being given&#8212;that will be a great step forward, and the arrangement may be repeated in the future. I take a much more optimistic view than the hon. Gentleman. The fact that so many Members are in the Chamber late at night shows how interested they are in the issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.0/2">I have just two questions to put to the Leader of the House. One concerns paragraph (3), which names the members of the Commission. I am not sure how they were selected. I would have found it understandable for all the members of the Treasury Committee to be members of the Commission, because they were elected to their positions, but how did these particular names come to be here? Certain other Members&#8217; names are not here although perhaps they should be. I am surprised, for instance, that a certain lady Member&#8217;s name is not included. Was it purple smoke, or was it, as I fear, the usual channels? Perhaps the Leader of the House could clear that up.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.0/3">I welcome the Leader of the House&#8217;s announcement of an open-ended commitment from the Treasury to provide money for the counsel to the Commission. Does he hope, like me, that the counsel will act rather like a congressional committee and will grill the witnesses, and that members of the Commission will then be able to ask questions? I think that if we set up that sort of arrangement, we shall be moving Parliament forward.</p>

	<p pid="d.805.1/1">Let me begin by reiterating the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase>, who said that we had voted for a judge-led inquiry. We are setting an onerous task for the Commission. I think it was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> who said that it would be looked at very closely by members of the public, who now have very little faith in our banking system, whether because of national scandals or because of their dealings with their own local banks.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/2">The terms of reference are set out clearly in paragraph (1)(a), which mentions the</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/3">&#8220;professional standards and culture of the UK banking sector&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/4">I should be interested to know how &#8220;culture&#8221; is defined in the context of banking. Does it refer only to banks, or to building societies as well? We should bear it in mind that the banking industry consists of not only high-street chains but, for instance, mutual societies. Will they be included in the Commission&#8217;s investigation?</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/5">LIBOR was the catalyst for the establishment of the Commission. Paragraph (1)(b) refers to</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/6">&#8220;lessons to be learned about corporate governance, transparency and conflicts of interest, and their implications for regulation and for Government policy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/7">You pulled up my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw on the issue of corporate governance, Mr Speaker, and I accept your ruling. However, many of the matters that the Commission will consider will not relate purely to banking. As my hon. Friend said, they will relate to lending and takeover bids for companies. Will the Commission look into the culture of, for example, the Kraft takeover, which my hon. Friend mentioned? If it restricts its consideration to the banking sector, will not the inquiry be of limited use, not just in view of the vehicles involved in such events as the Kraft takeover but&#8212;I hasten to add&#8212;in view of some of the things that have been going on in local government? I have raised the issue of the refinancing of Newcastle airport, for example, which was a huge scandal in the north-east two years ago. That was driven by the idea that we could get a better deal for the local council tax payer by refinancing. In fact, it got them a worse deal. Will the Committee look at such situations?</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/8">Turning to transparency and governance, Government Members had strong opinions about private finance initiative deals when they were in opposition, and they still hold to those views now. Will such financing arrangements fall within the remit of paragraph (1)(a) and (b), as they are clearly part of a new culture that has emerged, and they are a new mechanism for funding Government policy? Paragraph (1)(b) refers to</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/9">&#8220;implications for regulation and for Government policy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/10">Would today&#8217;s announcements on the investment in the railways fall within the remit? That is being financed in part through Network Rail, which is a completely separate organisation and is off the Government balance sheet. The Committee&#8217;s remit could lead to such areas being investigated. There are some wider implications here, therefore, and it will be interesting to see if the Committee resists going down certain paths. If we do not have a full inquiry that looks at all these areas, the public may well think we are just concentrating on a small part of the banking and finance industry, when there are many other concerns that directly affect them, too.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/11">I have great respect for the Chair of the Treasury Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, who will chair this Commission, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> mentioned the absence of any women on the nomination list from this House. Are we saying that there are no able hon. Ladies from either side of the House who could sit on this Committee? We have in the past tried to ensure that all Committees in this House include women Members. This is an omission, therefore. It may be possible that all the</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/12">members from the House of Lords will be men, too. We would therefore have a Committee made up entirely of males, which would be very wrong. It would be right to include a certain&#8212;female&#8212;member of the Treasury Committee on the Commission. Obviously that hon. Lady did not fit the loyalty criteria set by the usual channels, however. Her inclusion could have been useful, especially in light of her previous life in the banking industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/13">We are going to agree this motion tonight when we do not know who the Lords members of the Committee will be. I agree with the position of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw: this is a slippery slope as we are agreeing to have a Joint Committee to scrutinise and make recommendations with some members who have never been elected&#8212;and some of whom are, perhaps, unelectable.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/14">Another interesting question is what the powers of this Committee will be. Paragraph (7)(a) states that it will have the power to</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/15">&#8220;send for persons, papers and records&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/16">What will happen if an individual says, &#8220;No&#8221;? Will the Committee have the full powers of Parliament to enforce its will in this regard?</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/17">It is also stated that witnesses will be under oath, and also that the Committee will be able to appoint special advisers. That is very important in respect of the expertise it will bring to the Committee. There is a question to be asked about a possible declaration of interests by those individuals, however. Many of the people who have expertise in this field will have had direct involvement in the culture that this Committee will be examining. So what will be the restrictions on the appointment of those advisers in respect of either their past lives or any future involvement they may have? That needs to be spelt out from the beginning. We need to make sure that they have not got their fingers in any of the pies that this Commission is investigating.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/18">I do not wish to cast aspersions on any members of the Commission from this House, but we do not know who its members will be from the other House. How are we to define declarations of interest? Are these interests that those individuals hold now or in previous lives? If they are commercial interests, that will raise questions about the impartiality of those individuals, and anything that does that will damage the Commission from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/19">Paragraph (7)(d) has already been mentioned. It states:</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/20">&#8220;to invite specialist advisers (including Counsel appointed as specialist advisers) to examine witnesses&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/21">I am not sure what that means. The normal procedure that Select Committees follow is that the members ask the questions, and questions and briefing notes are clearly written in advance by advisers. This arrangement, however, is very different. This is about having special advisers being able to cross-examine witnesses. So what is the status of those individuals? As the hon. Member for Wellingborough has said, that is a huge change from the way in which Select Committees have operated in this House. When I served on the Select Committee on Defence we had some very able advisers, but the idea that they would cross-examine witnesses is a strange one. We need clarification on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/22">What about specialist advisers and conflicts of interest? If they are going to be counsel, we need to ask whether they have ever acted for banks or financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/23">Would that debar them from being appointed as an adviser to the Commission? It is important that we have those things laid out clearly right at the beginning. I do not think it is right to leave them up to the Committee or the Chair to determine.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/24" class="italic">[Interruption.]</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/25">Government Members may well think that this is frivolous, but to many of our constituents it will be very important, in terms not only of how their money is looked after, but of trying to get credibility back into a sector that is vital to this country&#8217;s economy. This is very important in terms of making sure we get it right and of the reputation of the Members of this House who are going to be serving on the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/26">The other thing I wish to discuss is how the Commission is going to be financed. Paragraph (13) says that</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/27">&#8220;the costs of the Commission shall be assessed by the House of Commons Commission from time to time and shall be paid by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government for the credit of the House of Commons (Administration) Estimate.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/28">We all know that, if someone wants to control the activities of a committee or any organisation, they can starve it of money. Are we saying that this Commission has a blank cheque? Unless it has, the Government will be able to starve it of money and limit the scope of its activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/29">Paragraph (7)(e) states that the Commission can</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/30">&#8220;adjourn from place to place&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/31">If a lot of foreign travel is involved, as may well be the case, that will create an expense. Who makes the determination on that in terms of the work the Commission does? Will the Treasury at some point try to limit it by saying, &#8220;I am sorry, but you have spent too much and so you cannot undertake that foreign travel or employ that expert witness to interrogate and produce the report&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/32">There are a lot of&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40219" name="Angie Bray">The hon. Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray)</phrase> is chuntering from a sedentary position, but she has only just come into the Chamber. I know that she did not have a very good week last week, but I wish her all the best for the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.805.1/33">The financing of the Commission will be very important, so we need some assurance that we will not have interference by Government in the Commission&#8217;s work by stealth&#8212;that is, by starving it of the resources it needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.808.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making serious points about parliamentary scrutiny, and it is great that so many Government Members are present to support him. Does he welcome this new initiative? If there is unlimited funding, if there can be counsel and if the Commission can cross-examine in the same way as congressional committees, is that not a good thing?</p>

	<p pid="d.808.1/1">It is&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Ah!] Hon. Members have not heard what I am going to say yet. I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but we have seen this problem with Select Committees, whose travel was limited in the previous Parliament, hampering their work. As the Commission will be subject to the Government&#8217;s decision on whether they can fund it or not, that is a very important point. If the situation will be that suggested by the hon. Gentleman, we should have the same arrangements for Select Committees. That would ensure that Select Committees could not only employ the proper advisers&#8212;and perhaps more of them&#8212;and see expert witnesses but undertake the detailed travel that is sometimes required.</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/2">My other concern is paragraph (12)(b), which concerns the setting up of sub-committees. There is no detail about how sub-committees will be set up or about their composition. Paragraph (12)(b) states that a sub-committee will have a quorum of one, but how big will the committees be?</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/3">I am very uncomfortable with the idea of a sub-committee of one person making decisions or taking evidence. It should include at least one person from each House: a Member from this House and one from the other House. Likewise, on the question of political balance, it could include a Government Member and an Opposition Member. If we are going to have sub-committees, surely it would be right to increase the quorum to at least two, one from each House, and, potentially, to try to get political balance.</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/4">There are many provisions in the motion that prompt many questions. The hon. Member for Wellingborough made a very good point, in that it sets a lot of precedents and, I hope, sets a way forward that Select Committees can follow to draw down more resources and increase their powers.</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/5">I also want to raise the issue of the Commission&#8217;s reports. The motion states that it will</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/6">&#8220;report from time to time.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/7">Who will decide? If the Commission as a whole decides to produce interim reports or short reports throughout its life, some of them will be very market sensitive. Will not the Commission have to be very cautious in what it releases? I am sure that many finance houses, banks and other parts of the financial sector will be looking very closely at what the Commission recommends, and it could affect the share prices of those organisations. There is no guidance in the motion about how those reports should be produced, according to what time scale and for what reasons.</p>
	<p pid="d.808.1/8">The other question that was mentioned earlier is whether we are happy now that we have basically set up a new type of Select Committee. Personally, I am not. I think that this inquiry would have been far better done by the Treasury Committee. Obviously, those on the Front Bench from my own party argued strongly for a judicial-led inquiry, which was the right approach to get confidence in the banking system. In the absence of such an inquiry, the Treasury Committee would perhaps have been a better vehicle. I worry about the precedent that this sets and whether it will allow the Government of the day to dictate to Select Committees or hybrid Committees. That goes to the heart of the independence of those Committees and their accountability to Parliament. The Commission will have a huge job to do and I wish it well in its deliberations, but we should undertake a serious examination of the new system and the precedent that that sets for our Select Committees.</p>

	<p pid="d.814.2/1">This issue has already been raised today in the debate on a motion in the main business of the House, but I believe that the growing concern about rationing in the NHS justifies further debate tonight. For almost as long as the NHS has existed, rationing has been a matter of concern. Resources are finite, but in the past two years rationing has reached an unprecedented level; more than 125 previously free treatments have now been restricted or even stopped altogether, and they cover the full health care spectrum, from the cosmetic to the essential and all stages in between.</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/2">These findings were revealed in a survey, carried out by Labour&#8217;s shadow health team, of all NHS primary care trusts and shadow clinical commissioning groups in England. It is important to state the relevance of Labour&#8217;s new NHS check, which I will refer to in my speech, because as well as conducting surveys it gathers together the views of those working in the health service and takes into account the views of those receiving the service and their families. The submissions are considered alongside evidence from freedom of information requests to produce an accurate and relevant monthly report, such as the one on rationing.</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/3">Labour&#8217;s findings are backed by members of the British Medical Association who warn that creeping NHS rationing is making patients suffer unnecessarily, with people who need hip and knee replacements having to wait longer for operations while suffering in pain. GPs believe that the rationing is the result of the drive to make savings in the NHS of up to &#163;20 billion by 2015. That is further borne out by the results of a poll conducted by the BBC in March, which found that more than four out of five GPs expect the rationing of NHS care to increase in response to financial pressure.</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/4">The concerns of the medical profession are echoed by other professions in the health service. Ahead of this debate I was contacted by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, which is very concerned about the rationing of NHS physiotherapy services and has a number of examples of patient care and outcomes suffering as a result. The CSP opposed the Health and Social Care Bill and the Government&#8217;s reforms to the NHS because of concerns about the negative impact on patient care resulting from rationing and the fragmentation of services. It is particularly concerned about the &#8220;any qualified provider&#8221; model and has found that patient choice is being adversely affected by the clear rationing of treatment and access in some of the &#8220;any qualified provider&#8221; service specifications, which it has systematically reviewed. For example, in Nottinghamshire the amount of treatment prescribed is limited without regard to patient need. In other areas, no re-referrals are allowed within a six or 12-month period, also regardless of patient need. This rationing is likely to lead to increased orthopaedic referrals and unnecessary surgical interventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/5">The CSP has further concerns about the impact of the &#8220;any qualified provider&#8221; model, including a reduction in patient choice and the quality of care, the loss of clinically and cost-effective innovations such as self-referral</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/6">to physiotherapy, the negative impact on the physiotherapy profession and the risk of conflicts of interest among private providers. Those are all legitimate concerns from a respected professional body, so I hope that the Minister will address them specifically with the society.</p>
	<p pid="d.814.2/7">The Minister has denied the relevance of the shadow Health team&#8217;s extensive survey, the NHS check, but perhaps he should reconsider his opinion of it, because the survey&#8217;s findings mirror those of <i>GP</i> magazine, which gathered evidence under the Freedom of Information Act, showing that 90% of primary care trusts were imposing restrictions. The magazine received responses from two thirds of England&#8217;s 151 trusts on the procedures that they considered to be non-urgent. The most common restriction was on tonsillectomies, but there was rationing in other areas, too.</p>

	<p pid="d.815.4/1">I certainly will, and my hon. Friend may find that at the end of my speech I reiterate some of what he has said.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/2">There is rationing in other areas, too, with 66% of trusts limiting cataract surgery and more than half rationing weight-loss surgery and hip and knee operations. Dr Richard Vautrey of the British Medical Association describes the situation as a &#8220;cost-saving exercise&#8221;, saying quite rightly:</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/3">&#8220;Patients fully understand the NHS doesn&#8217;t have unlimited resources...but they don&#8217;t understand, or believe it&#8217;s fair, when services are provided in one area but not another.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/4">The Labour party&#8217;s survey provides evidence of random rationing throughout the NHS, and of an accelerating postcode lottery. A number of rationed or decommissioned treatments are common across several PCTs and clinical commissioning groups, while some are specific to individual PCTs and CCGs. That demonstrates the wide variation throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/5">The survey found that rationing of treatment varies from capping, as in NHS South West Essex and NHS South East Essex, where a cap has been placed on the community diabetes service, to restricting treatment based on age or clinical need, as in NHS Warwickshire,</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/6">where new criteria require that a patient must complain of intense or severe symptomatology and have a BMI of less than 40 to be listed for a knee replacement.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/7">Evidence also showed, alarmingly, that PCTs and CCGs are diverging from the NICE guidelines, as in NHS Bassetlaw, where needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture is considered only if the patient is aged over 45 and has a loss of extension in one or more joints exceeding 25&#176;, or if the patient is under 45 years old and has a greater than 10&#176; loss of extension in two or more joints. However, the NICE guidelines do not refer to degree of loss of extension or any specific age criteria, other than to say that the procedure would be more appropriate in older people.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/8">Equally alarming are the findings that show that patients now have to pay for treatments that had been free. In a surgery in Yorkshire, patients needing treatments for cysts, skin lesions and in-growing toenails were told that they were no longer available on the NHS. But the practice had established a private company to offer those minor operations at a cost: &#163;56.30 for the removal of a small cyst; &#163;126 for larger cysts; &#163;146.95 for the removal of an in-growing toenail; and &#163;243 for the removal of a non-cancerous mole.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/9">In response to the <i>GP</i> magazine report, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/10">&#8220;It is quite unacceptable if this is going on in all those cases. As you&#8217;ll appreciate, it is a complex issue. But the defining point is that people should be treated on clinical need, and not financial considerations.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/11">The findings of the BMA, the concerns of other health professionals, such as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, and the results of Labour&#8217;s in-depth survey all point to the fact that, because of increasing rationing, people are being treated on the basis not of clinical need, but of financial considerations.</p>
	<p pid="d.815.4/12">Will the Minister respond positively to Labour&#8217;s call for an immediate review of rationing in the NHS and act immediately on the new evidence showing treatment restriction on cost alone? How will he ensure that national guidelines can be implemented? Will he take action, pending the outcome of the review, to reverse immediately rationing decisions that leave patients in severe pain, restrict mobility, limit their ability to live independently or have a major psychological impact? Will the Government initiate a public debate on whether all other treatments should be provided by the NHS, rather than allowing them to be restricted in a random fashion?</p>

	<p pid="d.817.0/1">I am listening with great interest to my hon. Friend&#8217;s speech. Does the decrease in care free at the point of delivery match the increase in the care that is then paid for by patients? Are the hospitals now offering all that care to people as long as they pay for it?</p>

	<p pid="d.817.6/3">The core principle underpinning the NHS is that it is a comprehensive health service, available to all, free at the point of use and based on need and not ability to pay.

	<p pid="d.817.8/1">It is not a question of not telling the truth. If the hon. Lady waits, I will deal with the NHS health check that she has mentioned. I am not sure whether</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/2">she was here for the earlier debate, so she might not have heard me describe it as being as worthless as the piece of paper that Chamberlain brought back from Munich. In the course of my comments, I will outline why that is.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/3">As I said, the core principle of the NHS is that it is a comprehensive health service, free at the point of use for all those eligible to use it. That principle remains as true and relevant today as it was when the NHS legislation was passed in 1946 and enacted in July 1948, and it will remain true in the years and decades to come for as long as the three main political parties continue to subscribe to that core belief.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/4">Before I move on to the specific accusations of rationing that the hon. Lady makes, may I first point out that it is this Government who are protecting NHS budgets and increasing the amount of money available to the NHS by &#163;12.5 billion over the course of this Parliament? It was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> who described such a commitment as &#8220;irresponsible&#8221;&#8212;a comment that I find particularly bizarre coming from a Labour shadow Health Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/5">May I ask what the hon. Lady&#8217;s party is doing where it is in control of the NHS? Is it increasing spending, or is it cutting it by 6.5%? The lucky escape of the NHS in England is that it has growing budgets under this Government compared with falling budgets had her party won at the last election. If the hon. Lady, who looks a bit perturbed, does not understand what I am talking about, I can tell her that I am referring to what is happening under a Labour Government in Wales who are cutting the NHS budget&#8212;a warning to anyone living in England.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/6">Of course the financial challenge is a difficult one. On its own, the extra &#163;12.5 billion will not be enough to cover the growing demand for NHS services. It is vital that we get the most value&#8212;the very best health outcomes, as we like to say&#8212;out of every single penny that taxpayers spend, by cutting out waste and focusing more on prevention. It is true that the hon. Lady&#8217;s party recognised this too. When Labour was in office, it established NICE&#8212;the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#8212;to help the NHS to improve patient care within the finite resources available to it in order to ensure value for money. Through its world-class commissioning programme, it rewarded commissioners for setting priorities. Furthermore, it first recognised the scale of the &#163;20 billion gap between funding and demand that emerged in 2009. The result was the QIPP agenda&#8212;quality, innovation, productivity and prevention&#8212;with its focus on improving patient care, increasing innovation and gaining greater accountability.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/7">Since then, the world has changed. Thanks to the horrendous mess in which the hon. Lady&#8217;s Government left the nation&#8217;s finances, the NHS faces one of the toughest financial settlements in its history, even with its protected budget. That is one reason why the Health and Social Care Act was so vital. To get the best care for patients during a difficult financial settlement, we needed to put clinicians in control&#8212;making the connection between clinical and financial decisions, always putting patients&#8217; interests first, and always looking for value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/8">In future, local priorities will be determined by local clinicians, not by administrative organisations that lack sufficient clinical input and are cut off from</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/9">patients. Commissioning decisions will be based on a far deeper understanding of local need, with clinical commissioning groups working with health and wellbeing boards, local authorities and key community organisations to meet the needs of their local population. There will be better, more effective, more efficient care for patients.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/10">Let me address directly the accusations of rationing. We are clear that it is completely unacceptable for commissioners to impose blanket bans on treatments. That is set out in case law and in Department of Health policy, which requires commissioners to allow exceptions in individual circumstances. We are also clear that commissioners must never restrict access to treatments on the basis of cost alone. That message was reiterated in a letter from Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, to the medical directors of strategic health authorities as recently as September 2011. He emphasised that any decision to restrict access to a treatment or intervention must be justified by a patient&#8217;s individual circumstances. By that, I mean not their financial circumstances, but their clinical circumstances and condition.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/11">Since then, my ministerial colleagues and I have reiterated the message in our communications with the service that treatments available on the NHS are based on clinical need; that there should never be any arbitrary rationing based on cost, either locally or nationally; and that we will take action against any organisation found to be arbitrarily restricting treatment without clinical justification.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/12">As hon. Lady said, the Labour party recently made a series of serious accusations in its NHS health check&#8212;accusations that services are being restricted or decommissioned without clinical justification. Had the hon. Lady done some rudimentary checking of her own, she would quickly have come to the same conclusion that we did: that such claims are nonsense dreamed up in Labour party headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/13">The NHS health check claimed that there was a blanket ban by NHS Hull on the removal of wrist ganglia. We spoke with NHS Hull. There is no such ban. The health check claimed that 11 out of 100 primary care trusts or clinical commissioning groups restricted laser revision surgery for scars, but such cosmetic surgery has never been routinely available on the NHS, either in the lifetime of the coalition Government or in the 13 years of the last Labour Government. The position has not changed one iota since the Government came to power.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/14">The NHS health check claimed that weight-loss surgery is restricted. It states:</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/15">&#8220;patients generally have to be over 18 and have a BMI over a certain level to receive weight loss surgery&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.817.8/16">Incredibly, people have to be overweight before they will be considered for weight loss surgery. To me, that seems perfectly logical. Why would the NHS want to treat people who were not overweight? From reading the Opposition&#8217;s NHS health check, it appears that the Opposition define rationing as a clinician denying treatment to a patient who has no clinical need for it. That is patently ridiculous. Treatments available on the NHS are based on clinical need. As I said, there should never be any arbitrary rationing based on cost, either locally or nationally. Such practices are totally unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="d.820.0/1">I have listened very carefully to the Minister, who is saying that he does not believe the reports are true. Does he feel, however, that he ought to do more investigation? The BMA&#8217;s research and other research makes these points, whereas he simply says he has spoken to one commissioning group.

	<p pid="d.820.1/1">Of course the Government take these allegations very seriously, which is why my officials rang NHS Hull to ask about wrist ganglia and were amazed to be told that there were no restrictions as described in the Labour party&#8217;s political leaflet. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40684" name="Debbie Abrahams">the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)</phrase> will just hush for a minute, I will answer the question. I am always very pleasant to her, as she knows from experience.</p>
	<p pid="d.820.1/2">I have personally made checks on two allegations about rationing, one in south-east Essex, south of my constituency, and one that I believe from memory was in Bedfordshire. My officials investigated both claims, which arose out of a meeting that I had with a clinician, and both claims were untrue. There had been a mistaken understanding of what was going on, and there was no rationing based on cost. The conditions in each trust were quite specific, and cases were determined on clinical grounds.</p>
	<p pid="d.820.1/3">I also looked into one example after reading a story in my local newspaper about what was allegedly going on in the mid-Essex primary care trust, which is now part of the north Essex cluster. It was to do with the treatment of people suffering from overweight. Again, the story was inaccurate. There was no truth in the allegation that the trust was refusing to treat smokers or people who were overweight. They were treated, providing that it was clinically safe to do so. The three specific allegations that I have investigated, both myself and through my officials, have proved to be untrue.</p>
	<p pid="d.820.1/4">As I said earlier, we have had officials look at the Labour party&#8217;s political document because, on the face of it, it raised serious allegations that merited investigation. I am afraid that the examples that I have given have not met the reality of the headline claims.</p>
