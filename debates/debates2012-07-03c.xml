	<p pid="c.738.13/1">I wish to visit Blundeston to see a number of examples of good practice, not just those to do with work in prisons. We have developed a code of practice to demonstrate how we will work fairly to address concerns about unfair competition and protecting local jobs. It is vital that the growth in prison work add to the UK supply chain and increase rather than reduce employment opportunities for law-abiding citizens while aiding the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

	<p pid="c.739.0/1">Many education providers these days use online platforms and tools to provide education in prison and would like to do so more often using both better internet connections and better wi-fi internet connection.

	<p pid="c.739.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend because, as he says, it is essential to maintain security while enabling learning and skills to be relevant in prisons. Prisoners&#8217; educational internet access will now be via the virtual campus that is being installed where it is technically possible to do so in all adult prisons in England. It offers very secure access to online tools and resources that have been through thorough quality assurance and rigorous security checks, and has the potential to be developed so that prisoners&#8217; in-cell time as well as their out-of-cell time could be much more productive than it is today.</p>

	<p pid="c.739.3/1">That is complete nonsense. There has been a culture change across the whole of the prison system, and prison governors are stepping up to the plate and driving the agenda forward. At the same time, we have taken an enormous amount of trouble to put in place a code of practice and the necessary policy underpinnings so that we can take work in prisons to the maximum level that we can achieve. There is a profound change under way involving substantial and substantive work and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support us in that endeavour.</p>

	<p pid="c.739.5/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the integrated offender management that already happens in the case of prolific offenders, who tend to be drug addicted. Their support or treatment will be related, to a degree, to how they engage with their offender managers and their drug treatment providers in the community, which involves police, probation, health and local authority services all working together. That rather obvious, sensible example of integrated offender management is getting much wider traction across the whole offender management system. The hon. Gentleman is quite right: it is the way forward when all those agencies operate together. That is the purpose of all the work that we are doing with other Government Departments to advance that agenda.</p>

We had a conference at Brighton of all 47 member states and produced the Brighton declaration. Our considerable achievement there was not very widely reported because, not surprisingly, the media regarded it as a footnote to the Abu Qatada case which was in the newspapers at the time. Forty-seven countries agreed that we should have a greater margin of appreciation, to use the jargon, and that more regard should be paid to those decisions of the courts of nation states which had obviously addressed their obligations under the convention. That will have a considerable impact on future cases.</p>

Sometimes that 2% includes cases where there is widespread support here for the decision, such as the holding of DNA and other information belonging to people who have never been convicted of a criminal offence, which was a recent judgment. The convention still has a very important role to play across Europe. It is hugely significant in the 47 member states and it enables standards to be applied in places all the way from Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan across to us and Iceland. We have always been subject to the rule of law. We have always bound ourselves under the convention to accept the judgments. These are the standards that we all agreed upon after the second world war, which were not challenged in this country till 10 or 15 years ago, when some judgments here began to annoy sections of the media.</p>

It will mean that there is a champion for victims in every single area; it will ensure the greater integration of such services with the police, who have a very important duty in relation to victims; and it will be for elected police and crime commissioners, accountable to the public, to ensure that they provide a high-quality service to victims.</p>

There is important work going on in the local criminal justice system in relation to women&#8217;s offending. Police and crime commissioners will have a role, in liaison with the local criminal justice agencies.

There is a risk of specialist services falling between the cracks&#8212;looking after the detail makes a difference&#8212;and such services are not likely to win PCC votes.

The cross-party Association of Police and Crime Commissioners has already welcomed the proposal, and the youth charity Catch22 says it believes that police and crime commissioners generally have the potential to bring real coherence at the local level to the planning and commissioning of services designed to reduce and prevent crime and support victims.

	<p pid="c.744.2/1">As the published impact assessment for the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 makes clear, the continuing regime of life sentences and a new mandatory life sentence for a second very serious offence, as well as longer custodial periods and extended licence periods, all supported by compulsory sentence plans and multi-agency public protection arrangements&#8212;MAPPA&#8212;supervision, will ensure that there are sufficient measures to manage risk and uphold public protection.</p>

	<p pid="c.744.4/1">There are no immediate proposals to change the release test. In March, there were 3,500 IPP prisoners serving beyond their tariff, a result of the administrative chaos that followed the unwise introduction of the sentence, with wholly unforeseen numbers being given such a sentence. I draw the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s attention to the fact that, in addition to the measures I have outlined, violent offender orders and sex offending prevention orders will be available to the courts to use for public protection.</p>

	<p pid="c.744.6/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right: such sentences consume substantial resources, not just in the offender management system but in the Parole Board and elsewhere.

	<p pid="c.745.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. We inherited a serious administrative problem in that the capacity of the offender management system was being overwhelmed by the number of people with indeterminate sentences&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>It is absolutely not the judge&#8217;s fault; it is the fault of the previous Administration, who failed to put in place the resources to deal with the sentences that they then passed in the House.

The probation trusts have now all been set up and we are introducing principles to bring some competition and diversity of provider. There are very good people who can provide some aspects of the probation service. We believe that that will both enhance the quality of the service and achieve better value for money and better outcomes. Plenty of people in the probation service welcome our proposals; indeed, some are surprised by their modesty.</p>

This is a rather sterile debate of a few decades ago about whether there should be private sector or public sector provision.

A group of young people from the organisation recently came to give evidence to the Justice Committee for its youth justice inquiry. It was striking to hear them say that having respect for the status and position of a youth offending team worker is not the same thing as connecting with them and having them make a reasonable difference to their lives. Does the Minister agree that there has to be a much greater role for offenders and ex-offenders in steering young people away from the spiral of offending and constant reoffending?</p>

If we let everybody go on until whatever age, we will get into difficulties and politicians or somebody else will have to start appraising their performance, as they cannot be dismissed peremptorily.

	<p pid="c.765.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for husbands and civil partners of those receiving honours to be allowed to use equivalent honorary titles to those available to women; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/3">The aim of this Bill is to ensure that husbands and civil partners of dames and baronesses should be allowed to use a title of some sort if they wish to do so. I feel that the position regarding honours should and needs to be reviewed. I became aware of this anomaly in 1992 when, as a Conservative party agent in Mitcham and Morden, I was working for Angela Rumbold. After a long and distinguished ministerial career, and on ceasing to be the Minister of State at the Home Office, Angela became the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, was in charge of candidates and was created a dame by the then Prime Minister and hon. Member for Huntingdon, the right hon. John Major. I remember that being an enormous honour for my friend, for whom I had served for nearly 10 years at that time, but I felt some sorrow for her husband John, who received no recognition for his support&#8212;and his finance&#8212;throughout her time as a councillor in the royal borough of Kingston upon Thames and her 10 years as the Member of Parliament for Mitcham and Morden.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/4">At the time, I felt that that was unjust, and I vowed to try to correct the anomaly should I ever have the opportunity to do so. Just recently, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> became a knight bachelor in Her Majesty&#8217;s birthday honours list, and I am delighted that his work in this House has been recognised. Although his wife is rightly allowed use the term &#8220;Lady&#8221; as a prefix to her name, the late John Rumbold received no acknowledgment on his wife becoming a dame of the British empire. Similarly, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40674" name="Peter Bottomley">the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)</phrase> was not recognised while his wife sat in the other place as the Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, until he was made a knight bachelor.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/5">I am not going to argue that wives of peers or knights should be forced to give up their ladyship titles. I fear to do so would get me into a great deal of hot water, not only with the readers of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, but with my dear Aunt Juliet. Although I have concentrated on Members of this House and the other place, this issue is replicated in other walks of life. My solution to sorting out this anomaly is that the husbands of dames and baronesses should be allowed to call themselves &#8220;honourables&#8221;&#8212;this is similar to the arrangements for children of peers&#8212;should they want to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/6">The honours system has evolved over the years. Although the Anglo-Saxon monarchs are known to have rewarded their loyal subjects with rings and other symbols of favour, it was the Normans who introduced knighthoods as part of their feudal government. The first English order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter, was created in 1348 by Edward III. Since then, the system has evolved to address the changing need to recognise other forms of service to the United Kingdom. Interestingly,</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/7">until the l7th century wives of knights were called dames, but that was replaced with the &#8220;Lady&#8221; prefix, which I suspect was introduced to avoid confusion. Until 2004, the adopted children of peers had no right to any courtesy title. Pursuant to a royal warrant dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase>, adopted children are now automatically entitled to the same styles and courtesy titles as their siblings. However, like biological children, they cannot inherit peerages from an adopting parent and so, as they cannot be heirs apparent, adopted sons may only use the styles of younger sons.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/8">I understand that although in the 19th century Scottish judges were allowed to use the honorary title &#8220;Lord&#8221; and would often take the name of their estates, their wives had to remain &#8220;Mrs&#8221; and would not be allowed to use the prefix &#8220;Lady&#8221;. On one occasion, a Scottish judge booked himself and his wife a double room in a Paris hotel and, when he signed in as &#8220;Lord and Mrs&#8221; whatever, the general manager of the hotel refused to take their booking because he thought that the judge was there with his mistress. He said he did not mind what happened in Britain, but such shenanigans were not going to be allowed in France. Very annoyed, the Scottish judge wrote to Queen Victoria, who pronounced that in future wives of Scottish judges should be allowed to call themselves &#8220;Lady&#8221;, thereby stopping any confusion.</p>
	<p pid="c.765.2/9">I ask this: if wives, children and adopted children of knights and peers are allowed to use their titles, why should dames&#8217; and baronesses&#8217; husbands be subject to such overt sexual discrimination? Similarly, surely we need to update the honours system for those who are in a civil partnership. That is why I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

The website states:</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/3">&#8220;Many of our customers choose to update their driving licence, credit cards and such like to reflect their new status.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/4">What a delight! I do not want to praise just one company; there is also <a href="http://www.lordtitles.co.uk">www.lordtitles.co.uk</a>. For &#163;18.95, or for an additional &#163;6.95 for a premium title, a person can get their own title. The website effectively guarantees that they will be</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/5">&#8220;offered the best seats in restaurants&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/6">and get</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/7">&#8220;airline upgrades and top-notch service.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/8">We know all that is true because the editor of <i>GQ</i>, Dylan Jones, who wrote an ironic, I hope, biography of the Prime Minister, which I am about to read now, wrote:</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/9">&#8220;At last my chance to lord it over you. Ladies and gentlemen, please grab your forelocks and give them a good old tug. Because I have just become a Lord of the Manor&#8230;the title I have was purchased from a website called lordtitles.co.uk&#8230;and I intend to lord it over everyone I know&#8230;I look forward to&#8230;flashing my credit card at impressionable waiters in New York and Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/10">This is all, of course, a pile of nonsense. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fact that in 2004 the Earl Marshal finally caught up with the fact that some peers had adopted children and allowed by warrant that they could use their courtesy titles but not inherit. That seems more scandalously unfair than anything else mentioned by him. It means that Andrew Tottenham, the adopted son of the Marquess of Ely, has to be called Lord Andrew Tottenham, not Viscount Loftus.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/11">I note that <i>Debrett&#8217;s</i>, which is where the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s speech seems to have come from, states:</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/12">&#8220;It is very important that anyone corresponding with a member of the peerage is aware of the rank and precedence of the person he or she is in contact with, so that the correct form of address may be used.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/13">To be honest, it is not important to my constituents in the Rhondda. We have only one person with a title that I am aware of living in the Rhondda, Baroness Gale of Blaenrhondda. She is from Blaenrhondda, and the people of Blaenrhondda love her, but she does not own Blaenrhondda as the titles were originally intended to denote.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/14">There is no need for legislation to change the courtesy titles&#8212;no need at all. These courtesy titles are no different from the fact that we call one another Mr, Mrs, Esquire, the Reverend or the Honourable. They are merely courtesy titles, and all we need to do, if we want to, is change our custom and practice. There is no need for legislation. The courtesy titles that have applied to the wives of people who have peerages, knighthoods or baronetcies have made sense only when those wives have chosen to take the name of their husband, so that, for instance, Mrs Prescott becomes Lady Prescott and Mrs Meale becomes Lady Meale.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/15">If I were ever to marry a woman&#8212;I know that is unlikely, but I very nearly got there a long, long time ago&#8212;I certainly would not be marrying the kind of woman who would want to take my name. Many women</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/16">today choose to keep their own name. Consequently, there is an additional layer of prejudice that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Bill would introduce against people who choose not to take their partner&#8217;s name. That applies to those who enter into civil partnerships as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/17">What the hon. Gentleman is suggesting would devalue those who get honours in their own right. For instance, take Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone. I have no idea why she is &#8220;of Nettlestone&#8221; because she was born in Dunoon, and Nettlestone is a place in the Isle of Wight, which is nowhere near the place where she was formerly a Member of Parliament. Her husband&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40674" name="Peter Bottomley">the hon. Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)</phrase>&#8212;was knighted in 2011. I am delighted that he is a knight of the realm but I think it is unfair that his knighthood should be eclipsed by his wife&#8217;s peerage and, therefore, the title that he would get as a courtesy title under the proposed Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/18">Similarly, I am delighted that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40365" name="Joan Ruddock">the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Dame Joan Ruddock)</phrase> is now a dame, but I hope very much that her husband, who is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40036" name="Frank Doran">the hon. Member for Aberdeen North (Mr Doran)</phrase>, will also at some point get a knighthood in his own right and not have to rely on a courtesy title.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/19">The custom is a relic of a bygone age when women were merely adjunct. In effect, they were referred to as the chattels, along with the household chattels, of a peer or a knight of the realm. I know that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport thinks his Bill will bring greater equality and that, for instance, for lesbian couples and gay couples, it will mean that they will suddenly be able to provide a courtesy title for their partner, but think of the complications likely to occur when Lord Alli&#8217;s partner is suddenly able to acquire a title which bears no relation to his own title. If the hon. Gentleman were going to do something for the LGBT community that would increase equality, he would be far better off supporting marriage equality than introducing this rather futile piece of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.766.0/20">Finally, if Conservative MPs have to rely on introducing ten-minute rule Bills of this kind, it seems to me that they are a party increasingly out of touch with the modern world.</p>

	<p pid="c.766.0/22" class="italic">Ordered,</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.770.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="770"  time="015:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0001.htm#12070396000550">
	<p pid="c.770.0/1">A number of VAT measures are to be debated today. To help the House, let me outline how I intend to deal with them. I will first address new clause 4, which relates to VAT on face-value vouchers, before turning to Government amendment 17 and new schedule 1, which address VAT anomalies. I am also conscious that a number of new clauses have been tabled by other right hon. and hon. Members, which I will respond to more fully later in the debate. I will also address amendments 18 to 20, which are consequential amendments dealing with VAT anomalies.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/2">New clause 4 is a Government change to protect revenue. It guards against the possibility of widespread VAT avoidance by the use of so-called single-purpose face-value vouchers. Because of the seriousness of the threat, I announced the change by way of a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-10">10 May</phrase>. Following a decision by the European Court of Justice in May, we need to amend our legislation as it relates to single-purpose face-value vouchers, such as phone cards, so that VAT is due when such vouchers are issued.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/3">We need to act with immediate effect to prevent a loophole due to the mismatch between the ECJ decision and current UK legislation. This could occur because individuals could argue that VAT cannot be collected on redemption by virtue of the Court&#8217;s decision, and it cannot be collected on issue by virtue of UK legislation. Therefore, the new clause protects around &#163;200 million of revenue a year and guards against avoidance that could otherwise run into hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/4">The changes made by new clause 4 will remove single-purpose face-value vouchers from the UK&#8217;s VAT regime. For face-value vouchers more generally, normal VAT rules will apply and they will be taxed when they are first sold. There is also a transitional rule to ensure the taxation of vouchers that were issued before <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-10">10 May</phrase> but used to pay for goods and services after that date, other than where that would lead to double taxation.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/5">It might be helpful to hon. Members if I provide a little background to the new clause. As I have said, the issue arose in connection with a recent decision of the European Court of Justice concerning the VAT treatment of cross-border supplies of single-purpose vouchers, in this case phone cards supplied by a business in the UK to customers in other member states. Most member states tax single-purpose vouchers when they are issued, but in the UK the issue is disregarded and VAT becomes due only when the vouchers are used to obtain the underlying goods or services. This treatment is welcomed by UK businesses, because it delays the point at which they have to account for VAT, so creating a cash-flow advantage and an absolute saving on those vouchers that are issued but never redeemed.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/6">However, in the case before the European Court of Justice, the business concerned complained that the difference in treatment between the UK and some other member states caused double taxation, because VAT was due in the member state where the card was sold to the final consumer and again in the UK when it was used to pay for telephone calls. The Court found against the UK&#8217;s approach in such a way that, until UK law was changed, suppliers of single-purpose face-value vouchers could have escaped VAT altogether. In the current market, that would have led to a tax loss of &#163;200 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/7">In addition, if UK law had not been changed there would have been the risk of widespread avoidance involving the use of single-purpose vouchers, which could have led to a significant loss of tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/8">To give an example, a car manufacturer could have issued a face-value voucher for a new car of &#163;15,000, which the customer could then redeem at his local dealership. UK law said that there was no tax on the issue of the voucher, and the Court of Justice of the European Union said that there was no supply at redemption and, therefore, no tax. That may be an extreme example, but it illustrates the problem that could arise in a variety of retail scenarios.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/9">The changes that new clause 4 make would remove single-purpose face-value vouchers from the UK&#8217;s VAT regime. For face-value vouchers more generally, this means that normal VAT rules will apply, and such vouchers will be taxed when first sold. There is also a transitional rule to ensure the taxation of vouchers that were issued before <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-10">10 May</phrase> but used to pay for goods or services after that date, other than when that would lead to double taxation, but the Court&#8217;s definition of what constitutes a single-purpose voucher allowed us to retain the UK&#8217;s treatment for most vouchers.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/10">The Court took the view that a single-purpose voucher is one that can be used to obtain goods or services of only one type, and which are subject to a single rate. Single-purpose face-value vouchers that are for one type of good or service form only a small proportion of the overall market for face-value vouchers, because most face-value vouchers can be exchanged for a range of goods or services. For example, a cinema voucher may be exchanged for tickets as well as for confectionary. Both the entry to see the film and the confectionary make suppliers liable to standard-rate VAT, but as they cannot be said to be of the same type the voucher is not caught by the judgment. We therefore expect the change to affect a relatively small number of businesses, and I hope that that explanation is helpful to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/11">In conclusion on face-value vouchers, the new clause is a proportionate response to the significant risk of tax loss arising from the use of single-purpose vouchers. It is carefully targeted against the risks and retains the VAT treatment for the great majority of vouchers sold in this country, and I commend it to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/12">Amendment 17 and new schedule 1 relate to the categorisation of suppliers for the purposes of value added tax. New schedule 1 would implement the changes announced at the Budget, which have been refined in the light of consultation, to address anomalies and loopholes in the area of VAT liability. The VAT system contains a number of anomalies along the borderlines of VAT exemptions and VAT zero rates, and addressing some of those anomalies and loopholes is precisely what the Chancellor announced at the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/13">The Government announced at the Budget that they were introducing a number of measures to address some of those VAT anomalies, reducing uncertainty, costs for business and for HMRC, and raising revenue. On Budget day, we proposed a number of measures and launched a consultation to engage stakeholders and to listen to their ideas. The measures that we announced proposed to clarify the treatment of catering to ensure</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/14">that all hot takeaway food is taxed, and to clarify the meaning of &#8220;premises&#8221; in the context of whether food is consumed on or off a supplier&#8217;s premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.770.0/15">We proposed also to tax sports nutrition drinks to ensure that all sports drinks receive the same tax treatment, and to remove self-storage from exemption in order to ensure that all suppliers of storage receive the same tax treatment and to counter avoidance.</p>

	<p pid="c.772.1/1">I certainly will, although at this point I am just setting out what we set out at the Budget. I will turn to each individual measure in more detail in a moment and happily give way to my hon. Friend at that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.772.1/2">We propose to remove the anomaly whereby approved alterations to certain listed buildings are zero-rated while alterations to other buildings and repairs to and maintenance on all buildings are standard-rated. We included transitional arrangements for alteration works to listed buildings which had been contracted before the Budget, and we wanted to put beyond doubt the fact that VAT applies to the rental of hairdressers&#8217; chairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.772.1/3">Finally, we proposed to ensure that holiday caravans are taxed consistently at the standard rate of VAT. The proposal, as set out in the consultation document, was that all the changes would take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-01">1 October</phrase> via secondary legislation, supported by anti-forestalling provisions in this Bill. The consultation was opened on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-21">21 March</phrase>, and overall HMRC received some 1,500 responses. Owing to the volume of interest in the consultation, we decided to extend it, and since it has closed we have reflected fully on the points made during the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.772.1/4">As the House will be aware, in two areas&#8212;hot food that is cooling down naturally and static holiday caravans&#8212;the Budget proposals created a high degree of business uncertainty, so the Government wanted to let people know our preferred course of action as soon as possible; we did that on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-28">28 May</phrase>. Last Thursday, we published a consultation response document and tabled the new schedule setting out our approach to all the measures on which we consulted. We stand by the rationale for removing anomalies, but have made several refinements, including those we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-28">28 May</phrase>. They are intended to improve the policy and reflect the practical concerns raised in the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.772.2/1">HMRC produced a document on the impact of the caravan tax, but can the Minister provide enlightenment on the impact of the 5% VAT imposition? There are no figures now on how many jobs will be lost and by how much demand for static caravans will decrease, and I was hoping that the Treasury had worked that out.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.772.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="772"  time="015:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0001.htm#12070396000554">
	<p pid="c.772.3/1">Clearly there is a substantial difference between 20% VAT and 5% VAT. We set out our estimates in relation to the 20% rate, and some of the concerns that people took from what HMRC set out were, I think, somewhat greater than the reality warranted, because the impact set out and the assumption regarding the reduction in demand related solely to that element to which the change from zero-rated to standard-rated</p>
	<p pid="c.772.3/2">applied. On many caravans that are sold, the VAT is recovered&#8212;VAT already applies to an element of the price of a static caravan: that of the fixtures and fittings.</p>
	<p pid="c.772.3/3">We do not think the impact of the 5% rate is likely to be substantial. In the usual course of business there are tax changes&#8212;national insurance contributions and rates are the subject of regular fluctuations&#8212;and in many cases the VAT change may well be absorbed. In addition, we have given industry much more time by deciding not to implement the change until April next year. Caravan manufacturers will have the opportunity to sell more caravans in advance of next year&#8217;s summer season&#8212;the information we have is that spring tends to be the busiest period. The overall impact on the industry is therefore unlikely to be significant.</p>
	<p pid="c.772.3/4">Before discussing each of the anomalies and saying more about static caravans, I would like to give the House a little bit of history about the VAT system. As I am sure all hon. Members know, the VAT system was introduced in 1973 and amendments and adjustments were being made as early as 1974. The then Labour Government added confectionary, soft drinks, ice cream, potato crisps and certain other savoury snacks&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.773.1/1">I certainly will, Mr Speaker. I did say I would give a little history and, following your guidance, I will focus on the little.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/2">I hope it helps the House if I explain that, in the almost 40 years in which we have had VAT, there have been changes from time to time. There were changes in the VAT on building alterations in 1982 and 1984, on hot takeaway food in 1984 and on newspaper and magazine advertising in 1985&#8212;I could go on, Mr Speaker, but let me move on.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/3">I am sure that hon. Members are conscious of the ongoing debates on whether a Jaffa cake is a cake or a biscuit. It is a regular pub quiz question, Mr Speaker; I am almost tempted to try it on you this afternoon. There was a question on a Radio 4 quiz about the amount of potato in a Pringle. I highlight those points because there are complexities and anomalies in the tax system and addressing that is the purpose behind the new schedule and the policy behind the announcements in the Budget, not the least of which related to hot food. It is fair to say that the current rules on the VAT liability of hot takeaway food have been made complex and unfair by a patchwork of different legal decisions over the decades, which is very much what we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/4">VAT has always applied to food consumed on the supplier&#8217;s premises, notably in restaurants and caf&#233;s, and it was extended to hot takeaway food in 1984. The definition of &#8220;hot takeaway food&#8221; in the 1984 legislation is that the food</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/5">&#8220;has been heated for the purposes of enabling it to be consumed at a temperature above ambient air temperature; and&#8230;is above that temperature at the time it is provided to the customer.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/6">There have been repeated efforts since the 1980s to chip away at that boundary. A number of businesses have argued in litigation that although the food that they provide to their customers is hot and is taken away, it should not be taxed as hot takeaway food but should be zero-rated.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/7">Some have successfully argued that the purpose in heating the food was not to provide their customers with food to be eaten hot and that they heated their food for other purposes&#8212;for example, for hygiene reasons, to finish the cooking process, to provide evidence of freshness, to create an aroma or to improve appearance, crispiness or texture. Those arguments have not always been successful, but when they have been they have allowed some businesses to secure zero rating for a range of hot food products such as hot rotisserie chickens, meat pies, pasties and panini.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/8">However, other businesses have continued to apply VAT to the similar hot food products that they sell. They have accepted, or the courts have ruled, that their purpose in heating hot food products is so that the customers can eat them hot. Under the current rules, a small independent fish and chip shop will have to charge VAT on its hot chicken and hot pies, but a major supermarket will argue that its rotisserie chickens or heated pies are zero-rated.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/9">The current rules mean that many customers simply do not know whether they are being charged VAT on their hot food, because the treatment currently depends on a particular supplier&#8217;s purpose in heating the food, and identical products can have different VAT treatment. The new rules that we are introducing in new schedule 1 will ensure a level playing field. The taxation of hot food will be the same whether the supplier has used a hot cabinet to keep food hot so that it can be eaten hot or to ensure enticing aromas.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/10">During the consultation, many concerns were expressed about bakery products such as Cornish pasties, which are not kept hot after being cooked but are left to cool down naturally. As those products are sold while they are cooling down naturally, under the changes as originally announced their VAT liability would change when they reached ambient temperature and were no longer hot. As has been previously announced, we accepted that the implied requirement to test the temperature of such products at the point of sale could cause practical difficulties, so the revised legislation takes a slightly different approach to creating the level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="c.773.1/11">The new definition of &#8220;hot food&#8221; retains the condition that the food is hot when provided to the customer. It also retains the current criterion of the supplier&#8217;s purpose in heating the food, but adds a number of other criteria to define other circumstances in which hot food will be standard-rated. Those additional criteria are that the food is either heated to order, kept hot after being heated, sold in special heat-retaining packaging or other packaging specifically designed for hot food, or advertised or marketed as hot.</p>

	<p pid="c.774.0/1">My hon. Friend refers to the marketing of such things as sold hot. Will he confirm that a baker who markets something as freshly baked would not fall foul of this provision, given that presumably when something is freshly baked it is hot? I think that the intention is that, say, a freshly baked sausage roll that is</p>
	<p pid="c.774.0/2">cooling down would not be subject to VAT, but if that marketing term were used it could perhaps be caught by the provision.</p>

	<p pid="c.775.1/1">I am tempted to ask my hon. Friend whether he knows how many different chocolate eyes a gingerbread man must have to go from being zero-rated to standard-rated. The answer is on HMRC&#8217;s website.</p>
	<p pid="c.775.1/2">On packaging, new schedule 1 uses the wording:</p>
	<p pid="c.775.1/3">&#8220;whether or not the packaging was primarily designed for that purpose&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.775.1/4">There is some ambiguity as to whether a simple paper bag might be caught by that definition. Can the Minister assure us that people will be able to get their pies and pasties in a paper bag from the bakery without their being standard-rated?</p>

	<p pid="c.775.2/1">The purpose of that wording relates to packaging that is specifically designed for the retention of heat. For example, hon. Members will all have experience of a paper bag with a foil interior that is used for such purposes. I do not think that a simple paper bag would fall into that category. In most people&#8217;s experience, pasties and suchlike are generally left on shelves rather than contained within bags while in the shop. I hope that that provides some clarification.</p>

	<p pid="c.775.3/1">We have arrived at this change after 20-odd years in which, through various legal challenges, we have come to our current conclusions on this aspect of VAT.

	<p pid="c.775.4/1">One can never rule out the fact that some people will be litigious and try to take a creative view of any particular guidance. However, we believe that we have reached the right position after much consultation and discussion with the industry and with hon. Members, many of whom have been very engaged in the matter. I look around the House and see at least two Members who have been in my office to make representations on this point. We believe that we have reached a position that is sustainable and fair, and that is what we are putting to the House in the new schedule. The additional criteria will ensure that hot food will generally be taxed at the standard rate of VAT, but if food that would be zero-rated when cold is bought when it happens to be cooling down, but is not yet cold, it will still be zero-rated provided that it does not meet any of the criteria that I set out. These changes will add further tests to make the relief less open to abuse and provide a level playing field for all businesses supplying their customers with hot food.</p>
	<p pid="c.775.4/2">Turning to the issue of holiday caravans, which we have touched on briefly, the VAT zero rate was originally intended to apply to the sale of caravans used only for residential purposes. To achieve that objective, the rules drawn up in the 1970s applied tax only to the sale of smaller caravans that could legally be towed on UK roads by a typical family car. However, over the years, an increasing number of large caravans have been used for holiday purposes. Those caravans inadvertently benefit from the VAT zero rate that was intended for residential caravans. That has led to widespread inconsistency in the VAT treatment of the sale of holiday caravans.</p>
	<p pid="c.775.4/3">Under the current legislation, any caravan wider than 2.55 metres or longer than 7 metres is zero-rated as a residential caravan. The Government propose to replace the definition of a zero-rated caravan based on size with a new definition based on whether the caravan has been designed for residential use. To achieve that, we propose a new test that links the zero-rating with British Standard 3632, which indicates that the caravan has been designed and manufactured for continuous, all-year-round occupation and is therefore suitable for residential accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.775.4/4">We consulted on whether the additional criteria should be added to ensure that the zero rate applies only to caravans intended for residential use. Given the reaction to the proposal, we decided that rather than having a single dividing line between a zero rate of VAT on residential caravans and a rate of 20% on static holiday caravans, static holiday caravans should be subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 5%. Static residential caravans&#8212;those that meet BS 3632, or early equivalents in the case of second-hand sales of older caravans&#8212;will remain zero-rated, as per the Budget proposal. We do not intend to restrict the zero rate further by adding additional criteria.</p>

	<p pid="c.776.3/1">In this particular circumstance, the manufacturing standard provides a better definition or borderline than the size criteria that I set out. It was put to us in the consultation that it would be very easy for manufacturers to do a bit more here and there, and that a static caravan that was once not BS 3632-compliant suddenly would be. When we investigated that, we concluded that it was quite expensive and difficult to meet BS 3632. Genuine residential caravans meet that standard, but non-residential, holiday vans do not. It seems to be an effective borderline. Of course these matters will be kept under review, but we think that this is a sensible conclusion and one that the industry recognises. The evidence that the industry has put to us is that BS 3632 adequately distinguishes between residential caravans and static caravans.</p>
	<p pid="c.776.3/2">It is worth pointing out that BS 3632 caravans tend to be more expensive and are built to a higher specification. For those reasons, they tend to be used more in the residential market than in the holiday market. It is worth coming back to the intention of the 1970s definition for zero-rated caravans.</p>
	<p pid="c.776.3/3">We recognise that static holiday caravans fall in a grey area between residential property and temporary holiday accommodation, which have different tax regimes. We have therefore produced the fair compromise of a 5% VAT rate. The argument was sometimes made to us that static holiday caravans should be treated like a second home, on which VAT is not paid. However, council tax is paid on a second home, which is not the case with static holiday caravans. Imposing the council tax regime on static caravan homes would have placed a significant burden on their owners and holiday parks, so we believe that we have made a fair compromise. As I said earlier, to give the industry more time to adjust, the measure will be delayed until <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-06">6 April 2013</phrase>. All the other measures that we are discussing today will proceed as planned on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-01">1 October</phrase> this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.777.1/1">We assessed what the impact would be if VAT was at 20%, and obviously 5% is a quarter of that, so one can draw correlations. Most industries supply VAT-inclusive durable goods at a profit, so it is reasonable to apply VAT in this case. The impact that we originally set out in the tax information and impact note at the time of the Budget will be significantly lessened by the change to the 5% rate, particularly bearing in mind that there is already a full 20% rate on a fair proportion of static caravans because of the durable goods contained within them.</p>

	<p pid="c.777.2/1">We can partly assess what the impact will be from what manufacturers themselves have said, which is that they do not expect the 5% rate to have an impact of any great severity on them. However, it is important to recognise that there needs to be stability, so an assurance that the Government will not raise the rate in future would be welcome, as would an undertaking that there will be an assessment of the rate after a year or two to see whether it has had any impact. Generally, the industry has welcomed it.</p>

I am sure my hon. Friend will be pleased about that. Were we to do so, I have no doubt that he would make strong representations once again. I hope he will take some comfort from that.</p>

	<p pid="c.778.0/1">The National Caravan Council has said that the caravan industry is fragile after the problems that it experienced in 2008. Based on the figures in the KPMG report, there would have been 6,000 job losses if the imposition of the 20% rate had gone ahead.

	<p pid="c.778.1/1">Perhaps it will help the hon. Lady if I run through the situation. We have to raise a certain number of taxes, and VAT probably does less harm to the economy than almost any other tax that one could mention, whether it be employers&#8217; national insurance contributions, which reduce the number of jobs, or corporation tax, which reduces investment. There is an issue with any tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.778.1/2">On this particular policy, however, we are talking about a 5% rate on 80% of the price of a caravan, the other 20% being standard rated already, and on 85% of sales, the other 15% being standard rated already&#8212;or rather the purchaser being able to recover input taxes on it. There is then an elasticity of demand, and the 5% rate might result in a 5% reduction in demand, but of course that involves various assumptions and some uncertainty. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> said, however, much of the industry does not think it will have a significant impact.</p>

	<p pid="c.778.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Tax is but one of the various factors that will have an impact on demand, and VAT is but one tax. I shall not dwell on it, Mr Speaker, but I should mention that the Government are putting in place a much more competitive corporation tax regime, which will be to the advantage of caravan manufacturers and many others.</p>
	<p pid="c.778.3/2">I shall touch briefly on alterations to listed buildings. The reaction to our announced changes to VAT on approved alterations to listed buildings demonstrated the need for the measure on the grounds of simplification alone. The consultation and media coverage has highlighted the huge uncertainty over whether an item of building work is an alteration or a repair. The purpose of the measure is to avoid the need for such discussions by applying the same VAT liability to all alterations, repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance to all buildings, including listed buildings, have always been liable to VAT, and alterations to non-listed buildings have been since 1984. The Budget announcement changes none of that, although a zero rate currently applies to alterations to protected buildings&#8212;mostly listed dwellings but also scheduled monuments and listed buildings used for charitable and other residential purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.778.3/3">For listed buildings, the borderline between alteration and repair or maintenance is a major source of confusion. The Budget announcement has no impact on the repair and maintenance of listed buildings, which have always</p>
	<p pid="c.778.3/4">been liable to VAT, so there will be no change to the VAT treatment of repairs to thatched roofs or steeples, contrary to what has been reported in the press. The Budget decision also reflects our view that grants can provide a more flexible mechanism than VAT for providing specific financial support for the heritage sector. We have increased the funding for the listed places of worship scheme and broadened its scope so that churches and other listed places of worship can claim grants to offset the impact of VAT on their alterations, repairs and maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.778.3/5">The Budget proposal for alterations to listed buildings includes transitional arrangements, and, following the consultation, we have decided to make these more generous. As with the Budget proposal, the transitional arrangements will cover cases where written contracts had been entered into before Budget day 2012 or, in the case of the first grant of buildings that have been substantially reconstructed, where 10% of the work had been completed before Budget day. We have now agreed that they should also apply where listed building consent had been applied for before the Budget, and the transitional arrangements will be extended so that, where a project qualifies, zero rating can apply until <phrase class="date" code="2015-09-30">30 September 2015</phrase>. These extensions will mean that the zero rate will continue to apply for most alteration projects where work was close to starting at the time of the Budget announcement.</p>

	<p pid="c.779.0/1">I apologise for interrupting the Minister&#8217;s flow, but I want to take him back to listed buildings. He spoke about grants being available to churches for alterations and repairs.

Will he clarify what the position will be?</p>

	<p pid="c.779.1/1">The first point to make is that the increased funding for the listed places of worship scheme was entered into after consultation with the Church of England, which led for other religious groups in this matter, and I understand that they are satisfied with the arrangements that have been reached. The listed places of worship scheme, which the previous Government set up, has been extended to allow recovery costs relating to VAT for both repairs and alterations. It offers church groups, for example, an opportunity to recover the costs they would otherwise incur, but is now much more generously funded, and a much greater proportion of VAT costs will be able to be reclaimed. Indeed, VAT costs should be able to be reclaimed in full for the time being, such is the scale of the support we have made available for the listed places of worship scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.779.1/2">It is perhaps worth pointing out that we always made it clear that we would increase the listed places of worship scheme, because of the increased costs that were going to be placed on churches, but after further discussions, with the Church of England in particular, we realised that the amount we had initially said would be adequate was not adequate, and we increased it. However, to deal with the hon. Lady&#8217;s specific question,</p>
	<p pid="c.779.1/3">what is proposed is indeed a reclaim arrangement. That is how it will work, and that is how it worked in the last Parliament as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.780.1/1">I understand the point the hon. Lady raises. The Church is satisfied with the arrangements. She is suggesting that in order to fund a project, a church group would need to fund the cost, plus 20%. That is not how it should work, because the scheme will be sufficiently flexible to ensure that a church group will have the funding in time, so that it does not have to raise an additional 20% or so. I have had considerable conversations with Church representatives on this issue, and I am not getting representations that they are concerned about that point.</p>

	<p pid="c.780.3/1">The advantage of the way in which we have introduced this measure&#8212;through the listed places of worship scheme&#8212;is that there is already a mechanism in place for providing grants for repairs. That is something we inherited, and although I cannot say this about everything we inherited, it is quite helpful. We anticipate that there will be a monthly repayment process through the listed places of worship scheme. With regard to the hon. Lady&#8217;s concern about cash flow, the main point to make is that the Church is content with the arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.780.4/1">I thank the Minister for his clarification on that matter. I understand that if churches want to reclaim VAT in such circumstances, such a claim will have to apply to work on the footprint of the original construction. When work is done not only to the old part of the church but also to the new, will it be possible to differentiate a claim so that the work done on the old part and that carried out on the new extension can be treated differently?</p>

	<p pid="c.780.5/1">The arrangements that will be in place following the legislation will mean that repairs and alterations will be chargeable for VAT. However, the listed places of worship scheme will apply to both types of work. It has been the case for some time that repairs involved the payment of VAT. The listed places of worship scheme will enable people to reclaim the VAT costs relating to those repairs. An extension&#8212;which is an alteration, rather than a repair&#8212;will now have VAT charged to it, but it will be possible to reclaim it through that same scheme. The scheme is now more generously funded than it was before the Budget, which means that a higher proportion of the costs that the churches</p>
	<p pid="c.780.5/2">would have incurred will now be able to be reclaimed. We have taken steps that the churches have widely welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="c.781.0/1">I am sorry to have missed the beginning of the Minister&#8217;s remarks on this subject. I was actually checking up on certain aspects of a similar issue in my constituency. He said that the Church of England was content with the arrangements, but I hope that he will accept that it is not just the Church of England that is involved. I have a lot of churches, places of worship and listed buildings in my constituency, and I have been contacted by a church that was in the advanced stages of preparing to carry out work that could be seriously affected by the proposals. Will the Minister guarantee that, if the funding for the scheme does not meet the requirements, he will look again at the level of funding provided? Will he also monitor the scheme closely to ensure that no extra bureaucracy is introduced that could delay projects that would otherwise go ahead?</p>

	<p pid="c.781.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that not just the Church of England is involved. I said earlier, however, that the Church of England had led on behalf of all the churches on this matter. On his second point, we have made the transitional rules more generous for churches that were close to commencing work at the time of the Budget. I obviously cannot comment on the specific case in his constituency without knowing all the details, but I think that he will find that many cases in which plans had reached an advanced stage will benefit from the transitional rules. He mentioned the funding for the scheme. We believe that this is a generous settlement, but we will of course keep such matters under review. He also mentioned bureaucracy. The scheme is organised by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but the Treasury will also take a close interest in it. The two Departments have worked together very effectively on this matter, and we are keen to ensure that the scheme works in an adequate way. I would underline the point that the representations that we have received from the churches suggest that they are happy with the arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.781.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman is attempting to draw me into dangerous, and perhaps more interesting, territory. All I would say to him is that all decisions are for the Chancellor, although of course the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was involved at an appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid="c.781.3/2">The Budget proposal for self-storage changed the liability of supplies of facilities for self-storage from exempt to taxable. Following consultation, we planned to avoid creating a competitive advantage for those larger operators with more expensive facilities. These businesses can partially mitigate the impact of the change by using the capital goods scheme to claim back some of the VAT they had previously paid on the purchase of these facilities, whereas smaller businesses with less expensive</p>
	<p pid="c.781.3/3">facilities cannot. We will therefore make a separate provision by statutory instrument to amend the capital goods scheme so that self-storage providers affected by the measure whose individual capital items are worth less than a &#163;250,000 threshold for the scheme can opt into it and have the same input tax recovery benefits as larger providers with capital items that would already qualify for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.781.3/4">We also propose to ensure that the storage of live animals will remain exempt, as the original proposal might inadvertently have applied VAT to stabling, and we propose to introduce an anti-avoidance provision so that if the storage is used by a third party with the permission of the person who contracts for the storage, it is taxed in the same way as if it were self-storage. This will prevent someone from avoiding taxation by getting a third party to contract with the supplier. We have revised the exclusion for storage facilities provided to persons connected with the supplier so that it is more directly targeted on facilities that are subject to the capital goods scheme. This fine-tuning reflects the benefit of consulting and listening to what respondents say, but it is does not undermine the rationale for the measure.</p>
	<p pid="c.781.3/5">For hairdressers&#8217; chairs, the schedule provides a clearer description of the services typically provided under a chair rental agreement and excludes services that could legitimately be provided with a simple supply of a right over land. The schedule also reflects a change to make it clear that the supply of a whole building to a hairdresser will not become taxable unless it is supplied along with other goods or services.</p>
	<p pid="c.781.3/6">Finally, regarding the measure to apply VAT to all sports drinks and to clarify the definition of premises for the purposes of determining whether food is consumed on or off the suppliers&#8217; premises, we are proceeding as planned in the Budget.</p>

Typical sports drinks which are consumed primarily to rehydrate or quench thirst are already taxed accordingly at the standard rate, but some sports drinks companies have won court rulings that their products are not beverages because of their nutritional content and because they are not designed to quench thirst. The changes that we are introducing will ensure that all sports drinks are subject to the same VAT treatment whether they are consumed</p>

There is a clear distinction between them, as one is more closely aligned to food than to sports drinks.</p>
	<p pid="c.784.1/2">New schedule 1 will remove some of the anomalies in our VAT system. It will raise revenue and reduce the administrative burden on HMRC and businesses.

As a consequence, schedule 26, introducing the anti-forestalling provisions for self-storage and approved alterations to listed buildings, needs to be amended by amendments 18 to 20 so that it refers to the changes being made in the new schedule. I commend these consequential amendments to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.784.1/4">I have spoken for over an hour&#8212;doesn&#8217;t time fly when one&#8217;s having fun, Mr Speaker! I hope I have given a helpful introduction to the debate, setting out some of the details to the House, and I hope these proposed provisions will be added to the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.784.3/1">I will speak to new clauses 10 and 12, as well as the Government amendments that the Minister has already set out for us in quite some detail today.</p>
	<p pid="c.784.3/2">The Opposition&#8217;s new clause 10 seeks to put a stop to the chaotic farce of ill-thought-through VAT changes being slapped on items from the pasty to the caravan, from haircuts to church alterations&#8212;imposed, defended, downgraded and then, in some cases, eventually quietly removed by Ministers during the parliamentary recess, once they realised quite how ridiculous the changes were to begin with, particularly given the current economic climate. We simply ask the Government not to meddle</p>
	<p pid="c.784.3/3">with VAT exemptions until they have carried out a proper assessment and worked out exactly what the impact of any change would be on jobs, living standards and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.784.3/4">We assume that, before imposing a 20% tax, the Government will do their sums, work out who would be affected, consult them and think long and hard about whether such a change was a good idea. Our new clause 12 seeks to reverse the VAT bombshell, which, as I am sure many Members will recall, the Liberal Democrats shouted so loudly about before the election, and before they all subsequently discovered that they actually supported raising the 20% rate after all. That was a surprise all around, even to themselves, I think. In fact, everyone&#8217;s surprise about that was surpassed only by the discovery that the Liberal Democrats had also been in favour of &#163;9,000 tuition fees all along.</p>
	<p pid="c.784.3/5">Labour is clear that higher VAT hits the poor harder than the rich. It drives up the cost of living at a time when people are already feeling the squeeze, and it takes money out of people&#8217;s pockets and off the high street at a time when businesses are crying out for spending to drive growth. Our five-point plan for jobs and growth calls for VAT to return to 17.5% on a temporary basis until the economy is strong enough to cope with a rise. That would give &#163;450 a year back to couples with children, to give the economy a boost and to drive growth.</p>

If he were able to do that, we could certainly provide detailed costings of our tax proposal. The point is that the reduction to 17.5% will put money back into people&#8217;s pockets, get the economy moving and get growth back into the economy. That will help to bring down borrowing, which is increasing at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="c.786.3/1">I repeat what I said before: the Government&#8217;s current policy of increasing VAT to 20% is taking money out of people&#8217;s pockets and is causing a slump in demand.

	<p pid="c.786.7/1">Clearly, a family would gain more from a VAT cut because they spend much more on VAT as a proportion of their household income. The hon.

	<p pid="c.787.4/1">I could probably answer the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question with just four words: &#8220;out of double-dip recession.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/2">The Government&#8217;s economic credibility, not to mention any reputation for competence they might have had, has taken a massive hit over the VAT changes. They put VAT on pasties and took it away. They put VAT on caravans, then they reduced it to 5%. They put VAT on churches and kept it. Then they invited payment of the charge up front. Churches could claim it back by submitting forms to the Treasury for access to a special fund, which essentially is a big pot of all the money that they paid up front in the first place. What a shambles. Do the Government even know what they are doing any more? They say that their U-turns show that they are listening. When they got it so horrendously wrong, it is good that campaigners were able to get through to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/3">I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House have worked hard to get the Government to listen on the subject of the VAT changes, but is it not all</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/4">too serious to be left to second chances? Do not the people of this country deserve a Government who can get it right first time? People saw in the Budget a true reflection of a Chancellor who tried to sneak through thoughtless changes and got found out.</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/5">Let us look at some of the Government&#8217;s tax changes. The selection speaks volumes about this Government. They gave a tax cut to banks and to millionaires, but showed no mercy to people who eat pasties. The pasty tax will go down in history as one of the most incompetent Government debacles ever. The attempt to raise the price of pasties and sausage rolls by 20% was claimed to be necessary to close an anomaly, but was universally seen as evidence of an out-of-touch Government trying their luck and grabbing tax on a food that Ministers never eat. The Save Our Savouries campaign run by <i>The Sun</i> pointed out that caviar is still VAT-exempt. Perhaps we can learn something from that. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that in his concluding remarks.</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/6">The Prime Minister told us:</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/7">&#8220;I&#8217;m a pasty eater myself. . . I love a hot pasty&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.787.4/8">but he gave himself away when he said that his last pasty was from a shop that turned out not to exist. It was just one gaffe after another. The Chancellor ended up giving evidence to the Treasury Committee on how to tell whether a pasty was hot or cold. Members pointed out that because products would be subject to VAT if they were above ambient temperature when bought, pasties could cost different amounts on summer and winter days.</p>

	<p pid="c.788.1/1">Our position is that we would like none of the VAT changes to be introduced so by voting against new schedule 1 today, as I have already explained, we vote against all the VAT changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/2">As was pointed out, if the pasty counter was near the oven, the ambient temperature would be higher. If it was near the chiller, the ambient temperature may be lower. Greggs&#8217; official consultation document asked whether servers would ultimately have to take the temperature of both the pasty and the surrounding air to determine whether a 20% surcharge should be applied. The proposal was universally and rightly rounded on as ridiculous. Ken McMeikan, the chief executive of Greggs the bakers, which I am proud to say is based in my part of the world, Tyne and Wear, deserves a mention for his excellent campaign against the pasty tax. A massive &#163;30 million was wiped off the value of the company in the week after the Budget as orders were threatened and jobs put at risk. Along with several hundred other bakers, Mr McMeikan delivered a petition to 10 Downing street. He told Ministers:</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/3">&#8220;we are the voice of half a million people. We embody their resentment at what this Government is trying to impose against the people&#8217;s will. . . ordinary hard working people simply do not want this pasty tax.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/4">I visited a local school breakfast club with Mr McMeikan and I know just how committed Greggs is to local schools and community projects. It did not deserve to</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/5">have its business torpedoed by Ministers who are too out of touch ever to have eaten one of its products. Eventually the Government backed down on the pasty tax&#8212;they had to because that was the only move they could make&#8212;but they left behind them a legacy of arrogant disregard for ordinary people that will not quickly be forgotten. My only hope now is that the U-turn that has been made will be made properly. Representatives of Greggs are still raising concerns that the new wording of the regulations on hot food now state that VAT should be charged if it</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/6">&#8220;is provided&#8230;in packaging that retains heat (whether or not the packaging was primarily designed for that purpose)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">The hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase> raised the matter with the Minister, but his answer did not provide certainty, so I would be grateful if he would clarify in his reply exactly how the Government will ensure certainty for this slightly battered production market.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/8">Any sort of paper bag or wrapping could inadvertently help to retain heat, so there is a danger that pasties could still be caught in the regulations and that this whole incompetent mess of U-turns and retractions will all have been for nothing. I hope that the Government will take the opportunity to clarify that point and reassure Greggs and other bakers up and down the country that supplying customers with paper napkins, for example, which could inadvertently slow down the cooling process, will not result in an extra 20% charge for their customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/9">Greggs would like confirmation, as I am sure would other bakers across the country, on whether taking trays of baked products from the oven and stacking them in counters that have no other means of heating or heat retention would be considered to be slowing down the cooling process. The practice is used by bakers to minimise food handling and the number of trays in use, but there are genuine concerns in the industry that it could constitute slowing down the cooling process and so incur a VAT charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/10">The Government&#8217;s second U-turn was on their attempt to charge 20% VAT on static caravans&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am asked from a sedentary position &#8220;Are you only on the second U-turn?&#8221; Yes, I am. I venture to guess that caravan holidays, like pasties, are not familiar to most members of the Cabinet. They saw an opportunity to take some extra tax and went ahead without considering the impact on individuals, jobs, growth or tourism. Because of the huge campaign mounted against the policy&#8212;I pay tribute to Members on both sides of the House for that, particularly hon. Members who represent the Hull constituencies, who are particularly concerned about the impact on jobs in their area&#8212;the Government backed down, but they are still trying to impose the 5% charge, as the Minister set out in more detail earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/11">The Treasury&#8217;s own figures show that 20% VAT on static caravans would result in a 30% fall in demand. The industry estimates that it would result in 1,000 job losses in manufacturing, excluding the supply chain. We know that at least one factory in the supply chain, Willerby Holiday Homes, put all 700 of its staff on a 90-day consultation as a direct result of the Government&#8217;s announcement that it would levy 20% VAT on its product. The National Caravan Council states that 4,300 jobs might be lost in holiday parks, plus another 1,500 jobs from associated suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="c.788.1/12">I appreciate that the Minister has sought to give some reassurances on the change and indicated that the Government are listening, to the extent of reducing the VAT rate to 5%. However, he has made it clear today that no actual calculation has been made on the potential impact of the 5% charge, which is of great concern. Even the reduced charge of 5% will mean either that caravan holidays will become more expensive for holidaymakers or that holiday parks will be forced to absorb losses and job cuts. At a time when consumers are already severely squeezed, many people will simply have to go elsewhere. In turn, the whole economy of holiday towns would be hit, with shops, pubs and attractions losing their main business. Is that really what the Government intended?</p>

That is the highest figure in the UK, and any job losses are going to be very difficult for my constituents, so that is why I am pressing the Minister to be very clear about the number of job losses that the 5% imposition will bring about.

The Minister in his opening remarks confirmed that no assessment has been made of the impact of the 5% increase on the industry, and that is gravely concerning, because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon.

	<p pid="c.790.8/2">suggested, the industry needs certainty, security and stability to create the jobs that my hon. Friend is so concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="c.790.8/3">The fact that the proposal is being put in place without a proper assessment of what is a lesser impact but still one of 5% is deeply concerning, because the last thing the industry needs is for the measure to be reviewed 12 months down the line, be seen to have had a detrimental impact, and for it to have to go through the whole process all over again.</p>

In Great Yarmouth, I represent a &#163;500-million-a-year tourism industry, with about 50% of our bed space in static caravans. Our industry was concerned, but its message to me is that it thinks the 5% rate is not only fair, but better than it had hoped for.</p>
	<p pid="c.791.0/2">The industry understands the arguments that everyone has to do their bit and that there has been an anomaly for a long time, and feels that the measure is manageable, will not have an impact on its business and is fair. We are very pleased, in fact, that we finally have a Government who say that they will consult and listen, do so and come back with exactly what the industry wants.</p>

	<p pid="c.791.1/1">The only point I can make is that the industry suffered the serious blow of having a 20% tax announced. That has been reduced to 5%, which it will obviously welcome, but we propose to remove the VAT changes altogether, because at this particular time the last thing that any industry needs, but particularly the holiday, static caravan and manufacturing industries, is a VAT hike. We need to invest in jobs and growth to get the economy moving, to get out of the double-dip recession that we are in and to get back into growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.792.0/1">I made that very point when I expressed surprise at the impression being given that the static caravan industry warmly embraces and welcomes the change. A more rational description is that the industry accepts it as a much better deal than the one they were originally given by the Government&#8212;a slapped-on VAT increase to 20%, which would certainly have had an impact on jobs and compounded the lack of growth in the economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/2">Once again, the change was announced during a parliamentary recess, the same day as the U-turn on the dreaded pasty tax. As Parliament was not sitting, there was no opportunity for the House to scrutinise the details of the Government&#8217;s plan&#8212;details such as where the money to pay for the change of heart would come from. The Government have yet to provide an answer to that question. We know the money will come from &#8220;underspends&#8221; in unidentified Departments, but we do not know where those underspends have occurred, whether they were planned, or why the coalition&#8217;s No. 1 priority of deficit reduction is no longer the default destination. The two measures&#8212;pasties and caravans&#8212;were supposed to raise &#163;70 million, which is now unaccounted for. I hope that someone somewhere knows how to make up those sums. Many ordinary people consider &#163;70 million quite a big hole to fill. How do Government plan to deal with it?</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/3">The third U-turn is the Government&#8217;s partial reversal on the so-called church tax. Ministers claimed that, in future, VAT would be payable on alterations to listed buildings, which are currently exempt. Of course, as the Government acknowledged today, half the listed buildings in this country are owned by the Church of England, which pointed out immediately that the change would cost it at least &#163;20 million. Many churches collect donations from their congregation to pay for necessary alterations&#8212;often basic alterations, such as to provide a toilet and to ensure that the whole community can access the building. Without greater reassurances, the Church told the Government, the extra 20% payable would result in projects already scheduled having to be cancelled, and many of those projects were part of initiatives that churches had been encouraged to undertake through the big society.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/4">The Government did not agree to a U-turn as such. I imagine they felt a bit embarrassed by that point, although that did not stop them performing another U-turn just days later&#8212;again, when Parliament was not sitting&#8212;on the charity tax. Instead, when they realised how hard churches would be hit, they agreed to give an extra &#163;30 million to the listed places of worship scheme, so that churches could claim the money back in grants.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/5">It is welcome that churches will no longer be hit with the huge extra cost of VAT, but my understanding of the Exchequer Secretary&#8217;s comments today is that churches will be asked to pay the VAT up front, then claim it back. They will have to raise the money to pay for the work they need to carry out, then wait for months to&#8212;hopefully&#8212;get it back. The hon. Gentleman says that measures have been put in place to make sure that churches do not suffer cash-flow problems, but I am not clear how much reassurance that provides. If he gives more detail when he winds up the debate, I am sure the House will be grateful. For a Government who say that they are waging war against red tape, it seems a bureaucratic</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/6">process to put in place. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> raised concerns not just about the bureaucracy for HMRC and the Treasury in processing the payments and rebates, but the bureaucracy for the churches, which could well do without it.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/7">I also understand that, contrary to what the Minister said about the Church of England&#8217;s being entirely happy with the proposal, many churches have expressed concern that the uncertainty would put them off accessing the scheme and relying on the VAT rebate. Churches could be deterred from undertaking necessary alterations and repairs. The other concern is that the measure does not help non-religious listed buildings, which still have to pay the 20% tax. Many people will choose not to go ahead with their projects. Among other things, that will hit jobs in the construction industry, and we all know how hard that has been hit by the downturn and the double-dip recession. It is an extra setback for that industry that listed building projects will not go ahead because of the 20% increase in cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/8">We have seen at least partial U-turns on the pasty, the caravan and the church, but the Government have refused to budge on two issues. Sports nutrition drinks are still being subjected to a 20% price hike while sugary milkshakes will still be VAT exempt. The Government want to put VAT on sports drinks that are advertised or marketed</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/9">&#8220;as products designed to enhance physical performance&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/10">or &#8220;accelerate recovery after exercise&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/11">The Minister sought to provide clarification for the Opposition, but I, for one, am none the wiser about the rationale behind the policy. No rationale has been offered for why a sports drink designed to provide and facilitate exercise and fitness should be targeted for VAT while drinks laden with refined sugars and fats are still exempt. Moreover, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> said earlier, the industry has raised serious concerns about whether milk and milk products will unintentionally be caught up in the ruling. From the Minister&#8217;s comments today, I wonder whether that is unintentional at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/12">We all remember the &#8220;Make mine milk&#8221; ads in which well known sportspeople such as Denise Lewis promoted the benefits of milk for sport. If milk has been marketed as something that enhances physical performance and sporting prowess, will the Government levy VAT on it? My understanding from the Government&#8217;s comments today is that they would. There is no indication about how the anomaly would be resolved by the Government or whether they even have an issue. For that reason, we will vote against this shambolic VAT reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/13">The final issue on which we have concerns is the VAT levied on hairdressers&#8217; chairs. The Chancellor wants self-employed hairdressers to pay 20% VAT on hiring a chair in a salon. With the cost of chair hire up, hairdressers will have to choose between passing the cost on to their customers or absorbing it themselves. Industry data show that that will disproportionately hit small businesses and their customers, especially women between 16 and 44 years old. Why do the Government think that a good idea?</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/14">If the measure is just another routine closing of an anomaly, have the Government considered who they are hitting with it and why? I am truly concerned that</p>
	<p pid="c.792.0/15">the measure looks as if it was worked out on the back of an envelope, without any consideration of how many jobs it might cost. Our amendment would force the Government to consider carefully the impact on jobs and growth before imposing VAT on any previously exempt products. It is not clear that they have given any thought to the change that I have mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="c.794.1/1">My hon. Friend read my mind as I gazed across the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="c.794.1/2">Giving a tax cut to millionaires and the banks but making it harder for self-employed women and their customers reveals a Government who are, once again, truly out of touch with ordinary people&#8217;s lives. New clause 12 seeks to go further on VAT and create a temporary reduction in the rate from 20% to 17.5%. The Liberal Democrats ran for election on a manifesto that warned of the dangers of a VAT rise with their pledge to protect constituents from the &#8220;VAT bombshell&#8221; threatened by the Conservatives. The Deputy Prime Minister pledged:</p>
	<p pid="c.794.1/3">&#8220;We will not have to raise VAT to deliver our promises&#8230;Let me repeat that: Our plans do not require a rise in VAT.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.794.1/4">Why were they so against VAT? Perhaps it is because the evidence clearly shows that people on lower incomes are hit proportionately much harder than the rich by VAT because they tend to spend more of their income rather than save and invest it. Government Members will claim that, looking at different measures, more VAT is paid by the rich&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> fell into that trap&#8212;but there is absolutely no debate about the fact that VAT is regressive and that those on lower incomes spend a higher proportion of their income on it than those on higher incomes. Even the Prime Minister agrees. In 2001, he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.794.1/5">&#8220;If you look at the effect...as compared with people&#8217;s income then, yes, it&#8217;s regressive&#8221;.</p>

Everybody agrees that we need demand in the economy. The way of generating demand in the economy is to put money back into people&#8217;s pockets. I remind hon.

	<p pid="c.795.9/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister&#8217;s figures assume that when VAT rises or falls, it has no impact on people&#8217;s expenditure? The thrust of what we have been saying, not just in response to the Budget, but for several months, is that the rise in VAT</p>
	<p pid="c.795.9/2">has dampened demand. The tax-take in May, for example, was down by 7%. Far from a static amount of money being drawn in, a VAT reduction would increase demand and, ultimately, increase the tax-take.</p>

	<p pid="c.796.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her characteristically rational contribution. I would add that the recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report estimated that the Government&#8217;s tax and benefit reforms will make a couple with children &#163;511 worse off in this financial year and &#163;1,250 a year worse off by 2015. It does not take an economic genius to work out what that does to demand in the economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.796.0/2">The Prime Minister admits that a 2.5% increase in VAT hits the poorest hardest, so what happened to, &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together&#8221;? I would like to hear an answer on that. As well as hitting poor people the hardest, higher VAT is hitting the economy at a time when we can least afford it. As we have discussed, the Chancellor unveiled a fuel duty cut last week, using mystery funding sources. Dropping VAT could have taken 3p a litre off petrol immediately. Across the board, a temporary cut in VAT would stimulate growth and get the economy moving again. Putting money back into people&#8217;s pockets is the only way to support businesses and create jobs&#8212;the very things that the Chancellor left out of his mangled Budget. That is why a temporary return to 17.5% is part of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan for jobs and growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.796.1/1">Is not another way to stimulate the economy to spend the money on employing the police officers who have been sacked and on reversing the ambulance cuts, the fire service cuts, the Army cuts and other cuts?

	<p pid="c.796.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Since June 2011 we have lost more than 100,000 public sector jobs, which means that there have been redundancies at a rate of one a minute since the Government took office. Yet the private sector, which the Prime Minister anticipated would flood in to create jobs, has simply not delivered. It has created only half that number of jobs, leaving the other half of those people on the dole and claiming benefits. That is pushing Government borrowing up, not down.</p>
	<p pid="c.796.2/2">The measures that we suggest would boost the economy and people&#8217;s spending power and ensure that we are not saddled with taxes that no one can afford. We want to see the economy moving into growth again.</p>

	<p pid="c.797.0/1">I am really very confused. My constituents have been saying exactly the same thing, which is why Labour Members have been arguing against this dreadful Budget in the Chamber, the Public Bill Committee and wherever we can.

	<p pid="c.797.1/1">It is surprising to me that, as far as we are aware from the comments of the shadow Minister, the Opposition will be voting against the very improvements that the hon. Lady says they have been working so hard to achieve. I do not doubt her good intentions or that she has been working very hard to represent her constituents, but if she was truly doing so, she would walk through the Lobby with the Government this evening, because they have listened thoroughly.</p>
	<p pid="c.797.1/2">Let us take the pasty tax, for example. It will not surprise Members that I am keen to talk about pasties, because not only am I a big fan and regular consumer of them, but I represent Cornwall, where they are an incredibly important industry. When I listened to the Budget some months ago, it was clear to me that the Government were doing exactly the right thing. They had seen some dreadful anomalies in VAT on food that had led to huge unfairness. Independent owners of fish and chip shops in my constituency had to pay VAT, but other outlets selling hot takeaway foods did not. The Government&#8217;s attempt to sort out VAT struck me as perfectly reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="c.797.1/3">We all know that what is really holding back growth in our economy is that for too long, small businesses have been massively overburdened by a dreadfully confused and muddled-up tax code. Under the last Government, the tax code multiplied and multiplied. We would probably have to use a wheelbarrow to carry all its volumes into the Chamber. The current Government are making a very reasonable effort to simplify some of the taxes that are such a burden on businesses in my constituency. They have listened carefully to the representations that have been made and are now going to create a level playing field for all people producing and selling takeaway food. That will benefit independent bakers in small businesses throughout Cornwall who bake pasties.</p>

	<p pid="c.797.2/1">As my hon. Friend is aware, the Government inherited the largest overspend and deficit in the developed world, so it was right for them to probe every possible area of tax revenue. It was also right for them to listen to people when representations were made and to respect parliamentary democracy. Does she agree that if the Labour party had listened to Back Benchers when it was in power, we would not have got into the mess that we are in and we would not have the vast deficit that the Government are having so valiantly to fight to reduce?</p>

	<p pid="c.797.3/1">My hon. Friend makes his point as passionately and persuasively as always, and he is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="c.797.3/2">To return to pasties&#8212;one of my favourite subjects&#8212;when I listened to the Budget, it was clear to me that there was a problem with the proposals as they stood. Some of the architects of those proposals clearly did not understand how pasties are baked in Cornwall. Within hours I spoke to my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary, who clearly understood the problem that I described to him. He said the Government realised that there could be some complications and unforeseen consequences, hence the reason for their consultation. Colleagues from around the country responded positively to that consultation, and their concerns have now been met.</p>
	<p pid="c.797.3/3">I am staggered by what the Opposition wish to inflict on our country by not supporting the Government tonight. In the nightmarish scenario that they won the Division, we would return to the situation in which the Treasury wastes hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money every year having to fight litigation cases against multi-million-pound companies that are trying to avoid paying VAT. The extremely complicated tax code that was developed under Labour over its 13 years was a lawyers charter. I have nothing against lawyers&#8212;I am married to a very good lawyer&#8212;but that ever-increasing and complicated tax code means that, not unreasonably, companies try to avoid paying tax. That causes Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs to be tied up in court, spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on lawyers fees that it could be spending in a far better way.</p>
	<p pid="c.797.3/4">It beggars belief, but what the Labour party is saying tonight is, &#8220;We are on the side of companies trying to avoid tax. We are on the side of lawyers who are constantly taking HMRC to court.&#8221; What a dreadful waste of taxpayers&#8217; money. The Government are trying to have a fair and simple tax system that everybody in the country can understand, so that we are not caught out by those who avoid taxation.</p>

	<p pid="c.798.0/1">I wonder whether the hon. Lady has noticed the size of the Bill.

	<p pid="c.798.1/1">No. As I have said&#8212;very clearly, I hope&#8212;the Government&#8217;s change will bring about a lot of clarity and be beneficial. For example, new schedule 1 clarifies what constitutes takeaway food and hot food. I accept the point that my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary made that we can never be 100% certain that companies will not litigate to try to wriggle their way out of paying their taxes, but the added clarity will be welcome to pasty makers. They will understand the situation that applies to pasties that are made and consumed in the way that they are in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="c.798.1/2">For the benefit of Opposition Members who do not seem to understand what master bakers do in pasty shops in Cornwall, I will explain that each day they get up very early to make high-quality bread, cakes and buns as well as pasties. They cook them on their premises so that they are beautiful and freshly made. Throughout the course of the day, anybody can buy freshly made bread, cakes, buns, scones or pasties. Thanks to the clarification in the new schedule, we can continue doing that in the certain knowledge that we will not pay VAT.</p>
	<p pid="c.798.1/3">Labour Members, however, who, feeling peckish on their way home tonight, decide to pop into the West Cornwall Pasty store, perhaps at the station, will, as in every other takeaway food outlet at the station, quite rightly pay VAT, because those pasties are deliberately kept warm all day long alongside other takeaway food. It is only right and proper, therefore, that they pay VAT.</p>
	<p pid="c.798.1/4">We did not have that clarity before. There were all sorts of loopholes that companies sought to exploit at huge cost to the Exchequer and, ultimately, to us taxpayers, because we pay the bills. I find it astonishing, therefore, that the Labour party is on the side of wealthy companies, with their deep pockets, and the lobby in favour of tax avoidance. I find that absolutely extraordinary.</p>

	<p pid="c.799.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. This affects master bakers, whether of pork pies, sausage rolls, steak pies or chicken pies, the length and breadth of the country. Those self-employed, highly skilled master craftsmen can carry on producing their much-loved regional foods, which we enjoy all over the country and make our country so distinct, as we celebrate our rich and varied food heritage. I hope that that addresses any misapprehensions among Labour Members about the benefits of the pasty tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.799.1/2">Much has been made of the Government&#8217;s U-turns. I welcome having a Government who, when they launch a consultation, as they did after the Budget, actually listen to representations on a range of measures, and I am pleased that the Chancellor is driving our economy in the right direction. We have to reduce our deficit and get our expenditure under control. The hard-working families and small businesses in my constituency understand that, and frankly will feel let down by this retread idea of a 2.5% reduction in VAT&#8212;the only proposal we hear from Opposition Members. But, of course, we do not know whether that will be their proposal tomorrow, next week or next month, because the shadow Minister could only say that it was the proposal today. If that is their only proposal and if it is only for today, how can families in my constituency have any confidence that they would drive the economy in a better direction? I am confident that the Chancellor is on the right road, and I am certain that focusing on the Budget, making sensible changes along the way, is the right way to go.</p>

	<p pid="c.799.3/3">The hon. Gentleman asked me about the changes to listed buildings. Having the beautiful Truro cathedral in my constituency, I was concerned about the proposals and immediately consulted the diocese and a wide range of churches in my constituency about their implications. I brought all that information to the Chancellor&#8217;s attention, as, I am sure, did Members across the House, and I was satisfied with his response. The Second Church Estates Commissioner, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>, is to be congratulated on how he co-ordinated all our efforts and on the work he has done with the Church Commissioners and the Treasury. Their solution is both practical and actionable, and has met with the perfect satisfaction of churches in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.799.3/4">I know that many Members wish to join in the debate, so I shall conclude. It is immensely important that we have a Government who listen, who consult on proposals and who then act on them. Whether on fuel duty, pasty taxes, caravan taxes or fuel taxes, my constituents are immensely pleased and relieved that the Government have listened and helped hard-working people and small businesses during these difficult times.</p>

	<p pid="c.800.0/1">I want to speak to new clause 3, although it might first be appropriate to pick up on one theme from the speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase>. She said she was pleased that the Chancellor was creating a level playing field. Well, if there is any area of the country where it would be difficult to create level playing fields, it would be in Truro. But anyway, I am pleased that she is satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="c.800.0/2">I wish to make a plea for a level playing field for young people in my constituency and other constituencies who go to sixth-form colleges, and I wish to compare their tax position with that of young people undertaking sixth-form studies in school. In a recent Westminster Hall debate, led by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase>, we discussed how poorer young people in sixth-form colleges or similar establishments were discriminated against in respect of free school dinners compared with young people in school. Here is yet another example of discrimination against young people depending on the institution they attend.</p>
	<p pid="c.800.0/3">I plead again with the Government, in respect of VAT, to treat sixth-form colleges as we treat schools with sixth forms. In Birkenhead, most pupils have no option but to attend sixth-form college if they want to</p>
	<p pid="c.800.0/4">undertake post-16 studies because the sixth forms of most of the schools were pooled together in that one enterprise. The VAT on services that the college purchases, but which schools do not pay, adds &#163;300,000 to the college budget&#8212;a reduction of 4% in that budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.800.0/5">My plea to the Chancellor will be brief and simple;I will not go up and down the country lanes, visiting various constituents, bakers and so on. He hoped to create a level playing field for taxation for sixth-form colleges and sixth forms in schools by the end of the Parliament. That was a noble objective, but the 2015 election, as it draws ever nearer, will certainly concentrate Government Members&#8217; minds not only on small U-turns but perhaps on more major ones.</p>
	<p pid="c.800.0/6">The Institute for Fiscal Studies undertook an analysis of the Government&#8217;s public expenditure changes which showed that the part of the education system that will be most handicapped and suffer the largest cuts by 2015 will be colleges of further education. Indeed, they will experience a 20% real-terms cut in their budgets by 2015. I know that it would not be in order to ask the Minister to respond to that, but given that the Government&#8217;s policies are making the playing field even more unequal for sixth-form colleges, compared with the treatment of sixth forms in schools, let me make a plea for him to concede that point and exempt sixth-form colleges, whose students are of an age group that if they were not at college, they would be in school.</p>

	<p pid="c.801.0/1">I do not understand why this has ever occurred. How come a sixth-form college is not treated exactly the same as a sixth form in a normal school? They may be in different areas, but they are essentially the same kids. I do not understand it, so perhaps the right hon. Gentleman&#8212;my friend, because I have known him a very long time&#8212;can tell me the answer.</p>

	<p pid="c.801.1/1">I am grateful for the intervention. Unfortunately I cannot give an answer, but I will redirect the question to the Minister. This time, I hope that he will give us an answer and&#8212;I hope even more&#8212;say that the Government intend to take action.</p>

	<p pid="c.801.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, who made an interesting contribution, on an issue that I was not planning to speak about, but which I hope will be pursued if his new clause is not accepted this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.801.2/2">This has been an interesting debate. I am only sorry that the Minister&#8217;s attempt to take us through every VAT change since 1973 was cut somewhat short. We got to about 1983, which was probably as far as most of us needed to get, but it was interesting none the less. The debate has also been interesting because of the number of food products that have been mentioned. At one point, when we were talking about rotisserie chickens, pasties and sausage rolls, I thought it was lunchtime at the Percy house, but apparently not. I am proud to say that I eat pasties: I ate my last one from Fuller&#8217;s bakery on the precinct in Goole just the other day. I cannot say that I partake of sports drinks, so I will not take much of an interest in that part of the debate, but I am certainly pleased that the Government have seen sense on pasties. I am not sure that I necessarily share the full analysis offered by my hon. Friend the Member for</p>
	<p pid="c.801.2/3">Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) about the seamless transition of policy. I do not think it has necessarily been the Government&#8217;s finest hour, but at least at the end of the process we have a system with which we can all live.</p>
	<p pid="c.801.2/4">I want to make a few brief comments about the caravan tax. It is a pleasure to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase>, who assisted with&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption</i> <i>]</i>&#8212;sorry, who led the campaign. I chide him with an in-joke. He led the campaign very ably and got us all together. He deserves credit for that, and I am pleased to see him here for this debate. The impact that the measure would have had is well documented from the various debates we have had. The Minister knows from the meetings we had with him that we were very concerned, particularly in our part of the world, where the vast majority of the relevant manufacturing is and where a lot of the supply chain is based, including, in my constituency in Brigg, a number of companies that were affected. I also have some of the parks that would have been affected in my constituency. I am pleased to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase>, who would have similarly been greatly affected, from the point of view of the park owners, had the measure gone forward. It is therefore incredibly important that we have reached the position we have.</p>
	<p pid="c.801.2/5">Some genuine points have been made about the consultation. One needs only to do a Google search to find headline after headline, in both local and national papers, about the state in which the industry has found itself in recent years. Indeed, it had to go to the previous Government looking for support, although I am not sure that a great deal was forthcoming. We are talking about an industry that has struggled considerably over the past few years, so quite who came up with the idea of slapping on 20% VAT, thereby affecting sales by up to 30%, I do not know, and I hope that some lessons will be learned. I prefer to see what the Government have done not as a U-turn, however. There was a US politician who used to describe a U-turn as a recalibration of policy, so I welcome this recalibration of policy. It is a shame that the previous Government did not do that on more occasions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="c.801.2/6">There are two issues that I want to go into in detail. First, the question of whether the previous position was an anomaly is still up for debate. I do not think we necessarily want to cede the principle that the previous regime of not subjecting holiday statics to VAT was indeed an anomaly. There is an argument to be had about that. The second thing I want to pursue is the assurances we have heard, which I am pleased the Minister gave at the Dispatch Box, in so far as he is able when it comes to future tax policy. We have been assured that it is unlikely that the Government will seek to look at the issue again. I am sure that we would all welcome that and that the Minister will welcome not having colleagues from all parts of the country banging on his door, as we did.</p>

	<p pid="c.803.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Now that a 5% VAT rate has been introduced, does he agree that any Government, whether the coalition or a future Labour Government, would be ill-advised to return to this issue with any form of increase? The level of 5% can be accepted. People do not pay council tax on these caravans. We are talking about a compromise, but one that can last, that the industry can live with and that the political establishment should live with. Indeed, no Government should ever think of returning to the issue at any time while even someone as young as my hon. Friend is in this House.</p>

	<p pid="c.803.1/1">I am being abolished at the next election anyway, so there are only three years in which the Government might have to worry about me. However, they would frankly be stupid&#8212;if that is not unparliamentary language&#8212;to look at the issue again. I think any Government will take note of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="c.803.1/2">The final assurance I seek from the Minister is that we will continue to be conscious that there will still be a potential impact, as was mentioned in interventions by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase>, who also fought valiantly. I hope that the Treasury will continue to monitor that.</p>
	<p pid="c.803.1/3">In the final minute, I want quickly to say something about the Opposition&#8217;s VAT cut for millionaires, which I think is what they are proposing. Whereas we on this side of the House have decided to target tax changes at those struggling the most&#8212;for example, by raising the personal allowance and taking some of the poorest out of tax altogether&#8212;the Opposition policy is to issue a massive VAT cut for high earners and millionaires, and just to pepper money around. The Opposition are not quite sure how much&#8212;they have not told us, although we think the figure might be &#163;12 billion&#8212;and they do not know for how long the measure would be in place. What a policy! The interesting thing we have learnt is that we now know that the Opposition&#8217;s official policy is to support, ultimately, VAT at 20%, because they have said that the measure would be temporary, meaning that they have therefore definitely agreed the 20% rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.804.1/1">This section of the debate is about VAT. When we are in a double-dip recession, the imposition of VAT on items such as caravans is not going to help us to grow out of that economic position. That is what I will concentrate on.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/2">The proposal for 20% VAT to be levied on static caravans came out of the blue in the Budget. There had been no consultation with the industry, and no warning that the Government were planning that measure. The impact assessment published alongside the Budget stated that the 20% VAT would result in a 30% reduction in the market for static caravans. The Government&#8217;s U-turn involved a 75% reduction in the amount of VAT involved, and 5% will now be levied from April 2103, as opposed to 20% from October 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/3">I can go some way towards welcoming the fact that the Government have listened and put forward a response to the widespread view that the imposition of 20% VAT would have been a disaster. There was cross-party work on the issue, with a number of debates, early-day motions and petitions. I will give the Minister his due; he did take the time to listen to what people had to say, especially those from my part of the world. However, serious concerns remain about the effect that the 5% VAT will have, and I want to run through them tonight.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/4">I want to talk first about jobs and demand, which are at the heart of the issue. As I said, the Treasury&#8217;s own figures showed that the imposition of 20% VAT would have resulted in a 30% reduction in demand for static caravans. It worries me that the Treasury seems incapable of using figures appropriately. When I looked at the impact assessment, I realised that it had got the figures for businesses and manufacturers in the caravan industry wrong. It worries me that it cannot even get such basic information correct when it sets out to consult on a proposal. I want to see much better research into the impact of the 5% VAT on caravan manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/5">I have not been reassured by what the Minister has told me today, even though I have pressed him to tell me what will happen to manufacturers in the caravan industry. I did not feel that he really had a grasp of what the numbers might be. It worries me that there has been no proper assessment of this policy. Does he think that levying 5% VAT will put at risk roughly a quarter of the demand that the 20% VAT would have put at risk? Does he also think that the number of job losses in the caravan manufacturing industry will be reduced from the 6,000 mentioned in KPMG&#8217;s report to about 1,500 as a result of the change in VAT? Will he also comment on the knock-on effects for the wider UK tourism and domestic holiday industry?</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/6">I want to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the HMRC document, &#8220;VAT: Taxing Holiday Caravans&#8221;, which was published at the end of last week. On the economic impact of the 5%, it states:</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/7">&#8220;This measure is likely to lead to an increase in the price of static and larger touring caravans which could lead to a fall in demand.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/8">I take the view that the Treasury civil servants are among the brightest and best that the civil service has to offer, and it seems odd that they have been able to come up with nothing more definitive than that the measure &#8220;could&#8221; lead to a fall in demand. The document goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/9">&#8220;Although the overall impact on the macro economy is expected to be negligible, the measure will impact local manufacturing in Yorkshire and the Humber where the bulk of static holiday caravans are manufactured.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/10">Most people in Hull and East Yorkshire would agree with that, but surely the Treasury can come up with something better. The section of the document entitled &#8220;Impact on businesses including civil society organisations&#8221; states:</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/11">&#8220;The vast majority of static holiday caravans are manufactured in Yorkshire and the Humber and a small number of manufacturers account for the vast majority of all UK sales. Although some manufacturers produce other types of caravans, static caravans are the main source of income for most of these manufacturers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/12">Again, it worries me that the document uses such general terms. Where is the meat in all this? Where are the figures? Where does it tell us what the actual economic impact of the policy will be?</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/13">Let us bear in mind that we are in a double-dip recession and we are all desperate to get growth back into the economy. I mentioned in an intervention that 46.3 people in my constituency chase every job vacancy going, so any loss of jobs in the caravan manufacturing industry is a disaster for my constituents. I think that the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole mentioned that the caravan industry suffered very badly in 2008-09, and it is only just getting back on its feet. If the Treasury thinks that the imposition of 5% VAT will be fine for an industry that is struggling in a double-dip recession when people are not spending, it really needs to look again at its figures and ensure that they all add up.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/14">The Minister said that the goods within a caravan were already taxed, in that VAT had already been levied on such items. My understanding is that the figure involved is about 5%. Will he tell us whether the 5% proposed in the Bill will be an additional 5%, making a total of about 10% VAT payable? I am confused by that, and the Minister has not made it clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/15">One of the strongest arguments against the initial proposal for 20% VAT was that it would raise very little revenue for the Treasury. When taking that into account, we also need to consider the welfare costs that would be incurred from people in the industry losing their jobs. Has the Minister looked at the figures involved? Does he think that the sums add up?</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/16">HMRC now estimates that the 5% VAT will first raise revenue in 2013-14, when it will bring in &#163;5 million a year, rising to &#163;10 million a year from 2013-14. That is a relatively small amount of money, given the Government&#8217;s overall spending, especially in the light of the millions that they have found in the Budget for tax cuts for</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/17">millionaires. Let us put this into perspective: &#163;10 million is perhaps a third or half of what Mr Diamond&#8217;s severance payment might be.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/18">This measure will have an impact from next year onwards, while raising &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million. When we take into account the fall in demand in the industry and the resulting job losses, I do not think that the Treasury will end up in credit. Introducing the measure could result in more money being spent, through welfare benefits. Will the Minister set out for me the sums that he is using to ensure that the measure will bring a net benefit to the Treasury? In my view, this is an ill thought-through policy, and these are crazy economics.</p>
	<p pid="c.804.1/19">The Minister referred to the manufacturing standard, BS 3632. As I said in my intervention, using a manufacturing standard to dictate tax policy is silly.</p>

	<p pid="c.806.0/1">I want to return to the hon. Lady&#8217;s point about the overall costs. A significant percentage of the cost of a new caravan is found in the chattels inside, which already have VAT on them. So the additional overall cost will not be higher than 5%; it will be more like 3% or 4% on the overall average retail cost of a caravan. The manufacturers are telling me that they think that that can broadly be absorbed within their business model. It will have some negative impact, but a fairly minimal one. We are certainly not talking about 10% costs, but about rather less than 5%.</p>

	<p pid="c.806.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, and I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the work he did on this matter. However, I would really like to hear from the Minister what the VAT level is going to be, because my understanding is that it is 5% plus the additional VAT already levied. The hon. Gentleman says that it is 3% or 4% and not 5%, but is that 3% or 4% on top of the 5%, which would mean it was 8% or 9%, not 5%?</p>

	<p pid="c.806.4/1">Basically, VAT has already been paid on those chattels, so if 25% of the cost of the caravan were for the chattels, that already includes VAT, so we are looking at 5% on 75% of the overall cost of the caravan. That is why it is significantly less than 5% as an addition to the actual cost when someone goes to a park to try to buy a caravan. The additional costs as a result of this change will be significantly less than 5%&#8212;I say that clearly and categorically.</p>

	<p pid="c.806.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman again, but I would still like to hear from the Minister exactly what the figure will be. My understanding&#8212;I was at the same meeting with the caravan manufacturers in Beverley as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase>&#8212;was that a figure was levied across the whole price of the caravan, including the chattels in the caravan at around 3% or 4% of the overall cost. Will the Minister clarify that? Are there two figures that we need to be aware of, or is it just 5% overall of the total amount of the purchase? I have to tell the Government that if this</p>
	<p pid="c.806.5/2">were intended to make things clearer, the truth is that it is making things even more complicated and less transparent.</p>
	<p pid="c.806.5/3">Let me return to the BS 3632 specification. I was saying that I thought that that was not a sensible way to make tax policy. I know that the distinction between static caravans and those used for residential purposes 365 days of the year is based on the reference to BS 3632. If we look at the responses to HMRC&#8217;s consultation, we see that while many respondents felt it would be relatively straightforward to upgrade static caravans to meet the BS 3632 standard so that they could benefit from zero-rated standing, many others said that the costs of doing so would be prohibitive. There is a confusion there, which is why I would like the Minister to be very clear about it.</p>
	<p pid="c.806.5/4">With certified British standards changing all the time because manufacturing gets better and better, how often does the Minister think he would need to return to this tax provision to update it? I doubt whether it will be set in stone for years to come; it will have to be looked at and changed in the future. I heard the Minister&#8217;s reassurance that we would not see changes to the standard in the future, but he is opening the door to potential changes. The system that the Minister has devised, based on the British standard and keeping the distinction between static, residential and touring caravans, does not make things clearer and more transparent; rather, I think it extends the anomalies in the tax system.</p>
	<p pid="c.806.5/5">An even bigger issue for me is the lack of clear evidence of what the change to VAT policy will do for my constituents and for jobs in my city. That is what really concerns and worries me. I know that the Minister has listened carefully to my pleas about employment and jobs. I hope he will think again and will instruct his officials to do a proper piece of work, so that when MPs scrutinise Government policy, they will have accurate figures to look at in order to assess whether the Government&#8217;s policies will result in what they say they are trying to achieve. In this case, I do not think the Government will see additional revenue in the Exchequer. If they bring forward this ill thought-through proposal, which will disproportionately affect my constituents, there will be a loss to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.807.0/1">I feel as if I have fallen into a parallel universe in this debate. It is interesting, is it not, that although Labour crashed the economy so totally, Labour Members today want to provide a &#163;12 billion giveaway by reducing VAT&#8212;something that would presumably have to be paid for by further cuts in the public services that they say they want to protect, or indeed by an increase in borrowing. It seems inconceivable to me that this measure is on the amendment paper in the name of Labour Members. I recall that when I was growing up there was television programme called &#8220;Jamie and the Magic Torch&#8221;. I used to enjoy it considerably, but it seems that we have a show on the other side of the Chamber tonight called &#8220;Ed and the Magic Money Tree&#8221;, with the Opposition unable to be clear or consistent about their VAT policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/2">Another bizarre aspect of the debate is that when the Government are forced into what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> refers</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/3">to as a &#8220;recalibration&#8221; on a number of issues, which my constituents certainly welcome, the Opposition oppose the measures that the Government are taking to address the problems that they initially highlighted. It strikes me as utterly bizarre that, a few months ago, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase>and her hon. Friends raised concerns, as did I and other hon. Members, about the pasty tax, the caravan tax, the problems affecting static caravans and other issues, yet tonight the same hon. Lady and her colleagues are going to vote against the U-turn that the Government have made. It may well be the case that the Government have made a U-turn, but it is clear from the positioning going on tonight that Labour has taken a wrong turn.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/4">Labour Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot criticise a Government for being cavalier when they do not listen, and then criticise them as chaotic when they do listen. As they well know, the reality is that on all these issues, particularly on tackling anomalies in the VAT system, the problems were set out in the consultation that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor rightly announced. That consultation was widely subscribed to by many interested parties, and the Government took the responses to it into account and changed their view on the back of the evidence they received. I for one recognise that none of us has a monopoly of wisdom. It is surely in the finest traditions of good government that the people likely to be affected by these rules are listened to and that a Government take advice if a deleterious effect is pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/5">Labour Members talk about the need to consult, but when they abolished the 10p tax rate, plunging millions of the lowest paid into further tax, I do not think they consulted on that measure. That is why, as I say, the last few moments of the debate have been somewhat eye-opening, highlighting the sheer opportunism of the Opposition in opposing a U-turn. They call for consultation, then, in the very debate that shows that the Government are listening, they choose to ignore it. Frankly, as I said at the outset, that is bizarre.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/6">My constituents would want me to welcome new schedule 1 and Government amendment 17. Those provisions will protect jobs in Cornwall, protect the Cornish high street and high streets across the country, protect the secondary spend in the wider economy and will ensure that Cornwall, which is already a disadvantaged part of the our United Kingdom, is not further disadvantaged by proposals that the Government have, thankfully, amended.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/7">I would also like to thank the Minister. In all the discussions between him, me and my hon. Friends, he has always been entirely professional, courteous and constructive in his engagement. I would like to thank others, too. As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North knows, Greggs is based in her constituency. Its effort to mobilise more than 500,000 signatures across the country for a petition that my hon. Friends in Cornwall and me were able to deliver to Downing street showed the level of grass-roots concern about proposals that could have been very damaging.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/8">I thank the National Association of Master Bakers; that is not a sentence that one wants to rush through! Its engagement with this issue has been constructive and professional, and it has represented the views of its industry to the Government very effectively. For what</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/9">will probably be the only time in my life, I also thank and pay tribute to</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/10" class="italic">The Sun</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/11">, which ensured that the issue touched the popular zeitgeist and was able, ultimately, to deliver change. More locally, the</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/12" class="italic">Western Morning News</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/13">, the voice of the south-west, played a useful role in keeping the issue in the public eye.</p>
	<p pid="c.807.0/14">I can tell the Minister that people in Cornwall are relieved that this coalition Government took soundings, listened and, at the end of the day, delivered a result that will protect an iconic and important Cornish industry. It is estimated that the measure will safeguard about 13,000 jobs in Cornwall, put hundreds of millions of pounds into the local economy, and guarantee the production of the 180 million Cornish pasties that are made in the county every year.</p>

	<p pid="c.809.0/1">Everyone has been saying how great it is that VAT will no longer be charged on pasties, but I should point out those who own fish and chip shops are at a slight disadvantage by comparison. I just want to balance the equation a bit, and that is one of the things that we were trying to put right.</p>

	<p pid="c.809.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. He will be pleased to know that new schedule 1 will deliver the level playing field to which he and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister have referred, and on the subject of which I have received representations from fish and chip shops in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.809.1/2">If a product in a fish and chip shop is being kept artificially warm it is standard-rated, and new schedule 1 will ensure that the same applies in a pasty or pie shop. The simplicity for which the Government aimed has been delivered, as has the level playing field for suppliers of hot food. I hope that my hon. Friend will convey to the fish and chip shop proprietors in his constituency with some enthusiasm the message that, as a result of the constructive process of consultation and engagement undertaken by the Government, the special status of baked goods which are hot only as a product of their baking process has been recognised. The fact that a freshly baked hot pasty which is simply cooling down, will remain VAT-free should be welcomed by one and all.</p>

	<p pid="c.809.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">The hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase> seemed to think that he was living in a parallel universe, and, indeed, most of us Opposition Members thought that we were living in one as well. The process that has taken place is rather like the process that takes place when someone says &#8220;I want &#163;10 from you&#8221;, and then, after a great deal of argument, says &#8220;I will make it just &#163;2, so you should be happy&#8221;, and we find ourselves saying &#8220;Thank you so much for listening.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.809.2/2">Yes, it was good that the Government listened. I do not think that any Opposition Member has said otherwise, although we might have preferred them to listen from the outset. They had an opportunity to do so on Second Reading. One or two Conservative and Liberal Democrat Back Benchers voted against the Government even then in order to make their views known, but many others who had heard the Government say that the measures were necessary voted for them. Yes, it is good that the Government have listened, but it might have been better had they never embarked on this road. We must ask</p>
	<p pid="c.809.2/3">whether it was sensible for the Treasury&#8212;which, one assumes, is in charge of our economy to some extent&#8212;to spend the last four months dealing with matters which it had, after all, generated in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="c.810.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government listened only partially, especially when it came to the imposition of VAT on listed buildings? Churches will still have to undergo a bureaucratic process in order to claim it back, and other listed buildings will still be subject to VAT for repairs. That could really affect the country&#8217;s heritage.</p>

	<p pid="c.810.1/1">I shall say something about precisely that issue later.</p>
	<p pid="c.810.1/2">The time and effort of officials and politicians was largely wasted by a process that, in some but not all instances, led us back to where we started at a time when the economy was tanking. Could not much of that energy have been expended on something far more worth while? It was said on Second Reading that this was not a Budget for jobs and growth but a Budget that tinkered at the edges of various issues, and the Government have themselves conceded that all that tinkering was probably a bad idea.</p>

	<p pid="c.810.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the VAT measures in the Budget had a major effect on business confidence in certain industries? For instance, when the caravan industry was threatened with the imposition of a 20% rate, some companies issued their work forces with 90-day potential redundancy notices.</p>

	<p pid="c.810.3/1">Of course the stress and anxiety affected confidence and well-being. Indeed, it may have led to a further plunge in demand as people anticipated the impending redundancy which, thankfully, did not come about in many cases. That is an important consideration at a time when the economy is struggling so much.</p>
	<p pid="c.810.3/2">I think that a great deal of time was wasted because the Government included measures in the Budget rather than dealing with the position earlier. If they believed that there were anomalies in the VAT system, why did they not consult? As I have suggested before, they could have said &#8220;We are minded to look at these things&#8221; at the time of the autumn statement, rather than at a time when they were putting together a Budget that, apparently, they wanted to balance. We heard a lot about that at the time.</p>
	<p pid="c.810.3/3">Why did the Government not say &#8220;We want to look at these anomalies and review them in a general context&#8221;? One of our amendments proposes that that should happen in future. If there is to be consultation, it should be proper consultation. Saying, as the Chancellor did in March, &#8220;This is what we have to do and this is why we have to do it, but we will have a bit of consultation afterwards&#8221; is putting the cart before the horse. I hope that that lesson will be learned for the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.811.0/1">That may indeed may be the case. I recall that in 2007 a new council took charge in Edinburgh&#8212;it was a Liberal Democrat-SNP coalition&#8212;and it announced that it was planning to close some 22 schools. There was a very interesting cartoon in the local paper. It showed officials coming out of a meeting with the new administration and turning to each other and saying, &#8220;We never expected them to accept all that. That was a starter for 10, and we thought we&#8217;d get beaten back.&#8221; The officials had put forward this proposal and the new and inexperienced administration had said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go for that.&#8221; It did them some reputational damage. They proposed closing 22 schools, but then had to roll back very substantially because of the public outcry. The officials had expected to be told, &#8220;Actually, that&#8217;s not what we want to do. That&#8217;s not sensible. Let&#8217;s see the proper workings before we ever go public on this.&#8221; Perhaps the suggestion that this Budget measure was a consequence of our having a very inexperienced Government and Chancellor was right, therefore.</p>

	<p pid="c.811.2/1">I will resist the temptation to take up my hon. Friend&#8217;s invitation to agree with that view, because we have to be tolerant, to a degree, of inexperience. There is currently a strong cult of youth and inexperience in our politics, but that might change, and it might at some point in the future be acknowledged that there is merit in looking to those who have had experience of life and living before entering politics, rather than to those who become as exalted as the Chancellor of the Exchequer before they have lived and experienced a great deal of ordinary life.</p>
	<p pid="c.811.2/2">I shall spare Members from having to listen to me list all the listed buildings in my constituency that are not churches. Those who want to know what those buildings are can read the relevant Committee report in <i>Hansard</i>. There is an important point, however. It has been assumed that because the Government made a concession&#8212;albeit not a full one, perhaps&#8212;to churches, the problem has been solved. There are other listed buildings that are not churches, however, which will now face the 20% rate with no financial assistance or concession made to them. These buildings are equally important. Churches are extremely important as historical monuments, even if some of them are no longer used as churches. In Edinburgh, there are examples of churches that have been converted to other uses, but there are other buildings that are at risk, too, and imaginative alterations might be made to some of them in order to put them into community use. This extra cost will put some such community projects at risk, however, and will put some buildings at risk, too. If those buildings cannot be put into community use, it is likely that they will deteriorate and end up having to be demolished on safety grounds.</p>

	<p pid="c.812.0/1">I agree. The Government have pointed out that VAT falls on repairs but it did not previously fall on alterations, and they say we should equalise the situation. That misses the point. Alterations often enable buildings to have a different use from their previous one. They are made to be able to function again for either business, residential or community-use purposes. Such alterations are generally bigger projects than simply repairing the roof and ensuring that the rain does not come in. The costs involved can be great, and this 20% addition to the cost will therefore be very considerable and will put many such projects at risk. Many people have made that point, and do not feel the Government concession in respect of churches goes nearly far enough. We must bear that in mind. We will find out in the future whether these concerns were right.</p>
	<p pid="c.812.0/2">In respect of VAT at least, this Budget has been shambolic. It is not good enough for people to say, &#8220;Well, because there has been a change, the whole process is now a good one.&#8221; It has not been a good one reputationally for the Government&#8212;and perhaps we, as Opposition Members, should be pleased about that. We cannot be pleased, however, when we see the effects that a declining economy has on so many of our constituents, who feel they are faced with a Government who truly are not caring.</p>
	<p pid="c.812.0/3">Let us think about the arguments made in defence of some of these changes. On listed buildings, we have heard all sorts of arguments, such as, &#8220;The previous situation allowed rich people to build swimming pools.&#8221; There was no particular evidence of that, but the Chancellor obviously thought it was a good argument to put up because he liked the idea of presenting himself as being on the side of the small person rather than the rich&#8212;despite the overall effect of his Budget policies.</p>

	<p pid="c.813.1/1">My hon. Friend may be that cruel, but I probably would not go that far.</p>
	<p pid="c.813.1/2">New clause 12 is not a highly principled statement that VAT should be 17.5% rather than 20%, as it would apparently be just a temporary reduction. Moreover, when Labour was in government, it had plans to raise VAT. These are the stances Labour has taken recently: before the election, it had a plan to raise VAT; later, when there was a proposal for a VAT rise, Labour abstained; and now it proposes a temporary cut, back down to 17.5%. The country can be forgiven for not knowing what on earth Labour&#8217;s view is. If Labour ever got back into power, would it reduce VAT from this 20% rate that it seems to so loathe?</p>
	<p pid="c.813.1/3">This Labour new clause proposes a temporary cut that would apply from Royal Assent to the Bill until the UK economy returns to strong growth. No definition of &#8220;strong growth&#8221; has been provided. When I asked for one, we were not told that it was 2% or 3% a year. We did not get a sensible approach about it being when the economy is growing based on balanced growth and sustainable industries such as manufacturing, rather than on inflating a massive debt-filled boom. We were told that &#8220;strong growth&#8221; meant not being in a double-dip recession any more. We could end up in a bizarre situation whereby we reduce VAT on Royal Assent and then, when we get the last quarter&#8217;s financial data, which I am sure we all hope show the economy growing again, we have to reverse the temporary cut. It could be in place for only a matter of days, which would result in a huge administrative cost; the move would be utterly pointless. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear someone saying from a sedentary position that that is ridiculous, but that is what the new clause would mean. We are doing a serious thing here. We are legislating, not engaging in sixth-form school debate. If we were to pass this new clause tonight, it would be in the Finance Bill, it would become law and it would have to come into effect. This is not a little proposal that we can idly dismiss but an actual idea that the Opposition want us to legislate for. It is clearly nonsensical on all levels, and we need discuss it no further.</p>
	<p pid="c.813.1/4">Let me return to the various changes to VAT charging in new schedule 1, where, again, the Government have done exactly the right thing. They proposed some ideas, realised that they contained some mistakes and things that may be impossible to implement, and then changed them in order to get to a better policy. That is surely what we want Government consultations to end up with.</p>
	<p pid="c.813.1/5">We do not want the Government to announce something, consult on it and then blindly drive on without listening to any of the criticisms and details of any mistakes in it.</p>

	<p pid="c.814.1/1">I agree with the hon. Lady, and I said yesterday that it would be better to consult before trying to legislate, but we did have a detailed consultation document that looked at this idea. I do not think that the legislation to implement this proposal was in the original draft of the Finance Bill, but it would have been brought forward by a statutory instrument later on; although it was announced as an idea, it was not in a legislative form at that point, so strictly speaking the Government have done what she calls for.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/2">I wish to make one comment on the pasty tax, as an aside. It is clear that when making tax policy we have to avoid things that have a handy popular nickname. We have had big campaigns on the &#8220;pasty tax&#8221; and the &#8220;caravan tax&#8221;. It has been a bit harder to get the public behind a &#8220;sports drinks nutritional drink tax.&#8221; If it had been called a &#8220;Lucozade tax&#8221;, there might have been more publicity. The Government should be careful in making future tax policy to look out for what nicknames might be used. However, those who favour tax being understandable may feel that all taxes should have a simple nickname so that the public understand what they are for.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/3">On the new &#8220;pasty tax&#8221; definitions, I am concerned that we might end up with some things that are unclear, such as the definitions of what is being &#8220;marketed&#8221; as &#8220;hot&#8221; and of what wrapping is allowed. We are told, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it will be clear in HMRC guidance what is allowed.&#8221; However, we should be trying to legislate clearly: Parliament should be clear in what it says. I hope the Minister can put on the record that bakeries on the high street that are trying to sell freshly baked products will not find those things subject to VAT unless they are kept hot or are wrapped in a heat-retaining bag, and that using ordinary, simple packaging or marketing those products as &#8220;freshly baked&#8221; will not be caught. That is absolutely the intention that Parliament has, and we should make it clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/4">On sports drinks, I am concerned about going down the road of having a principle of deciding a tax treatment on the basis of how something is advertised or marketed, rather than on the fundamental underlying nature of the product. We can see that strange ways of how someone chooses to market something might change the tax treatment. I think I understand the aim of this proposal, which is to provide for high-sugar drinks sold as sports drinks when they are not much different from Coca-Cola or other fizzy products that we are trying to equalise the VAT treatment on. The wording in new schedule 1 leaves where the line is open to question.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/5">We exchanged comments earlier about whether milk could strictly drift into being covered by the wording if it was marketed as something that aids physical performance and whether we risk a court, at some point, taking an utterly perverse and stupid view that milk is caught by the provision, given that we clearly do not intend it to be. We need to be careful what we mean. That line will</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/6">be tested and people will ask, &#8220;What is a sports drink that is largely based on milk or some milk-derived product, and what is an ordinary pint of milk?&#8221; Where will we draw the line about what is VAT-able? A Mars drink is advertised with the slogan, &#8220;Unlike other sports drinks, this milk product actually tastes nice.&#8221; It is hard to understand why a Mars milk-flavoured drink is not going to attract VAT but a sports drink will. We need to be careful to avoid people not knowing what we actually mean.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/7">If I market a whey-based product that is made up into a drink as a sports product, VAT will apply, but if I market it as a diet product or a nutritional supplement, perhaps for the elderly who are struggling to get enough calories in their diet, that will presumably not be VAT-able. All I have to do if I want to buy the thing to use it for sports purposes is choose the one marketed for an old person&#8217;s supplement, and although I would be able to use it in exactly the same way as the sports drink on the next shelf, I would be buying it for 20% less. I am not entirely sure that that is what we intend. Although I understand what is going on, we have to be careful if we start defining tax policy based on how something is sold and not on the underlying product.</p>
	<p pid="c.814.1/8">With those few remarks, may I finally commend the Government on the position they have got these things into? It is vastly better than where we started, and I will certainly vote for new schedule 1.</p>

	<p pid="c.815.4/1">What Labour would have had is jobs and growth. We would not have been in a double-dip recession and we would not be in this stupid position of cutting too fast and too deep, which is ruining the British economy. Unfortunately, we are not in government.</p>
	<p pid="c.815.4/2">It has been incredibly difficult to prepare this speech, because it is hard to work out, in this omnishambles of a Budget, what this disorganised Government have done a U-turn on. Perhaps I should not call them U-turns, because in many cases the Government have done them</p>
	<p pid="c.815.4/3">only partially; I am not sure whether these are L-turns or C-turns. I thought that they had done a full U-turn on the caravan tax, but I discovered this afternoon that they have not done a full U-turn at all, and the pasty tax is as clear as mud. I was having a discussion with colleagues before this debate as to what food is now VAT-able and what is not. It seems that a rotisserie chicken that will be cold when someone eats it is VAT-able, whereas a pasty that comes out of the oven will not be, unless it is put on a hot plate. But what happens if the oven is put on low so that the pasty is just kept warm? Will that pasty be VAT-able or not? The Minister needs to explain to me and the nation how this proposal is different from his first proposal, and how it is to be policed. Will taxmen regularly visit all the sandwich shops in the country to check on their ovens? That needs further explanation.</p>
	<p pid="c.815.4/4">What about the mess of heritage tax?

	<p pid="c.816.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Clearly, I do not believe that &#163;30 million is anywhere near the sum needed to compensate. Of course, the Government have also said that those people will get lottery and Government grants, but hang on a minute: is that not just taking with one hand and paying back with another? The change has been a huge blow to many communities that have been working for years and years to raise enough money to rescue old buildings and convert them for use for the whole community, only to now have to find another 20%.</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/2">The Government have tried to say that we should not worry too much about the heritage tax as it is really about charging millionaires who live in listed buildings and who get their indoor swimming pool tax-free, but there is no evidence for that. They conclude on the basis of a review of 105 applications that the majority of the work covered by the relief is</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/3">&#8220;not necessary for heritage purposes&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/4">but as nearly 30,000 listed building applications are made a year, that does not seem to me to be good evidence. From a sample of 12,049 applications, only 34 were for swimming pools. Perhaps we could deal with the problem in a slightly different way rather than imposing the heritage tax on all buildings. Indeed, 50% of those who live in listed buildings are in socio-economic groups C1, C2, D and E&#8212;supervisory, clerical, junior management, administrative, skilled workers, semi-skilled workers and unskilled workers. People in those groups are not usually millionaires.</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/5">That implementation of VAT will not raise a great deal of money in the scheme of things, but will be another blow to the construction industry and run the risk of more of our heritage buildings going to rack and ruin. Of course, once VAT is put on something it can never be returned to zero.</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/6">Skip taxes seem to have been introduced and then withdrawn. I think they probably have been withdrawn&#8212;who would know? The Government seem to introducing a self-storage tax, however. Self-storage is often used by people in transition, such as those who are selling or buying houses or those whose homes are undergoing renovation. It is also used by people who have downgraded or moved to a different community and therefore have to live in much smaller accommodation. It is usually in a prime location so that customers can come and go as they choose, changing their winter wardrobe for their summer wardrobe or taking goods in or out of storage. Removals and storage providers have storage facilities as an ancillary part of the business and are therefore frequently in more remote places, as the location of the property does not need to attract customers. One reason for putting VAT on self-storage was to level the playing field for removal companies, even though they have different purposes. The effect will be that ordinary people will be hit again. Businesses that use self-storage to store documents and so on will be able to reclaim the VAT, but the ordinary person will not.</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/7">I think we still have a hairdressers tax. That will mean that self-employed hairdressers who rent a chair in a small salon will have no choice other than to register for VAT and decide whether to charge their customers VAT at 20% or to absorb the cost themselves. Of course, that will particularly hit females aged between 16 and 46&#8212;the very people whom the Government say they want to encourage to be entrepreneurs, start up their own businesses and pay into society.</p>
	<p pid="c.816.1/8">The situation with sports nutrition is another unholy mess. If I have got this right&#8212;I hope that the Minister will correct me if I have not&#8212;sports drinks will become VAT-able, but sports nutrition products will not. If the Minister wants to intervene, I am happy for him to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.817.1/1">Does that mean that it will be exempt if a liquid product is made into a solid and people are just advised to drink water with it? What about weight-management products? More than 20% of the products in the sports nutrition category are for weight management. If they are slimming products, they are zero-rated, but they could also be considered to be sports nutrition products. We could have a bizarre situation in which men and women who exercise hard, follow a balanced diet and use sports nutrition products to help them get into shape would pay VAT, whereas those who skip meals, sit on the sofa and take magic slimming products would not.</p>
	<p pid="c.817.1/2">It seems odd that we are making that tax change in Olympic year, when we are encouraging people to get fit, but it is typical of this Budget. It is a shambles that will create more anomalies than it will resolve. With all the U-turns&#8212;even though we welcome some of them&#8212;it is still totally confusing.

	<p pid="c.817.1/4">all hit hard-pressed businesses and do absolutely nothing for jobs and growth. The millionaires still get their tax cut, but they are not paying the tax that is due. If the rest of us decided not to pay our taxes, could we have a tax cut too? Or does that apply only to the very rich, who can also avoid their tax by paying accountants a great deal of money to do so?</p>
	<p pid="c.817.1/5">The Government forget that there was a global economic crash. They do not like to talk about it. They like to say that it was all the previous Government&#8217;s fault, but there was a global economic crash that affected all the countries in the world. They forget that they have created a double-dip recession&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i> They like to laugh, but they inherited an economy that was growing. In two years, they have managed to turn that into a double-dip recession made totally in Downing street. They believe that continuing to cut and cut will somehow magically bring change and growth. Government Members are prepared to accept compromises in their areas of interest but will let others face the full force of the VAT rises. They are prepared to vote for these provisions, even though it means that other businesses and other ordinary people will continue to suffer. The proposal is an omnishambles that will do nothing for jobs and growth and it is simply typical of this Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.818.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" speakername="Charlie Elphicke" colnum="818"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0002.htm#120703128001376">
	<p pid="c.818.0/1">I want to speak briefly about new schedule 1. In my constituency is A and S Self Storage, run by Diana and George Pelly, which is a small family-run storage business. My concern is about how the new measure will work and I hope that Ministers will take on board some of my points.</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/2">The mischief that the new schedule seeks to attack is the business whereby big companies exercise the option to tax on a piece of land, build a storage facility and later disapply the option to tax, giving themselves a tax advantage. The Treasury have applied VAT on all self-storage and my concern is that some 250,000 people in the UK use self-storage and will find from September onwards that their bills will suddenly go up by 20%. I hope that the Government will consider this a little further and think whether there is a better way to deal with the real mischief, which is the abuse of the option to tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/3">My other concern is that the revenue raised will disproportionately benefit larger businesses that can claim back costs under the capital goods scheme, rather than the smaller businesses, which cannot. Effectively, it will disproportionately benefit the four big players in the self-storage industry at the expense of smaller businesses such as A and S Self Storage. I hope that Ministers will consider that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/4">The Exchequer impact is also in question. The Exchequer says that the measure will raise money, but the Self Storage Association&#8217;s brief states:</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/5">&#8220;In its calculations the Government has not taken into account the significant reclaim of VAT under the CGS rules, which Deloitte have calculated to be &#163;43m based on the detailed results of their survey&#8230;According to Deloitte many operators, particularly the largest ones, could accelerate CGS recovery under existing VAT law.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/6">I want to plead for caution on the part of Ministers and ask them to consider carefully the question of tackling the underlying abuse, which is the business of disapplying</p>
	<p pid="c.818.0/7">the option to tax. I appreciate that many Members will find that exceptionally dull, as it involves highly technical VAT law, but my principal concern is that it is a hard thing to raise VAT across the board for 250,000 people when one really wants to target the few people who are playing the system to get more tax money for their businesses at the expense of everyone else and of the UK Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="c.819.0/1">It is a great pleasure to respond to the debate. I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton), for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy), for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert), for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills) and for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) for their remarks. In many cases it has been a pleasure to work closely with them on some of the Budget measures that we have discussed. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay for his kind remarks. I am grateful for the courteous and constructive way in which he engaged with us, and I am grateful also to my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and Falmouth and, although he is not here, to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40141" name="George Eustice">the Member for Camborne and Redruth (George Eustice)</phrase>, who were very involved in these matters. [Hon. Members: &#8220;He is here.&#8221;] I am delighted to see that he has joined us. Even if I did not know he was here, I would have said something nice about him. He can assess my sincerity on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Dover made a point about the capital goods scheme. I think he was otherwise engaged earlier today, but I confirm to the House that we are making a separate provision by statutory instrument to amend the capital goods scheme so that self-storage providers affected by the measure and whose individual capital items are worth less than the &#163;250,000 threshold for the scheme can opt in to the scheme and have the same input tax recovery benefits as larger providers with capital items that would already qualify for it. My hon. Friend can note that within two minutes of his making a request, the Government have acceded to it. I hope he is pleased with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/3">I want to pick up on some of the points made and say a word or two about some of the new clauses. I think the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> is addressing in new clause 3 is the funding of sixth-form colleges, as opposed to whether they are charged for VAT. Sixth-form and further education colleges are under the control of local authorities and have always been funded differently from schools or academy schools. I think he has in mind a refund scheme along the lines of that for academies.</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/4">Sixth-form colleges have never been able to receive VAT refunds against expenditure on their non-business activities, but the basic funding principle for sixth-form colleges is that their VAT costs are taken into account within their up-front funding allocation. Thus funding for sixth-form colleges includes cover for various costs, including VAT, on top of the direct costs of teaching. The right hon. Gentleman has put his argument on the record. Essentially, he argues for additional funding for sixth-form colleges. That must be assessed in light of the current fiscal situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/5">New clause 10, which requires an assessment of the impact of the VAT borderline changes, is virtually identical to new clause 3, which was debated and defeated</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/6">in the Committee of the whole House on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-18">18 April</phrase>, and to amendment 200, which was withdrawn in the Public Bill Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-21">21 June</phrase>. Given that the amendment was debated and defeated the first time and withdrawn the second time, I suggest that the Opposition withdraw new clause 10 on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/7">On new clause 12, the Opposition have tabled an amendment to return the rate of VAT to 17.5% until</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/8">&#8220;such time as the Government presents to Parliament a report stating that the UK economy has returned to strong growth.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.819.0/9">This would be very costly. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> was keen not to provide a cost to the House, but the proposal would cost &#163;12 billion to &#163;13 billion. That would substantially erode our fiscal credibility, and if credibility is lost and interest rates rise, the impact on the fiscal position would be severe. We would expect this to have a negative effect on the UK economy. If the Opposition believe that the answer to our current problems is more borrowing, they should stand up and say so. If the solution that the economy needs is a bigger gap between what we raise in tax and what we spend, let me give the hon. Lady the opportunity to say that now.</p>

	<p pid="c.820.0/1">Is the Minister aware that the overall borrowing that the Government are engaged in is &#163;9 billion higher now than was planned in October 2010, so the Government&#8217;s own economic strategy is resulting in higher, not lower, borrowing?</p>

	<p pid="c.820.1/1">I am not sure whether the hon. Lady welcomes that. Does she support more borrowing or not? The Institute for Fiscal Studies has made its position clear on what would happen if we pursued the policies that the Opposition advocate or have advocated&#8212;that moves around a bit. It stretches the Opposition&#8217;s credibility if they think that their approach means that borrowing now would be lower. I think the sincere position of the Opposition is that we should have a bigger fiscal stimulus&#8212;we should be borrowing more now in order to pump money into the economy. Is that their position?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.820.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" speakername="Catherine McKinnell" colnum="820"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#120703128001380">
	<p pid="c.820.2/1">The Opposition&#8217;s point is that the Government&#8217;s own plans are resulting in more borrowing. The alternative is to give a 2.5% VAT cut to households to stimulate demand in the economy and get the economy out of the double-dip recession that it is in and back into growth, which will ultimately bring borrowing down.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.820.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="820"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#120703128001381">
	<p pid="c.820.3/1">So when borrowing is higher than we plan it to be, it is a disaster, but when borrowing is higher because the Opposition would bring that about through a deliberate policy, that would be a fiscal stimulus. I am not entirely clear where they are trying to go with this. We know why the public finances are more difficult than we had anticipated. It is to do with the eurozone, the increase in commodity prices and the fact that the economy took a bigger hit than anyone had previously realised, but a discretionary fiscal loosening of &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion, which is what the Opposition are about to vote on, would be taking a huge risk with our credibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.820.3/2">It is worth making the point that if we do that, we lose our fiscal credibility and we are likely to see long-term interest rates rise. That will result in our paying out</p>
	<p pid="c.820.3/3">more in debt interest. A one-point rise in interest rates would mean &#163;7.5 billion in additional debt interest payments by 2016-17, and an increase for the average mortgage borrower of &#163;1,000 per year. Is that what the Opposition want? Do they think that would help?</p>

	<p pid="c.821.0/1">The Minister should accept that he has given a partial quotation from his own Office for Budget Responsibility. He is fond of saying that the recession has been deeper than previously thought. Yes, the OBR did say that, but it also said at exactly the same time that the climb out of that recession had been faster than had previously been thought. That was a result of the economic stimulus measures that the previous Government put in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.821.1/1">The OBR was very clear about the reasons why the economy did not grow as quickly as it had predicted. That was not because of the measures that we had taken to clamp down on borrowing. It was because of the factors that it set out. Now, at a time when we see other countries without fiscal credibility facing enormous difficulties, the Opposition want a discretional fiscal loosening of &#163;12 billion or &#163;13 billion a year. That is not responsible opposition. That is not a responsible policy and it is not a policy that this Government will pursue. I urge the Opposition not to press new clause 10.</p>
	<p pid="c.821.1/2">I note that the Opposition are also opposing the VAT measures in total. That would be an additional cost of &#163;210 million. These are measures that will remove anomalies. We have listened to the concerns raised by hon. Members and others to improve what we initially set out.</p>

	<p pid="c.821.5/1">After the changes we have announced, the Budget remains fiscally neutral. The reality is that the &#163;70 million we are talking about has to be compared with the policy of cutting VAT, which would cost between &#163;12 billion and &#163;13 billion, and the &#163;210 million for refusing to go ahead with the VAT changes we have announced.

It is an understatement that this has not been a good few weeks for the banks. First, there were the disgraceful mistakes at Royal Bank of Scotland that left thousands of people unable to access their own money for up to a week. I am sure that top bankers there managed to get by for a few days, but for people on low incomes it is no laughing matter to be left without a week&#8217;s wages.</p>

	<p pid="c.835.3/1">I was talking about the situation at RBS, which was caused by a total administrative meltdown and computer failure; it had nothing to do with regulation. On the subject of regulation, Conservative Members called for less regulation. Politicians on both sides of the House need to consider where we go from here.</p>

	<p pid="c.835.4/1">Whatever people say about the banks&#8217; responsibility for things that happened in the past, there can be no doubt that what has happened at RBS in the past few days is the responsibility of people running the bank now and of those responsible for the financial sector now, who include the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.835.4/2">It is not just those on low incomes who suffer from the damage caused by the difficulties at RBS, which obviously is trying its best to resolve them. Businesses in my constituency have contacted me saying that if the problem is not resolved immediately, they face closure. The Government need to take that issue seriously, but clearly they are not.</p>

	<p pid="c.835.5/1">I absolutely agree with those sentiments. When discussing the impact that the total administrative failure at RBS had had, particularly on those on low wages but also, as my hon. Friend has just said, on small businesses, I was shocked and taken aback at the political opportunism involved in jumping up and raising a question about regulation, which is entirely irrelevant to the matter that I was discussing.</p>

	<p pid="c.836.4/1">My hon. Friend sums up in a nutshell why I am speaking in favour of the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.4/2">The shocking revelations from Barclays this week are nothing short of a scandal. Barclays&#8212;along with we do not know how many other banks now under investigation &#8212;broke the rules to make a profit and put global economic stability at risk. It played fast and loose with rates that affect people&#8217;s mortgages and credit cards and, it would appear, gave little thought to how people could be affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.4/3">In another shocking scandal, we found out that thousands of small businesses had been sold expensive insurance products that they did not need and could not use, spending money, which could have been used to protect jobs, to pay for products that never should have been offered to them in the first place. How many businesses have lost out as a result? All those actions on the part of the banks were totally unacceptable. The banks have been taking without giving back. The Government can take action now to put the situation right.</p>

	<p pid="c.836.5/1">I thank the hon. Lady for being so generous in giving way. I agree that the Government should take action to address some of the issues that have been raised.

	<p pid="c.836.6/1">Members of the public will find this distasteful. We all share concern about the situation with the banks and the terrible events that have come to light in the past week or so. Government Members should be taking the lead on putting the situation right, but all they are interested in is scoring party political</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/2">points. They need to be careful if they are not to lose all the public&#8217;s trust in their ability to start putting things right.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/3">The Government can take action today. Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, has rightly said that he will decline his bonus this year in recognition of the serious damage that his bank has caused. Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, resigned this morning over the currently developing scandal. It is right that those in charge take responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/4">However, the banking industry as a whole is still benefiting from a tax cut this year&#8212;a tax cut, when their incompetence has cost thousands of people days of frustration, inconvenience and hardship. They have a tax cut when champagne swaps and dodgy dealing have been used to fiddle internal lending rates and when small businesses have been ripped off in yet another mis-selling scandal.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/5">Our bank bonus tax would set that right, making the banks pay their fair share in tax instead of letting them get away with it. We want the money to be used to create 100,000 jobs for young people who are risk of becoming the next victims of this double-dip recession made in Downing street. Labour&#8217;s bank payroll tax raised &#163;3.5 billion in 2010-11 but this Government replaced it in 2011-12 with a levy raising just &#163;1.8 million&#8212;barely more than half. Those are the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s own figures, set out on page 101 of its economic and fiscal outlook paper in March this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/6">The autumn statement in November last year had forecast a higher first take, but that turned out to be over-optimistic. That could be the case with future forecasts. The levy is supposed to raise &#163;2.8 billion in 2014-15, but we cannot be sure of getting that. The OBR has had to keep revising all forecasts down and down, apart from those for Government borrowing, which keep going up and up. It is clearly inadequate to introduce a levy on banks with only half the yield of the previous tax. Along with the richest 1% of the country who have benefited from the scrapping of the 50p tax rate, this is one of the only parts of the Budget where the Government have given handouts. What does that tell us about their priorities? It tells us that they are not on the side of working people hit by the banks&#8217; recent malpractice, but on the side of banks and millionaires. That shows just how out of touch this Government are.</p>
	<p pid="c.836.6/7">We want to take tough measures to make the banks pay their way, and bringing back the bonus tax on top of the new levy is the fairest way to do that. It is clear where that extra money needs to go. We would use our double bank tax to plug the gaping hole in jobs and growth left by the Chancellor&#8217;s omnishambles of a Budget, which contained not one mention of the word &#8220;jobs&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.837.1/1">It is nice to receive a considered intervention from a Conservative Member. The 100,000 jobs would be created through support from the future jobs fund. They would be guaranteed jobs paid at the national minimum wage for six months to give young people a real chance of getting on to the employment ladder.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/2">This is about not only providing those jobs but creating economic growth and putting money into people&#8217;s pockets to create those opportunities. That aspect was absent from the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget speech, which is all the more shocking because of the seriousness of the problem. At Christmas, the number of young unemployed people reached 1 million for the first time since comparable records began, and long-term youth unemployment is rocketing too. Across the UK, the number of people aged 24 and under who are claiming out-of-work benefits for more than six months has increased by 60% since May 2010, while the number claiming for more than 12 months has more than doubled by over 125%. In this double-dip recession, young people cannot find work because between five and 10 people are chasing every vacancy. Depending on which part of the country they are in, it could be, and often is, a lot worse. The jobs are simply not there for young people to go into.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/3">Yet the Government recklessly cancelled the very programme that was designed to create youth jobs. We want to use money raised from banks to put that right. In opposition, the Government supported Labour&#8217;s future jobs fund, which got young people into real, paid jobs. The Prime Minister called it &#8220;a good scheme&#8221;, and the Conservatives said that they had</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/4">&#8220;no plans to change existing Future Jobs Fund commitments&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/5">I apologise to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> for my response to his intervention; in fact, it is through the real jobs guarantee that we would look to invest in new job opportunities for 100,000 young people. The future jobs fund was the successful scheme that the Prime Minister heralded as &#8220;a good scheme&#8221; but it was scrapped as soon as this Government took power.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/6">I see that no Liberal Democrats are here for this debate. That is a crying shame and a shocking indictment of their commitment to young people and to making sure that bankers pay their way. The Liberal Democrats also pledged their support to the future jobs fund but swiftly supported the Government in scrapping it as soon as they got into power. In April 2010, in a letter to the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, their then work and pensions spokesperson &#8212;now the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>&#8212;said:</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/7">&#8220;We have no plans to change or reduce existing government commitments to the Future Jobs Fund. We believe that more help is needed for young people, not less&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/8">The future jobs fund was scrapped just one month after that letter was sent.</p>
	<p pid="c.837.1/9">Let us remind ourselves of what that scheme achieved. It offered every young person up to the age of 25 a job if they had been out of work for six months, with penalties for anyone who refused the opportunity. The jobs were real jobs, paid at the minimum wage, that lasted for six months&#8212;and that was guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid="c.839.0/1">I absolutely agree. It is not just about giving opportunities to young people where so few exist, but about this desperately concerning period in which we risk creating an entire lost generation, because young people are coming out of school, higher education and college and finding no opportunities at the other end. Once they fail to get on to the ladder of work and opportunities, the consequences can be long term and cause a lifetime of damage. The Government need to factor that in and grasp it now before it is too late to make sure that these opportunities are provided and that too many young people do not miss out. That is why it is so important that we use this opportunity to make sure that the bankers who caused much of the global economic and financial meltdown take responsibility for that and pay their way, giving young people real chances and opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="c.839.1/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful case for repeating the bank bonus tax. Does she agree that the Government should be considering the evidence from the 1980s about the effect that long spells of youth unemployment had on young people and how hard it was for many of them ever to find decent jobs and catch up? As a result of the Government&#8217;s delay and refusal to adopt this policy, they are in grave danger of repeating exactly the same mistakes, with all the misery that that will cause.</p>

	<p pid="c.839.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful intervention and reminds me particularly of my own region, the north-east, where too many people lost out on opportunities in the 1980s and never quite recovered from the experience. When I talk to young people today, I find that some of the brightest are coming out of school and choosing not to go to university or college but instead to try desperately to find whatever work opportunities might be available to them because, apart from the fact that they are put off by the tuition fees, they are so worried that if they did step on the ladder and go to university they would come out at the end to find there were still no opportunities. There is a deep sense of anxiety among young people that the Government need to be seriously aware of.</p>
	<p pid="c.839.2/2">That is what is so concerning about the scrapping of the future jobs fund, which was not only providing real opportunities for young people and breaking the cycles of lack of opportunity, but helping businesses to open up and take on young people in particular. The Government replaced it with the work experience scheme, which they eventually rolled out last year and which offers only eight-week, unpaid placements. There is nothing to say that that is not valuable in itself, but it is simply not doing enough for enough young people. It is also available only for people under 21, so it does not cover unemployed people who have left further or higher education. Again, that compounds some of the anxieties that young people are expressing to me when they say that if they go on to college or university they will be no better offer at the end and they will instead be saddled with a lifetime of debt.</p>

	<p pid="c.839.3/1">It is worth remembering, is it not, that this younger age group, who will no longer be getting jobs under the future jobs fund, but only its successor, will also be one of the main targets of the Government&#8217;s cuts in welfare benefits?</p>

	<p pid="c.840.0/1">Yes. I think that we all shuddered when we heard the proposals put forward by the Prime Minister which will mean that under 25-year-olds must either live at home or become homeless.</p>
	<p pid="c.840.0/2">The youth contract, which was introduced only in April this year&#8212;too little, too late&#8212;offers very little extra, with no guarantee of a job, no guarantee of the minimum wage, but what the Government call &#8220;personalised support&#8221;, which we know from leaks could be little more than a weekly text message.</p>
	<p pid="c.840.0/3">I am surprised that Government Members are not jumping up to proclaim the Government&#8217;s success with apprenticeships. Even with apprenticeships, it is difficult to believe the figures on the tin, particularly after McDonald&#8217;s recently revealed that it had spent &#163;10 million of Government funding but had not created a single new job. The money was used to fund career progression for existing staff. That may be a worthy aim, but this is not the dawn of the apprenticeship revolution that the Government would have us believe.</p>

	<p pid="c.840.4/2">It is clear that we need action on jobs for young people. The bank bonus tax would bring in the money that is needed to create the real, paid jobs that will give under-25s the start that they need to get into the job market. That money could put &#163;100,000 young people into jobs. Austerity on its own clearly cannot do that. The cuts are going too far and too fast, are choking off the recovery and are making it harder for people to get into work. We need an extra stimulus.</p>
	<p pid="c.840.4/3">Rather than give the banks a tax cut this year, we want to make them pay their fair share of tax. We would use that money to give young people the start that the Government&#8217;s hotch-potch of schemes is failing to provide. That is what the new clause would achieve and I urge hon.

The bank bonus tax and the bank levy have a different ethos or philosophy. The original bonus tax&#8212;Members will correct me if I am wrong&#8212;was intended to be a one-off measure.

	<p pid="c.841.5/2">The Government&#8217;s bank levy is the right way forward because if we take too much money out of the banking system, we will be pulling out capital. If we pull out too much capital through taxation&#8212;or, indeed, through dividends&#8212;we will constrain the ability of the banks to lend. We have a crisis in which banks are not lending because they are hoarding capital. If we pull more capital out of the banking system, it will constrain the granting of mortgages and loans to small businesses. In my constituency, that is an important issue, because many small businesses are having great difficulty in getting the lending that they need.</p>

It rose significantly in the last Parliament under the previous Government, who completely mismanaged the economy.

All of us are, of course, concerned about unemployment and want to see more jobs and money. That is why we need</p>

	<p pid="c.842.0/1">I am little unclear about the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s position. He is against taking money out of the banks in the form of a bank bonus tax because it would affect the capital that they can lend to businesses. I think that is a fair assessment of his position. However, that criticism also applies to the bank levy that his Government are in favour of. How is it that he is in favour of a bank levy that takes capital out of banks, but against a bank bonus tax that is paid for by the people who get the bonuses?</p>

	<p pid="c.842.1/1">My position is that the bank levy strikes the right balance. That is why I asked the shadow Minister whether her proposal would be in addition to, or an alternative to, the bank levy. That is significant.

That would have an immediate effect on the capital that banks can lend to small businesses and hard-pressed home owners.</p>

	<p pid="c.842.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is simply suggesting that we give with one hand and take away with the other. He might think that he can throw lots of money at dealing with the problem of youth unemployment, but he would meanwhile be constraining businesses in getting the capital that they need to create new jobs and maintain their existing jobs. That is the central flaw in the Opposition&#8217;s argument. They want to take more money out of the banking system when capital and lending are already constrained.</p>
	<p pid="c.842.3/2">The issue that we need to deal with is bonuses. The Government have taken action on bonuses in the taxpayer-owned banks. They have said that there will be no cash bonuses of more than &#163;2,000 at the taxpayer-owned banks. It is right to have longer-term share incentivisation schemes, which align people&#8217;s interests with the success of the banks over the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="c.842.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is developing an interesting argument. Does he agree that bonuses have been too high not just in the state-owned banks but in the privately owned banks, and that shareholders should do their duty and exercise some control over bonus pots? Bonuses have been paid in banks, such as Barclays, that performance has clearly not justified.</p>

	<p pid="c.842.5/1">Shareholders have been exercising control. Under this Government we have seen the shareholder spring and real action by institutional investors to restrain pay in the boardroom, which grew so much under the previous Government. Under the current Government, there has been action to ensure that shareholders have</p>
	<p pid="c.842.5/2">far greater power over remuneration reports and can push down the excessive rewards that have been given for not enough success.</p>
	<p pid="c.842.5/3">It is right that an honest day&#8217;s work means an honest day&#8217;s pay and really good work deserves really good pay, but it is fundamentally wrong to say that the Government have not taken action. They have encouraged shareholders to do their bit as business owners to ensure that we do not have the excessive pay of yesteryear. A responsible Opposition would say, &#8220;We congratulate the Government on ensuring that excessive pay is stopped, and we take responsibility for the fact that when we were in government, we allowed a something-for-nothing culture in which everyone knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.&#8221; We need an understanding of the value of things once again. The Government have got it right by saying that there will not be excessive bonuses in the taxpayer-owned banks. Although the Project Merlin agreement was not perfect, it was a move in the right direction, as is the permanent bank levy that the Government have introduced, which raises &#163;2.5 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.842.5/4">The Opposition would have us believe that their bank bonus levy raised more money than the coalition&#8217;s bank levy, but that does not quite stack up, does it? The gross receipts from the Labour Government&#8217;s bank bonus tax were &#163;3.45 billion, but the net yield was estimated to be more like &#163;2.3 billion. The explanation for that was given by Lord Sassoon in a detailed written answer to Lord Myners. Under the current Government&#8212;Ministers will correct me if I have got it wrong&#8212;the permanent bank levy raises about &#163;2.5 billion, which is more money than Labour&#8217;s levy. I would have thought the Opposition would welcome that.</p>

	<p pid="c.843.1/3">a previous written answer. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.843.1/4">&#8220;In line with guidance from the Office for National Statistics, the yield from the bank payroll tax was allocated to the 2010-11 tax year, as this is the point at which the tax was passed into legislation.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-01-20.57"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>20 January 2011; Vol. 724, c.

The Government set up the OBR as an independent organisation to give such figures, so I am absolutely amazed that he will not rely on it. That is nearly double the amount raised by the current bank levy in its first year, and significantly more than is predicted for coming years.

	<p pid="c.845.1/2">The Opposition are saying, it seems, that we should take more money out of the banking system, but that would be irresponsible because it would constrain banks&#8217; ability to lend. The Opposition use Barclays as an excuse to blame everything on greedy traders manipulating the LIBOR interest rate. I would urge caution, however, because I have looked through some of the internal documents floating around, particularly the note of a conversation involving Paul Tucker of the Bank of England. If I may, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall briefly read it to the House by way of scene-setting and to demonstrate the Opposition&#8217;s mischievousness in seeking to impose this tax.</p>

	<p pid="c.845.3/1">It is indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker, because a key part of the Opposition&#8217;s rationale for the new clause is that what happened at Barclays was so disgraceful that we need to punish the bankers. A large part of the shadow Minister&#8217;s argument is that these bankers are outrageous and we need to impose a tax. My point, however, is that we need to consider the wider picture. I am particularly concerned about the comments concerning what the previous Government did on regulation as well as tax. It says here:</p>
	<p pid="c.845.3/2">&#8220;Mr Tucker stated the levels of calls he was receiving from Whitehall were senior and that, while he was certain that we did not need advice, that it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.845.3/3">It seems it was not only greedy bankers manipulating the interest rates and putting pressure on the LIBOR interest recording; it seems more clearly to have gone to the heart of government and to have been sanctioned by Downing street, according to some comments on the internet. When we talk about how to tax the banks, we need to consider how to get more lending and ensure responsible banking with incentives for the long term. We also need to ensure that members of the previous Government accept their responsibility for the Barclays scandal, the LIBOR situation and their own behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.845.4/1">The information that the hon.

The scandal that has unfolded this week has highlighted the contribution that the banks made to the financial collapse and the collapse of the banks, which led to the economic recession that we have suffered.

	<p pid="c.846.2/1">New clause 13 is extremely important and deals with the bank bonus tax for youth jobs. It is an admirable new clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/2">It is indisputable that the financial services industry is an essential part of our economy, but equally, there must be an acceptance that the industry&#8212;the banks and the financial institutions&#8212;needs to pay its way. The June 2010 Budget announced that a levy based on banks&#8217; balance sheets would be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>. Labour supports the bank levy, but we want to go further. We want to repeat the bankers&#8217; bonus tax, which brought in an estimated &#163;3.5 billion. We can argue about net and gross, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase> explained; however, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, the bankers&#8217; bonus tax brought in &#163;3.5 billion. Despite slight increases in the rate of the levy, the Government&#8217;s failure to repeat Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax&#8212;and, in the meantime, create more than 100,000 jobs for young people&#8212;means that the banks simply received tax cuts last year and will do so in future years. It is wholly unacceptable, when we have a double-dip recession, for us to allow banks off with fortunes and tax cuts year on year.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/3">In the last financial year, the amount raised by the bank levy was just over half the amount raised by Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax&#8212;&#163;1.8 billion, compared with &#163;3.5 billion. The Chancellor&#8217;s spending review plans have simply failed. The Government&#8217;s austerity measures have led to the flatlining of growth in the economy, resulting in long-term youth unemployment spiralling to record levels. In the last year it has gone up by 112%, while the number of young people out of work for over a year has gone up even more, by around 156%. That is the result of the Government scrapping the future jobs fund, immediately after they came to power, without putting a viable alternative in place. They had no idea what would replace the fund or how on earth they would be able to create any employment, for young people in particular. The Work programme started only a year later, in June 2011, and we all know now, from people coming to our surgeries, about the difficulties that the workfare and other programmes have created.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/4">That is why we are calling for Labour&#8217;s youth jobs guarantee, which would redress the Government&#8217;s scrapping of the future jobs fund. On a cautious estimate, we believe that the bank bonus tax could raise at least &#163;2 billion this year, which the Government could use to</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/5">build thousands of affordable homes and introduce the real jobs guarantee for young people who are long-term unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/6">As part of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan for jobs and growth, the real jobs guarantee would cost &#163;600 million, and would provide a six-month job for every 18 to 24-year-old who had been on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance for 12 months or more. We estimate that it could assist up to 110,000 people in that category. The Government would pay full wages directly to the business, which would cover 25 hours of work per week at the minimum wage. That would equate to about &#163;4,000 per job. In return, the employer would be expected to cover the young person&#8217;s training and development for a minimum of 10 hours a week. The ultimate objective would be the opportunity of a permanent job at the end of the six months. New clause 13 would tackle the issue of youth unemployment, and make the banks pay their way.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/7">The banking industry has been in the news for all the wrong reasons over the past few days. Bob Diamond has resigned from Barclays, only days after the bank was fined a record &#163;290 million for attempting to manipulate the inter-bank lending rate known as LIBOR. A simpler explanation of that activity would be to call it corporate fiddling. In my constituency, young people aged 24 under whose only crime is to be unemployed in area that has few job opportunities are being threatened with losing their entitlement to benefit. Let us compare that with Mr Diamond&#8217;s situation. He has been the chief executive of a bank that has been fined a record &#163;290 million for attempting to manipulate interest rates. It will be extremely interesting to see what sort of gold-plated handshake he receives following his timely resignation. I am sure that he will walk away with a fair amount, leaving him an even more extremely wealthy man than he is already.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/8">Figures published by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility show that last year&#8217;s bank bonus tax raised &#163;3.5 billion, which is considerably more than the &#163;2.3 billion that the Tories claim it raised. Cautious estimates show that the bank bonus tax could raise in excess of &#163;2 billion this year. What an opportunity for jobs and growth. What an opportunity for 100,000-plus young people to gain some form of employment. We should grasp that opportunity with both hands, but we can see what the situation really is.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/9">The money from the banks could be used to build thousands of affordable homes, which would provide a much-needed boost to our construction industry. It could be used for investment in infrastructure such as school buildings. Investment in school buildings is much needed at several schools in my constituency. I have visited numerous schools there in the past two or three months and, believe me, we have some fine teachers, some fine staff and some fantastic pupils, but we cannot use those words to describe the facilities in which they are working.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/10">We would introduce the real jobs guarantee for long-term unemployed young people. Such an initiative would be welcomed in my constituency and throughout the north-east. It would be a significant step because, believe me, there are many young people in Wansbeck and the</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/11">north-east who have never had the opportunity of any employment. That is the harsh reality. Sadly, in communities throughout my constituency, we continue to feel the effects of the coalition Government&#8217;s economic policy as the number of people out of work continues to rise at the same time as job opportunities reduce. Under this Government, youth unemployment is our only growth industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/12">On a country and regional basis, the highest rates of unemployment are in the north-east, standing at 11.3%. Over the last year, the greatest rise in the International Labour Organisation unemployment rate was also in the north-east&#8212;up 1.8 percentage points. Between February and April 2012, 1.01 million people aged 16 to 24 were unemployed&#8212;a rise of 119,000 compared with the same quarter only a year ago. The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 is 21.9% of all economically active people in this age group&#8212;an increase of 2.6 percentage points on the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/13">In my constituency, the official figures show that the number of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants aged 24 and under has increased by 22.4% in the last year. The number of JSA claimants per jobcentre vacancy is 15, but in large parts of Wansbeck the figure is in excess of 50 people going for each vacancy. These figures do not include the hundreds of jobs lost with the closure of Rio Tinto Alcan, nor the huge number of jobs in the supply chain that will be lost. They do not include either those who will lose their jobs as a consequence of the coalition&#8217;s attack on the public sector; in my constituency, 53% of those employed work in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/14">Within those horrendous statistics are a huge number of young people who are denied the opportunity of employment, many of them, of course, women. With in excess of 1 million young people unemployed, the only proposals the Prime Minister can come up with are threatening to remove access to housing benefit for those aged 16 to 24, and trying to prevent school leavers from claiming benefits straight away. Surely if we can see it, he can see it: this is not the answer, whereas providing jobs and opportunities for our young people is the answer. The number of young people out of work for over a year has gone up 156%. Why did the Government scrap the future jobs fund immediately after they came to power without a viable alternative in place? That decision was driven purely by ideology.</p>
	<p pid="c.846.2/15">I invite the Prime Minister to my constituency to see the effects of his Government&#8217;s economic incompetence on my constituents and, in particular, on those young people denied employment opportunities. Then again, I am not sure whether that would be a good idea. Labour&#8217;s five-point plan means job creation and a redistribution of wealth from those who want more to those who need more. We need to repeat Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax and invest in real jobs and in real jobs guarantees.</p>

	<p pid="c.849.0/1">A good point, Madam Deputy Speaker. I suspect that my hon. Friend might repeat some of my points, as we Labour Members have robust arguments in support of the bank bonus tax in new clause 13, to which I am delighted to lend my support this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.0/2">Given the dramatic events at Barclays over the past few days, it is particularly apposite to be discussing the contribution of the banks to the well-being of our economy and how to deal with the excessive bonus culture in the financial services sector. Our position on this issue has been clear and consistent: bonuses should be exceptional payments paid for exceptional performance. Far too many highly paid bankers, however, continue to be paid astronomical bonuses, often seemingly with little or no connection to meeting their performance targets. While such excessive and unjustifiable bonuses remain, the case for a tax on bank bonuses is strong and undoubtedly popular with the public. The LIBOR scandal at Barclays will cause the banks&#8217; reputation to plummet to a new low. Few would have believed that the public&#8217;s opinion of them could get any worse, but they manage to keep coming up with inventive new ways of further undermining the trust of their customers and the wider population.</p>

	<p pid="c.849.1/1">My hon. Friend has made an important point about the popularity of a tax on bank bonuses with the public, but the tax should not just be popular; it should also work. Nothing that Government have done has remotely worked, and those failures&#8212;including their failure in regard to bank lending&#8212;are the real reason why this is the right thing to do.</p>

	<p pid="c.849.5/1">The problem with the banks seems to be that they will not lend because they are frightened, and they are frightened because they must have money themselves.

	<p pid="c.849.6/1">That is a valid point, with which I shall deal shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/2">The strength of the balance sheets and the corporate reputation of our banks are crucial building blocks enabling us to restore confidence in the economy and return to growth. However, I am afraid that the Prime Minister&#8217;s limited parliamentary inquiry into what happened at Barclays will not command the confidence of the public, or be regarded as an adequate response to the catalogue of failings and scandals that have befallen our banks in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/3">The full public inquiry into banking standards that has been called for by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition would be the most effective way of demonstrating to the public that both politicians and those in the industry are serious about ending unacceptable practices and taking steps to restore faith in our banking system. A repeat of the bank bonus tax would help to reassure the public that bankers are making amends for their part in our current economic woes by helping young people to return to work and enabling new homes to be built.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/4">I know that many Government Members believe that the bankers have been let off lightly in regard to bonuses and paying their fair share towards recovery. Senior Government figures have talked tough on bank bonuses, but have stopped short of taking meaningful action. Indeed, rather than ensuring that bankers made a bigger contribution, the Chancellor gave them a massive tax cut in the Budget, as a result of which the richest bankers will pay millions less in tax from next April. As Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Commission, said when the new 45p rate was announced:</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/5">&#8220;This tax cut for bankers will be galling for the millions of pensioners who will see their bills go up because of this Budget.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/6">As well as the reduction in the personal tax paid by bankers, the Chancellor&#8217;s cuts in corporation tax mean the banks received a tax cut last year and will do so again in future years. Despite the Chancellor&#8217;s slight increase in the rate of the bank levy in January this year and 2013, the Government&#8217;s failure to repeat the bank bonus tax leaves the banks considerably better off, while our constituents face cuts in tax credits, higher living costs and a squeeze on millions of pensions.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.6/7">At the same time, small businesses across the UK continue to struggle to access the lending they desperately need to grow and create jobs, with lending to SMEs having fallen by more than &#163;9.5 billion last year.</p>

	<p pid="c.850.1/1">That may be the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s opinion, but I reiterate the point that, because of the Government&#8217;s policies of the past two years, the official figures show that banks lent &#163;9.5 billion less to SMEs last year than in the previous year, so there is a problem now.</p>

	<p pid="c.850.2/1">My hon. Friend is right about the poor state of bank lending, but the reality is that the banks are not lending because they have no confidence; they have no confidence in this Government because they have pushed us back into a double-dip recession. That is the reality, and that is why action is needed. That is why this</p>

	<p pid="c.851.0/1">I agree. I am sure that many Members have been contacted by SMEs based in their constituencies who are desperate because they cannot attract as much lending from the banks and other financial institutions as they enjoyed a number of years ago. While many are critical of the lending banks, they are also critical of Government policy. Members on the Government Benches may not agree with that, but it is the reality, and that is why people are approaching us with these complaints and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.0/2">The continued failure on lending is making a mockery of the Chancellor&#8217;s promise to link the pay of the chief executives of each bank with performance against SME lending targets, but there is now another chance for Members on the Government Benches to demonstrate to their constituents that they are genuine about making bankers pay their fair share. Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax raised about &#163;3.5 billion, as confirmed by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> said, even on a cautious estimate, we believe that this year alone it could raise at least &#163;2 billion, over and above what is already in place. The Government could use those funds to introduce the real jobs guarantee for young people who are long-term unemployed, potentially helping 100,000 into work. It could also be used to build thousands of much-needed new affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.0/3">In conclusion, by supporting the new clause hon. Members can show that we are serious about holding bankers to account and ensuring that they pay their fair share, while also raising additional funds to address the people&#8217;s priorities&#8212;youth jobs and affordable homes&#8212;and make a real contribution to turning around our ailing economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.851.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40075" speakername="Rushanara Ali" colnum="851"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#120703140000033">
	<p pid="c.851.1/1">I support the new clause because today more than 1 million of our young people&#8212;one in five of them&#8212;have no job. That is not because they are not trying to find work and it is not because they are not working hard to get experience and skills; it is because in this flagging economy&#8212;in this double-dip recession created by this Government&#8217;s failed economic policies&#8212;the jobs just are not there. Yet, at the same time, we see the banks paying out huge bonuses to some of those responsible for the economic mess we are in. Britain is now bottom of the pile for social mobility, and that is due to this Government&#8217;s failures. The top 1% of our society now control a greater share of the national income than at any time since the 1930s. Despite these crippling inequalities, this Government&#8217;s priority has been to give tax breaks to millionaires while building their austerity programme on the backs of some of the poorest in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/2">The current labour market is a bleak place. The hardest hit by unemployment remain women and older people, who face discrimination in the labour market, and of course young people. Long-term unemployment is at its highest since 1996. As my hon. Friends have already said, youth unemployment has increased by more than 100% in the past year. That is a travesty, because it means</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/3">that we have failed to help young people live up to their ambitions and find the jobs they want&#8212;or, indeed, find any jobs at all. It also means that a great wealth of talent and productivity is being lost. That is a travesty, too, and one this Government should be ashamed of. According to a recent Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations report, that will cost the Treasury &#163;4.8 billion this year and it will cost the economy &#163;10.7 billion in lost output. I support the new clause because the Government&#8217;s plans are driving a wedge through our society, leaving too many people behind.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/4">Social mobility in this country has ground to a halt, and as I represent one of the most deprived areas of London, I see that all too clearly; it has always been hard, but now we are moving backwards. Every week, I meet young people in my constituency who are losing out. My area has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment, at more than 8%. The loss of the education maintenance allowance is making it harder for these young people to stay on in school. The lack of jobs makes it seem like the rising cost of university or education is just not worth it. Georgia Rowe, a student at one of the colleges in Tower Hamlets, recently said to me:</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/5">&#8220;I thought about university but it doesn&#8217;t guarantee a better job. You might as well not be in debt.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/6">This is the generation of young people who are being left behind.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/7">That is why Labour has proposed the real jobs guarantee to help give our young people a chance, as we know the scarring effects that long periods of unemployment can have. People need work experience, training and to learn the skills that make them more employable in today&#8217;s difficult labour market. I know what a massive difference it can make to a young person&#8217;s chances if they get a little experience. Programmes such as Job Ready, which is hosted by Futureversity in my constituency, and Skillsmatch, and those of the Adab Trust and City Gateway, along with access to a job, can help people overcome the psychological barriers to economic opportunity, and build ambition and confidence. They connect business and young people, opening up new opportunities and partnerships, but those programmes are all struggling without adequate support.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/8">The Work Foundation has rightly called the Government&#8217;s approach to youth unemployment &#8220;piecemeal&#8221; and &#8220;fragmented&#8221;. The Government&#8217;s headline plan to get young people back into work through the Work programme and youth contract is failing. They have managed to get only about a third of those on the programme into jobs, and in this age of austerity that is not good enough. Recent figures in my constituency showed that at least 15 people were chasing every job vacancy. The Government should be looking for real ways to help solve these problems and not continuing to kill off jobs and growth prospects through their draconian austerity measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/9">Young people in my constituency can see the opportunities a short distance away in Canary Wharf and the City of London. They want to know how to get jobs there. They see bankers in the city getting tens of thousands of pounds in bonuses while unemployment soars. This is what happens when social mobility grinds to a halt. Those kids in my constituency, who are as talented and aspirational as any others, simply do not</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/10">have the same opportunities, so it does not seem like such a bad idea to ask those who have so much to pay a little more.</p>
	<p pid="c.851.1/11">When I consider the behaviour of the banks and some of their employees, I do not always see shining examples of socially responsible companies. The finance sector is a vital part of our economy and many companies and their staff behave responsibly, but too many of the highest paid behave the worst, as we have seen with the Barclays bank scandal. Such behaviour is at best reprehensible and at worst criminal and requires inquiries and investigations as soon as possible, yet those people are some of the highest paid in the country. Bob Diamond earned 600 times more than the average income in my constituency, so a tax on the excessive bonuses received by people such as him is only too fair. But instead the Government are reducing the tax paid by banks, with the bank levy raising just over half as much in 2011-12 as Labour&#8217;s bank bonus tax would have raised this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.853.0/1">I was interested to hear my hon. Friend say that Bob Diamond&#8217;s bonus and salary were 600 times the average wage in her constituency and want to highlight that point. Most of us understand that top bankers will probably be paid a lot more than most people in the country under any system, but such a discrepancy is obscene. That is what people find so disgusting and what they want to see tackled.</p>

	<p pid="c.853.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and hope that the Government are listening. They must understand how serious the matter is and the deep resentment and anger that is felt in constituencies such as mine. The borough that contains my constituency is also the borough in which Canary Wharf is based and the injustice of some of the behaviour and the worst abuses in the banking sector must be addressed. The Government must take responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.853.2/1">It is very decent of the hon. Lady to give way. When she refers to figures that are 600 times a normal wage or to huge bonuses, at least there is compensation.

	<p pid="c.853.3/1">The hon. Gentleman should perhaps look at the tax records of Barclays bank, as he will find that it has not paid the taxation that it should have paid. His Government should do more to ensure that the taxes that should be paid are paid. I also think that his Government has a poverty of ambition in not accepting our amendment to make a massive difference to unemployment in constituencies such as mine. I urge the Government to think hard about the impact on the 1 million young people&#8212;a sizable number of whom are in my constituency&#8212;and consider what could be done to address the problem rather than trying to defend bankers&#8217; bonuses.</p>

	<p pid="c.855.4/1">I would like to begin my remarks on new clause 13 by agreeing with so much of what has been said today by Opposition colleagues. I want briefly to take the House back a couple of years to 2010, when I was lucky enough to secure an Adjournment debate on young people and unemployment, the first such debate I led in the House. For me, it could not have been on a more important subject than the position of young people in the labour market in my constituency. I do not wish to put myself forward as some kind of Cassandra or some awful foreseer of what has come about, but I warned the Minister then that the swift withdrawal of some of the more successful things the Labour Government had been doing to tackle young people&#8217;s unemployment would lead to more young people being on the dole. Sadly, that is what has happened. In fact, two years later the ONS tells us that an extra 65,000 16 to 24-year-olds are now without work. That is not just a waste of talent and funds, but a moral shame.</p>
	<p pid="c.855.4/2">I want to say a few words on that subject and why new clause 13 is so important to young people facing that difficult situation. The Government have had two years to tackle the problem, yet all of us here have to admit that the problem is getting worse, not better, and that action is needed more today than it was in 2010. The Government would not listen then; I beg them to listen now.</p>

	<p pid="c.856.0/1">My hon. Friend has a proud record, before and since reaching this place, of advocating for young people and employment. She is quite right to draw attention to the Government&#8217;s record. We should remember that we saw the same thing happen in the &#8217;90s. The Government are going back to exactly the same failed policies of the &#8217;90s. The difference between Government and Opposition Members is that when we were in government we looked after unemployment. We kept unemployment, repossessions and business failures low. Under this lot they have gone up and we are seeing the problems for young people, which is why we need the action we are debating right now.</p>

	<p pid="c.856.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend and neighbour in Merseyside for his intervention. He is quite right. The return to things such as the youth training scheme has been one of the most unfortunate aspects of the Government&#8217;s work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.856.2/1">The hon. Lady makes the important point that youth unemployment is deeply regrettable and has been rising recently, but she skips over the fact that youth unemployment has been rising since 2004, so most of the period of that rise actually occurred on her watch when the kinds of policies she is advocating were clearly not working.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.856.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" speakername="Alison McGovern" colnum="856"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#1207042000658">
	<p pid="c.856.3/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to be careful about apportioning blame, because although we have seen an extreme rise in youth unemployment over the past couple of years because of the recession&#8212;I will move on to the problem of demand in the economy later&#8212;under the Labour Government there was successful action to prevent levels of youth unemployment from rising to those we saw in the &#8217;90s. If he wishes to, we can talk at length in the Chamber on another occasion about some of the structural reasons for young people&#8217;s unemployment, such as how skills are transferred in different ways, how small businesses recruit differently, which hits younger people more than it does those with experience in the economy, and why those patterns were starting to emerge from 2005. However, in new clause 13 we are trying to establish the urgency of getting money from a particular source and prioritising the needs of young people in my constituency and in his.</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/2">The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations has done an important piece of work to calculate the cost to the Exchequer of young people being out of work, and, although I hope that Treasury Ministers will have already heard the figures that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40075" name="Rushanara Ali">the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali)</phrase> cited, I want to alight on this one. If youth unemployment continues at current rates, by 2022 the cost to the Exchequer and to the economy in lost output is estimated to be &#163;28 billion&#8212;on top of the human and social costs. That is a huge figure, and we as a country cannot afford to see this crisis continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/3">I shall take a few moments, however, to consider not only the financial cost, huge and important though that is, but the impact of the crisis on individuals, on their pride and on their self-worth. I mentioned earlier the Government&#8217;s own research, carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions, into the future jobs fund, and if Ministers have not read it they would do well to do so. The research, first, considered the impact on young people who took part in the future jobs fund programme, and it is a shame that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase> has left his place, because I wanted to ask him&#8212;I tried to intervene on him to do so&#8212;whether he had met, spoken to or asked the opinion of any young person who took part in the future jobs fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/4">Just in case hon. Members have not had the opportunity to read the research, however, I shall quote a young person and how they were feeling prior to the introduction of the future jobs fund. They said that they were</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/5">&#8220;feeling a bit low. I was about four and half, five months, unemployed and I thought &#8216;oh no, this isn&#8217;t good&#8217;. Most employers I spoke to, it was like if you&#8217;ve been unemployed for more than 2 months, it really puts people off. I knew how to do a job; it&#8217;s just the fact that I&#8217;d been unemployed for nearly 5 months. Almost half a year, which was quite embarrassing really. I know there was nothing out there, but it was still kind of embarrassing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/6">Despite this person realising that aggregate demand and low job vacancy numbers had caused their problem, they blamed themselves, so I ask hon. Members to consider the impact of low self-esteem and poor mental health on the extra 65,000 young people who have become unemployed since 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/7">The research, secondly, asked young people how they felt about their work once they had taken part in a future jobs fund employment placement, and to me the following quotation says it all. On the question of what the most important gain was, one person said:</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/8">&#8220;Trust in my determination. Self belief, the belief from my employer that I am able to succeed&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.856.3/9">What more important thing could anybody have for success in life than self-belief? When people are left to languish on the dole, such self-esteem is undermined every single day.</p>

	<p pid="c.857.0/1">I strongly admire the sincerity of the hon. Lady&#8217;s compassion for those people, but I am not sure that reading out two or three vox pops necessarily adds to the intellectual coherence and probity of the argument. She admitted a moment ago that youth unemployment was dangerously high during the Labour years. It remains very high, and we are very worried about that, but what does she actually propose we should do about it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.857.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40662" speakername="Alison McGovern" colnum="857"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#1207042000660">
	<p pid="c.857.1/1">I am not sure I know where to start. I am reading out the testimony of young people who have been unemployed. That is not some kind of media vox pop; it is an example of real people who have been affected by the phenomena that we have been talking about, and we should listen to them. If the hon. Gentleman does not want to listen to what I have to say, let him listen to young people in my constituency and in his own, and to how they feel about being thrown on the scrapheap.</p>
	<p pid="c.857.1/2">I shall briefly discuss bankers&#8217; bonuses, and why the measure before us is an entirely appropriate one to take in order to fund for young people employment that will</p>
	<p pid="c.857.1/3">stand them in good stead for the rest of their careers. Profit-making banks have had a reduction in corporation tax, but I shall not go over the reasons why the tax in question is an appropriate one to levy on their payroll. We have to face the fact that in the City of London we have seen behaviour that cannot be tolerated. For the sake of the future of our young people, what is needed now is some sort of restorative justice to rebalance people&#8217;s ability to make a good life for themselves. Young people in this country are facing a more difficult labour market than they have for many years. I beg the Government to listen and take some action now.</p>

	<p pid="c.858.3/1">I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak in this debate and to follow my hon. Friends the Members for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) and for Livingston, and indeed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase>, who served on the Public Bill Committee. He is not in his place at the moment, but I found his contribution interesting, as always.</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/2">I support new clause 13, tabled by the Opposition Front-Bench team, which would introduce a bankers bonus tax to fund a job guarantee for every young person who has been out of work for more than 12 months. History will judge this Budget as chaotic. It has been a Budget of U-turns&#8212;on pasties, on caravans, on skips and on charities. It should be remembered as a Budget for &#8220;millionaires row&#8221;&#8212;admittedly, that is a little sparse at the moment&#8212;but I hope it will not be remembered as the Budget that let the greedy bankers off the hook. Tonight, I want to put on the record the impact on the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/3">The north-east requires an alternative vision for economic confidence, growth and jobs. The proposals in new clause 13 of a guaranteed paid job for people who have been out of work for 12 months, as suggested by the Institute of Public Policy Research North, would boost the process of regeneration that is so badly needed in my region. According to economists at IPPR North, coalition spending cuts have worsened the impact on our region&#8217;s economy and added to unemployment&#8212;especially youth unemployment&#8212;in the north-east. Well over 32,000 public sector jobs have been cut. I remind the House that unemployment in my region stands at 11.3%; 145,000 people are out of work. The private sector-led recovery that was promised has clearly not materialised in my region, at least, and a recent report from Northern TUC shows declining employment in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/4">In the Public Bill Committee, I gave some examples of the private sector haemorrhaging jobs in my constituency, and I do not propose to repeat that tonight. The problem</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/5">we face&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, raised this point&#8212;is that money is being sucked out of the region through public spending cuts, benefit cuts and the slashing of regeneration and infrastructure projects, worsening the economic problems. The Government, through their policies, are squeezing out demand from the regional and national economies. That is counter-productive, as it pushes up both the benefits bill and Government borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/6">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor pretend that there is no alternative, but the Opposition recognise that politics is about priorities and making choices. Sadly, the Chancellor has chosen to give a &#163;40,000 tax cut to 14,000 millionaires, while more and more people in my area are losing their jobs and young people in particular have little prospect of finding paid employment. He has also chosen to keep VAT, a deeply regressive tax that hurts the poor, at 20%.</p>
	<p pid="c.858.3/7">IPPR North has said that business confidence is failing. The lack of confidence among employers has created a hire freeze across the north that looks likely to get worse. The unwillingness of employers to take on permanent staff only increases economic insecurity for ordinary households. Where vacancies do exist, they are often for low paid and insecure work. Given that more than 1 million young people are out of work, we need real action from the Government to stop the next generation from wasting away on unemployment benefits. That is where the real jobs guarantee comes in. We need to offer a jobs guarantee, especially to young people, to stimulate the economy and offer personal hope to each individual.</p>

	<p pid="c.859.0/1">General Government expenditure accounts for 50% of the economy, our debts are at record levels and we have the highest deficits. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the answer to debt, deficit and the Government&#8217;s massive share of the economy is for the Government to do more or to do less?</p>

	<p pid="c.859.1/1">I would have more respect for the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s intervention if he had sat through the whole debate, because those points have been raised. It is beholden on the Government to do more, not less; we have to learn from the lessons of history. I urge hon. Members to support new clause 13.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.859.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="859"  time="021:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0003.htm#1207042000667">
	<p pid="c.859.2/1">I want to say a few words in support of a bank bonus tax. I emphasise that I am supporting that not to bash the bankers, but to end the unacceptable face of banking in the form of an excessive bonus culture that is still far too widespread.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/2">As I said earlier, the vast majority of people who work in financial services certainly do not get vast bonuses; many thousands of people in my constituency work hard behind bank counters or in bank offices serving customers, and they are often on modest incomes. Many have paid with changes in working conditions, while others have paid with their jobs, when redundancies flowed from the financial crisis caused by the irresponsibility of senior executives. We are not targeting those people; we want to do something about the small minority who are still getting excessive rewards.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/3">A study published at the end of June showed that average pay for chief executives at 15 leading banks in the US and Europe increased by 12% over the last financial year. That may be less than the 36% increase in the previous year, but whatever the increase&#8212;it is about 50% when we add both increases&#8212;it is wildly out of line with falls in profits and share prices that have frequently characterised the sector. That is not performance-related pay in any sense that most people would understand and it is certainly not a performance that would justify what is effectively a further tax cut on top of a tax cut for the highest paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/4">A tax targeted on bank bonuses is necessary because the existing attempts to curb the bonus culture have so obviously failed. That is the key point. The issue is not about saying that people should not be very well paid at the top of banks and financial institutions, but we want to get away from a position in which sums wildly in excess of anything that could be said to be deserved are paid as a matter of course. None of the steps taken so far has changed that culture, even in an era of financial crisis among the banks and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/5">The second reason why we want a bank bonus tax is that it would raise money for some valuable purposes. The issue of jobs for young people affects all our constituencies. My constituency normally comes in the middle range of unemployment across the UK, and we have seen a substantial increase in youth unemployment. I certainly want that issue to be tackled in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/6">We are also saying that the bank bonus tax would be used to provide affordable housing. That, of course, would bring two benefits. First, it would bring more housing into the sector. Constituencies such as mine have to some extent, although on a lesser scale, experienced the same phenomenon as happened in London, where high rates of pay in certain sectors such as financial services have pushed up house prices and made it harder for people on lower incomes to get affordable housing, so this proposal would be important for those people as well. Of course, building affordable housing and new homes also gives a boost to the economy through providing new jobs in the construction sector and helps people who have been out of work because of the collapse of that sector in many parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.859.2/7">Our proposal of a bank bonus tax would not only tackle the excessive bonus culture but provide jobs for our young people and affordable homes, giving a boost to the construction sector. I therefore hope that the House will support it.</p>

	<p pid="c.860.0/1">We have heard a series of slightly strange speeches by Labour Members. We have become accustomed to their belief that they left us a golden economic legacy, but the reality is that when they left office unemployment was higher than when they came into office. They seem to believe that the problems of youth unemployment started under this Government. At least <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the right hon.

	<p pid="c.861.1/1">The challenge that we face is dealing with the economic legacy left by Labour, with the huge boom in financial services and the huge bust that followed.</p>
	<p pid="c.861.1/2">We have heard Labour Members&#8217; story that they presided over a golden age in the financial services sector. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> could not bring herself to admit that the scandal over LIBOR fixing took place between 2005 and 2008 or that the interest rate mis-selling that affected so many small businesses took place in the same period leading up to the financial crisis.</p>
	<p pid="c.861.1/3">Labour Members deplore the bonus culture, but let us not forget that when they were in government, bonuses were paid out in the year that they were earned and paid out in cash. That was the hallmark of the age of irresponsibility that characterised their time in office. This Government are taking action to tackle the bonus culture. This Government have introduced rules to ensure that bonuses are not paid out in the year they are earned but spread over a three-year period, that they are not paid out in cash but in shares, and, crucially, that they can be clawed back where there have been problems in the business or where there has been wrongdoing. This Government have tackled the bonus culture in the UK whereas the previous Government let it run riot, and we have seen the financial consequences of their so doing.</p>

	<p pid="c.861.4/1">The bank bonus tax was first introduced by the previous Government. In fact, I think that our Government should have done much more about the bonus culture in the banks in the past and was wrong not to do so. However, will the Minister at least accept that at no stage did his Government suggest any action whatsoever to tackle the bonus culture? He should not suggest that the responsibility lies only with Labour but accept his share of the responsibility as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.861.5/1">We have taken action to tackle the bonus culture by ensuring that the interests of shareholders and management are aligned and that where there is wrongdoing bonuses can be clawed back. That is a significant change that has happened since this Government came to office. In the same way that we are remedying the regulatory failures left behind by the previous Government, particularly by the shadow Chancellor, the inquiry set up into the fixing of LIBOR will ensure that in future LIBOR is regulated to fill the hole in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and ensure that there are criminal penalties for manipulating LIBOR&#8212;again, filling the hole left by the shadow Chancellor when he designed the regulatory system.</p>

We said that they were tinkering around the edges and did not address the fundamental problems at the heart of regulation.

	<p pid="c.862.8/1">The last Prime Minister had a problem recognising his responsibility for the problems that befell the economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/2">One way in which we have sought to get the balance right in the taxation of businesses is by introducing the bank levy. We took that decision in opposition. We thought that it was right to ensure that banks paid their fair share towards dealing with the risks that they pose to the economy. The measure was opposed by the previous Government. They did not want to introduce a bank levy on a unilateral basis. We had the courage to make that decision and to ensure that banks pay their fair share.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/3">The bank levy is a tax on the balance sheets of banking groups and building societies. It complements the wider regulatory reforms that are aimed at improving financial stability, such as the higher capital and liquidity standards. It thereby ensures that the banking sector makes a fair and substantial contribution that reflects the risks that it poses to the financial system and the wider economy. The levy is also intended to encourage banks to move away from risky funding models.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/4">From the outset, the Government have been clear that we intend the levy to raise at least &#163;2.5 billion each year. The Opposition should get their facts right. They have trotted out the gross figure that was raised by the bank payroll tax. They must bear in mind that the tax also reduced pay-as-you-earn and national insurance receipts. That is why the actual yield of the bank payroll tax was only &#163;2.3 billion. Our levy will therefore raise more, year after year, than was raised by their one-off bank payroll tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/5">The target yield for the levy was set out in the Government&#8217;s first Budget. We also announced our intention to make significant cuts to the main rate of corporation tax. Let me deal with another red herring from the Opposition. We were clear at that time, as we are now, that the bank levy yield will far outweigh the benefits that banks will receive from the corporation tax changes. Other sectors, including manufacturing, will benefit from the reduction in corporation tax, but banks will not benefit because of the bank levy. In the 2011 and 2012 Budgets, the Chancellor has gone further and announced two more cuts in the main rate of corporation tax. It now stands at 24%. The increase in the bank levy announced in the Budget offsets the benefit of those additional cuts to maintain the incentives on banks to move towards less risky funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/6">New clause 13, tabled by the shadow Chancellor, is, in the words of Yogi Berra, the great American baseball coach,</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/7">&#8220;d&#233;j&#224; vu all over again&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/8">This is at least the fifth time in this Parliament and the second time in the passage of the Finance Bill that we have debated the bank payroll tax. We have heard no new arguments from the Opposition and nothing to persuade us to vote for it.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/9">Yet again, we have to point out to the Labour party that such a tax would be counter-productive and unnecessary. The bank payroll tax was introduced as a one-off interim measure in the last Parliament ahead of regulatory reforms and changes to remuneration practice and corporate governance. The previous Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>&#8212;somebody the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North should listen to and learn from&#8212;said that it could not be repeated. He pointed out that it was a temporary measure until bank remuneration practices were changed, and we have changed those practices.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/10">The new clause calls for the proceeds of the tax to be used to help employment, but I should take some time to remind the House of the measures that we are already taking to do that. We have introduced the youth contract and are investing &#163;1 billion over the next three years in supporting half a million young people into employment and educational opportunities. We will provide</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/11">160,000 wage incentives worth up to &#163;2,275 each to employers who recruit an 18 to 24-year-old through the Work programme. There will be an extra quarter of a million voluntary work experience or sector work academy places over the next three years and a further 20,000 incentive payments to encourage employers to take on young apprentices, taking the total to 40,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/12">We are also providing additional support through Jobcentre Plus and the opportunity for people to be referred for a careers interview with the national careers service. We are already providing more apprenticeship places than any previous Government, with a record 457,000 apprenticeships delivered in 2010-11 and a commitment to delivering 1.2 million over the entire spending review period. That is a quarter of a million more than the previous Government&#8217;s commitment.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/13">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North says that the bank payroll tax should be used to help youth employment, but let us consider the number of ways the Labour party has already announced it would be used. The Leader of the Opposition was asked where the money would come from to reverse the increase in VAT, and he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/14">&#8220;I said for example we should have a higher bank levy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/15">It was also suggested that it be used to pay for higher capital spending of about &#163;7.5 billion in 2010, which would have required &#163;6 billion from the bank levy. The Leader of the Opposition said that reversing child benefit changes could be afforded by using the bank payroll tax&#8212;yet another use for it.</p>
	<p pid="c.862.8/16">The bank payroll tax is the tax that continues to give, the tax that the Opposition always turn to when they want to find a way of plugging the black hole in their figures. They used it to explain how they would reverse tax credit savings, spend more money on the regional growth fund, cut the deficit and turn empty shops into community centres. We have heard a remarkable number of ways in which something that the previous Government said was a one-off would be used to fill the black hole in Labour&#8217;s economic thinking.</p>

	<p pid="c.864.2/1">We have heard some passionate speeches from Labour Members, but I am concerned about the lack of contributions from Government Members. Only one, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase>, contributed in the entire debate. He put forward some interesting views and theories, and I commend him for engaging in the debate, because there is little of more importance right now than youth unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.864.2/2">The hon. Gentleman concluded his speech, however, by hailing a return to the 1980s. I do not know about other Opposition Members, but it sent a shudder of</p>
	<p pid="c.864.2/3">fear through me, because although some people had the time of their lives in the 1980s&#8212;we have fond images of the City, the champagne flowing, the pinstripe suits and the brick-sized mobile phones&#8212;for many the 1980s were not pleasant or a time of growth but devastating, particularly for youth unemployment. Parts of the UK, including my region of the north-east, other English regions, Scotland and Wales, suffered dreadful decimation of their traditional manufacturing industries, and in many ways are still paying the price. We risk repeating that fate today, which is why we are proposing to impose a bank payroll tax on the very institutions that played a large part in causing the international financial crisis that led first to the recession and then to today&#8217;s double-dip recession.</p>

	<p pid="c.865.5/1">No, we have clear plans: we would like to spend the bank payroll tax on creating youth jobs. I would have thought that Government Members would have grasped that opportunity, given that short-term unemployment is up 112% and long-term unemployment is up 156%. I would have thought that Conservative Members would be shouting out for any solution to bring those figures down.</p>
	<p pid="c.865.5/2">Or are Government Members happy to see another generation of young people thrown on to the scrap heap with no opportunities and no way out? The future jobs fund gave opportunities to young people. It was heralded by the Prime Minister as a good scheme and promises were made not to scrap it, but as soon as the Government took office it was put in the bin. And we have seen little put in its place: the work experience scheme, for which we waited a whole year, is producing very few results.</p>
	<p pid="c.865.5/3">For that reason, we are proposing a solution. On a cautious estimate, we believe that this year the bank bonus tax could raise at least &#163;2 billion, which the Government could use to create thousands of affordable homes and introduce a real jobs guarantee for long-term unemployed young people. As part of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan for jobs and growth, the real jobs guarantee would cost &#163;600 million&#8212;a small price to pay for tackling the chronic youth unemployment about which Labour Members have spoken passionately this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.865.5/4">Under the real jobs guarantee, the Government would pay full wages directly to businesses&#8212;again something I would have thought Government Members would have supported&#8212;and support businesses taking on new members of staff. It would cover 25 hours of work at the minimum wage&#8212;&#163;4,000 per job&#8212;and in return the employer would cover the training requirements and the young people would be required to take the jobs made available. It would be a genuine contract and a real jobs guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="c.865.5/5">We cannot stand by and watch another generation of young people left to suffer the effects of this double-dip recession, which is why we propose this bank bonus tax as a real solution and why I urge hon. Members to vote for the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="c.872.4/1">Members will recall that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility revealed that the underlying damage to the economy and our challenge in repairing it was much greater than anyone had thought. It was therefore vital for us to take decisive action to restore the economic stability that was needed for recovery, and the Bill is part of that. In order to address the enormous</p>
	<p pid="c.872.4/2">debts that we inherited, confront Britain&#8217;s problems and get the economy moving, the Government have undertaken a sustained programme of deficit reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.4/3">As I said earlier, the Bill supports business and growth. It implements milestones for the corporation tax roadmap, overhauls the controlled foreign companies regime, and introduces the patent box.</p>

	<p pid="c.873.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the controlled foreign companies regime. I support the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure that all the tax that must be paid in the UK is paid in the UK, but, as he knows, concern has been expressed about the possibility that by introducing these rules the Government will inadvertently harm small developing countries which may lose tax revenue. I hope that they will ensure that there is no such side effect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.873.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="873"  time="022:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0004.htm#1207044000082">
	<p pid="c.873.1/1">We debated that in the Committee of the whole House. The purpose of the CFC rules is to protect the UK tax base, as has always been the case, but the Government have a proud record of supporting developing countries, and we have a firm commitment to meeting our international obligations on that front. This country also has a proud record of building capacity in developing countries and improving their ability to collect taxes. In many developing countries, the UK has already made a substantial contribution, and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/2">Both the patent box and the CFC changes form part of the Government&#8217;s wider plans, which will help UK businesses to operate in an increasingly globalised world. I am sure all Members agree that those measures are essential to restore medium and long-term growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/3">Despite the challenging economic backdrop that the Government inherited, we have made significant progress. We have already introduced a further cut in the rate of corporation tax that will give us the lowest rate in the G7, the fourth lowest rate in the G20, and the lowest rate that this country has ever known. By next year, the Government will have cut corporation tax by 6%, helping to make the UK the most competitive country in the G20. According to the OBR&#8217;s assessment of the Budget, the reduction will increase the level of business investment by about 1% by the end of the forecast period. That is equivalent to an increase in the total amount of business investment of &#163;3.4 billion between now and 2016.</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/4">Many businesses have seen that we are, as promised, open for business. WPP and others have recently announced that they are considering returning to the UK, or that they wish to set up business here. I am delighted to say that Rowan and Lancashire have already come here, and once the CFC rules are in place in 2013, we shall be looking for more businesses to follow them. Following the Bill&#8217;s publication in March, one of the big four advisory firms announced that it was engaged in discussions with between 10 and 15 multinational companies that were considering locating substantial operations in Britain as a result of corporate tax reforms. The CBI has commented that these much-needed changes</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/5">&#8220;will help make the UK a more attractive place for companies to invest, do business and create jobs.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/6">The Government aim to create a tax system that is easy to understand and with which it is easy to comply, and the Bill contributes to that. It provides real help for families and business. It raises the personal allowance</p>
	<p pid="c.873.1/7">to &#163;8,105&#8212;which, curiously, was not mentioned very frequently in Committee&#8212;and, combined with the further increase of &#163;1,100 next year, will mean a tax cut for 24 million people and 2 million people being taken out of income tax altogether.</p>

	<p pid="c.874.2/1">The Minister was waxing lyrical about simplification, and I was wondering whether he has reconsidered his view as to whether the proposed child benefit reform creates simplification or complication.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.874.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="874"  time="022:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0004.htm#1207044000086">
	<p pid="c.874.3/1">If we do not want people earning &#163;20,000, &#163;25,000 or &#163;30,000 a year to be paying for benefits to go to much wealthier households, the alternative would be an extension of the tax credit system. That would have placed a much greater burden both on households and the Government. Of the available alternatives, we have gone for the simpler option.</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/2">We are deferring the 3p per litre duty increase that was planned for August to January next year. Action by this Government to reduce the deficit and rebuild the economy is already benefiting businesses and families and keeping mortgage rates low. As hon. Members know, this Government have also had to make difficult decisions so we can tackle the deficit left to us by the previous Administration. They include withdrawing child benefit from households earning more than &#163;50,000. That is a fair way to make savings, so we can meet our targets to cut the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/3">We are also taking steps to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share too. The Budget package ensures that the wealthiest will pay five times more than the cost of reducing the additional rate of income tax. The introduction of a new higher rate of stamp duty land tax of 7% on properties sold for more than &#163;2 million will raise over &#163;1 billion in the next five years. At the same time, this Government are also tackling avoidance, as demonstrated in the Bill. The new SDLT enveloping entry charge rate of 15% will deter those seeking to put their high-value property into corporate structures to avoid tax. Also, debt buy-back measures will raise over &#163;500 million from banks that try to avoid paying the tax due, and the introduction of the UK-Switzerland agreement will ensure we can address the tax loss from those who put their money into Swiss banks to evade tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/4">There has been extensive scrutiny of this Bill, including about 44 hours in Public Bill Committee. From looking at some of the new clauses tabled for today, I am happy to see that the Opposition continue to stick to their same theme on this Bill, which is to ask for reports, rather than focusing on policies. We have seen 34 Opposition-requested reports over the last 10 weeks, but no real policy alternatives. Yesterday, we were discussing Groucho Marx, and I wonder if the Opposition ever needed to be reminded of the quote:</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/5">&#8220;The problem with doing nothing is that you never know when you are finished.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/6">In order to make progress with Government business in good time, we agreed with the Opposition, through the usual channels, to programme parts of this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.874.3/7">It is a delight to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> once again in his usual place. As he rightly said yesterday, this legislation is the body, soul and guts of this Budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.875.2/1">It is very generous of the Minister to give way.

	<p pid="c.875.3/1">This Government have taken tough decisions to bring the deficit down, and we are sticking to that plan even though some Opposition Members would rather give up on deficit reduction and continue to borrow in the same unsustainable way that we borrowed up until 2010. This Government remain determined to stick to that plan. I thank the hon. Lady for giving me the opportunity to underline that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.875.3/2">I thank all those who have been involved in every stage of this Bill, including both Front Benchers and Back Benchers engaged in this matter, not to mention various others. I wish briefly to mention a couple of Treasury officials. First, I congratulate Mr Edward Troup, who, as announced earlier this week, has accepted the post of tax assurance commissioner and second permanent secretary at Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. His wealth of experience and enthusiasm will be a great asset for HMRC, but a sad loss to the Treasury. I also thank Jamie Miller, who has been the Bill manager for this Bill, and indeed has served on the past six Bills over the past four years. Despite that, he has remained remarkably cheerful, notwithstanding the provocation that all of us have given on that front.</p>
	<p pid="c.875.3/3">In conclusion, this is a good Bill that builds a stronger and more balanced economy. It will strengthen the UK, making us more competitive and more ready to face the challenges ahead, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.875.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" speakername="Rachel Reeves" colnum="875"  time="022:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0004.htm#1207044000091">
	<p pid="c.875.4/1">I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Pontypridd (Owen Smith), for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) and for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson) and others for serving on the Public Bill Committee with me over the past several weeks. I also thank our able Chairs for supervising us during that process and the Commons Clerks for their advice and assistance throughout the process in Committee and in the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/2">The Bill has been on quite a journey since it was first presented to the House just a few months ago. I fear that the Exchequer Secretary spoke too soon last December when he announced that</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/3">&#8220;the Government&#8217;s more open, predictable and simple approach to tax policy making is working well.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/4">He said that by publishing tax legislation in draft form first,</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/5">&#8220;we are giving greater certainty and stability to taxpayers and businesses&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/6">I do not think that taxpayers and businesses, or indeed Members of this House, realised that the Finance Bill itself was still only a draft when it was published in March. This Finance Bill has been through so many stages of crossing out and rewriting that it would have been easier for the Government to have scrapped it and started again, perhaps with some measures that would have supported jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.875.4/7">As we have heard throughout the Committee and Report stages, the Budget has been a total and utter shambles. When we first saw this Bill back in March, it contained provisions to raise VAT on hot food, on static caravans and on improvements to listed buildings.</p>

	<p pid="c.876.0/1">What was in the Budget back in March was a consultation exercise on VAT on static caravans and so on. I am glad that after that exercise the Government listened and amended their proposals, but it was a consultation. This Government, unlike the previous one, listen to what people say in consultations.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.876.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" speakername="Rachel Reeves" colnum="876"  time="022:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0004.htm#1207044000093">
	<p pid="c.876.1/1">That is the first time I have heard a Finance Bill being called a consultation&#8212;I do not even know where to start.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/2">The Budget in March also included a 3p rise in fuel duty in August and limits on charitable donations. All this was necessary, we were told, to deal with the deficit. Yet the Bill before us, as we reach Third Reading, contains none of those measures. We have had a series of abrupt reversals that, according to one estimate, will cost the Exchequer nearly &#163;700 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/3">Opposition Members argued that these measures were misconceived from the start, and that adding to the costs faced by families and small business at this time would make it even harder for our economy to climb out of the recession that this Government have dug us into. But it must be a matter of regret that so much uncertainty and confusion has been created for those affected, doing real damage to businesses, charities, pensioners and families, and that at a time of tight public finances the Government&#8217;s financial and fiscal planning seems to be in such disarray, with no one at all clear what the Government&#8217;s priorities actually are.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/4">Despite the Government&#8217;s belated change of heart on those matters, the Bill remains a deeply flawed, unfair and utterly inadequate response to the problems facing our country today and that is why the Opposition will vote against it this evening. The Bill still offends against the most basic principles of fairness by giving priority to a reckless and irresponsible tax cut worth tens of thousands of pounds for a few thousand millionaires while at the same time asking millions of ordinary people who are already under pressure from rising prices, falling wages and cuts to tax credits and benefits to make further sacrifices and endure further hardship.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/5">The Bill breaks a promise that the Chancellor made in the Budget last year to Britain&#8217;s pensioners that their age-related allowance would rise in line with inflation for the rest of this Parliament and instead imposes a stealth tax that will hit 4.5 million people over the age of 65, all of whom live on modest pension savings. The Bill is breaking the principle of universal child benefit and still means that one-earner families will lose thousands of pounds a year while a two-earner family on almost twice as much will keep all their benefit. It is a botched, half-baked measure dreamt up for a party conference speech but the measures are described by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales as a &#8220;policy disaster&#8221; that are</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/6">&#8220;in danger of becoming a practical disaster when they come into effect&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/7">We have raised a number of other concerns about the Bill, such as the controlled foreign companies changes and the impact that they will have on developing countries. What is most wrong with the Bill, however, is that it represents a massive missed opportunity to end the recession and get our economy working for ordinary working families, pensioners, businesses and young people. It could have been a Bill that took the tough decisions necessary to ensure that those who could make a fair contribution to deficit reduction did so, so that those hit hardest by the current crisis were not put under even more pressure.</p>
	<p pid="c.876.1/8">It could have been a Bill that cut VAT, giving immediate relief to hard-pressed families and giving our economy the stimulus it needs to get growth under way again and to make unemployment fall. It could have been a Bill that redirected money wasted on excessive bank bonuses and put those resources to better use, helping young people get back to work and constructing new affordable homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.877.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, but there is a little problem with her maths.

	<p pid="c.877.3/1">We have seen that this Government&#8217;s plan has failed, as unemployment remains far too high, with a million young people out of work. It has failed, and the economy is back in recession&#8212;we are one of only two countries in the G20 that are in recession&#8212;and the Government are borrowing more. In fact, in the first two quarters of this financial year, the Government are borrowing &#163;4 billion more than they were last year. Their plan has failed and it is time to try an alternative that gets the economy moving again and that gets people back to work and paying taxes so that the economy can grow and the deficit can be brought down sustainably.</p>
	<p pid="c.877.3/2">We have proposed a bank bonus tax because we think that it is right that those people with the broadest shoulders should pay a little more. On the day that Bob Diamond has resigned after taking &#163;100 million of bonuses in just a few years, would it not have been far better tonight if we had supported the bank bonus tax and used that money to fund a programme of youth jobs to get our economy working again?</p>
	<p pid="c.877.3/3">We could have used the Budget and the Government could have used the Finance Bill properly to accelerate infrastructure investment to help the struggling construction industry and to create much needed jobs in our economy. Instead, we have a Bill that will go down in history as a monument to this Government&#8217;s incompetence, complacency and inability to grasp that what the current economic situation demands is a Government who stand up for ordinary working people. The Bill fails on fairness and asks millions to pay more so that millionaires can pay less. It fails to address the real challenges that this country faces&#8212;a recession made in Downing street and a Government with no plan to get us out of it.</p>

	<p pid="c.878.0/1">Before I turn to the broad sweep of the Bill, I want to mention again clause 180, to which the Minister referred in his winding-up speech in response to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase>. Many of us will have been written to by a coalition of charities such as Christian Aid and ActionAid, with which I have been working closely on the effects of the clause. The reason for that concern is felt internationally. The OECD has estimated that developing countries lose three times the amount of aid that they receive from developed countries through tax avoidance in their own countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.0/2">In 2011, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the OECD came together and said that the G20 countries have an obligation to ensure the smooth running of the international tax system. It was therefore appropriate for G20 countries to undertake spill-over analyses of proposed changes to their own tax systems and the possible impact of those changes on the fiscal circumstances of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.878.2/1">If the hon. Lady was so interested, she could have studied the <i>Hansard</i> record of the debate. The purpose of my amendment at that stage of the Bill was to probe the intentions of the Government and to get on the record statements from my hon. Friend the Minister that the Treasury and the Department for International Development were going to work more closely together. The hon. Lady&#8217;s party made it clear that it would not support my amendment in order not to hold up that controlled foreign companies change going through. I suggest that she has a word with her Front-Bench team.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/2">I move on to new clause 6, which I tabled. Because of the length of time spent once again discussing the bank bonus levy and Labour&#8217;s five-point plan, we did not get to it this evening. Perhaps the hon. Lady might like to think about why that was the case. New clause 6 called</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/3">for joined-up working between the Treasury and the Department for International Development. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, I and many other hon. Members and Members of the House of Lords were in Committee Room 14 this morning to listen to President Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Irish President Mary Robinson, three of the Elders, who were talking about human rights and in particular developing nations. They specifically praised the record of this Government as the first major Government in the world to reach the 0.7% target for overseas aid. I urge upon my colleagues in Government again that we build upon that achievement by making sure that our aid is well spent and raises the capacity of overseas Governments to develop their own tax collection capability so that they are not so dependent on us in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/4">As others wish to speak, I turn to the wider measures in the Bill. For those of us who have been on the entire journey, it has been a long trip from the Budget to Second Reading, to Committee of the whole House, to 18 sittings of the Committee, and to the past two days. Some of the things that were there at the start did not make it all the way through to the end. Maybe somewhere in Cornwall there is someone sitting in a caravan, eating a pasty washed down by sports drinks, filling in a gift aid form, perhaps to a church restoration fund. Such a person ought to be happy that this Government listen.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/5">Some things, to be fair, were consistent all the way through that process. We heard them again this evening from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase>&#8212;Labour&#8217;s five-point plan. As a boy, I was brought up to go to Sunday school, so I cannot help but be reminded of the parable of the feeding of the 5,000; they start off with such a small amount and expect it to achieve so many things, but without the benefit of miraculous intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/6">When all these measures are long forgotten, having simply been about tens of millions or hundreds of millions of pounds, it is the really significant measures in the Budget, which involve billions of pounds, that will be remembered in the sweep of history. The most significant of those is the progress towards raising the income tax threshold towards &#163;10,000. My party, the Liberal Democrats, can take particular pleasure in the fact that the Budget and the Finance Act, as the Bill is soon to become, set us off towards another milestone on the route to achieving the &#163;10,000 tax-free threshold. It will already lift 800,000 people out of income tax, and it will do so for 1.1 million people over the coming year and 2 million next year, allowing more people to retain the benefits of their work. We also saw in the Budget the introduction of effective wealth taxes, new rates of stamp duty, a new clampdown on stamp duty avoidance, something the previous Government shirked on many occasions, and new restrictions on reliefs against tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.878.2/7">When the history of this Government and this Budget is written, it is the rise in the threshold to &#163;10,000 that will be long remembered when all the ephemera we have been dealing with, and which Opposition Members have been so keen to raise over the past 12 weeks, are long forgotten. The raising of the threshold, which will lift people out of taxation, is the big issue that will be remembered for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid="c.880.0/1">I know that on Third Reading we cannot debate the issues again, but I want to ask a quick question on a commitment the Government gave last year during a debate in which recognition of marriage in the tax system was discussed. They gave a commitment to bring in the necessary changes to introduce transferable allowances, the need for which is urgent. I would like to remind the Government of their commitment to recognise marriage in the tax system and press the Minister to respond on the matter. The Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/2">&#8220;I have always supported the idea of supporting marriage through the tax system, specifically supporting the idea of a transferable tax allowance. The idea of a transferable tax allowance is in the coalition agreement.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/3">I am sure that the Minister will be able to reaffirm that. The Prime Minister continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/4">&#8220;It&#8217;s something we would like to do in this parliament&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/5">As he is the Prime Minister of the coalition, I am sure we can look forward to a commitment on that at some time in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/6">The Government have made a number of U-turns, or J-turns, as some Members called them&#8212;or, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> called them, recalibrations. It does not matter what we call them, so long as they are done for the right reasons, and the Government&#8217;s U-turns so far have been for the right reasons and we welcome them.</p>
	<p pid="c.880.0/7">However, perhaps it is now time to have a commitment from the Government on transferable allowances. If the Minister is unable to tell us exactly when the Government will introduce legislation to recognise marriage in the tax system, will he provide clarity on a different but related point? Recognition of marriage in the tax system will require HMRC to make various operational changes, particularly in the IT systems. Can he reassure us that this preparatory work is already under way so that when the Government bring forward legislation to recognise marriage in the tax system there is no further delay? If he cannot do so tonight, will he make it an urgent priority to make a statement to the House setting out the time that will be required to change the IT systems and announce that he has instructed that work to begin in readiness for the introduction of the transferable allowance legislation?</p>

	<p pid="c.880.1/1">When listening to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40125" name="Stephen Williams">the hon. Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams)</phrase>, I was reminded of the rather depressing speeches and interventions from some of his Tory colleagues in our previous debates on youth unemployment and the bank bonus tax, who showed very clearly that they do not live in the real world. They have no idea of the impact on young people of the chronic levels of unemployment they now face or the depressing reality that this is a repeat of what happened under the Tories in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s.</p>
	<p pid="c.880.1/2">The shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury mentioned Bob Diamond&#8217;s &#163;100 million in bonuses, which, under the real jobs guarantee scheme, would create 25,000 jobs for young people. I wonder whether Government Members consider that a better use of &#163;100 million in bankers&#8217; bonuses, because I certainly do.</p>
	<p pid="c.880.1/3">We have already seen new schemes from the Government which are depressingly familiar; they remind me of the youth opportunities programme and its successor, the youth training scheme, in the early &#8217;80s, and of how benefits were withdrawn from young people during those years when there were no jobs. There are no jobs for young people in my constituency or in many parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.881.6/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, after some careful thought. In answer to his question, in my constituency the biggest difficulty with the future jobs fund was that, first, the placements were not real jobs but national service, because they were from the Government or charities; and, secondly, they had no future. They did not, therefore, meet even the definition of their own title: future jobs fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.881.6/2">The hon. Gentleman has heard about the situation in South Derbyshire. The situation in Gloucestershire is that the number of apprenticeships has risen massively over the past three years and has continued to go up by 20% over the past year, and that youth unemployment has fallen by 150 people every month for the past three months. It is not perfect, but things are getting better.</p>

	<p pid="c.881.7/1">I cannot decide which of those 14 questions to answer, but as a former banker the hon. Gentleman is in a good position to comment on the financial crisis, which was caused by some of his former colleagues. What he says gives no comfort. He mentions national service, and I went back to the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, but he has gone back far further than that, to something that really did not solve any problems for young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.882.1/1">I speak to people in my constituency all the time, and they tell me just how hard it is to find jobs.

	<p pid="c.882.1/2">The reality is that, in this situation, just as in previous decades under previous Conservative Governments, employers are already turning to people who have just left school or college or just graduated; they are not looking at people who have been out of work for a long period. The depressing reality is that we will see another generation of young people consigned to the scrapheap unless this Government take the action that the Labour party proposes in repeating the bankers&#8217; bonus tax.</p>

Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase>, who is no longer here, mentioned several times the fact that the banks are not lending and said that that is the problem, but he forgot to say that the reason the banks are not lending is that they have no confidence in this Government&#8212;the Government who have pushed us back into a double-dip recession so that we are now one of only two countries in Europe in that position, the other being Italy. That lack of confidence is why banks would rather shore up their own position&#8212;and, of course, pay exorbitant bonuses to their top executives.</p>
	<p pid="c.882.7/3">The banks are not lending to the small businesses that need the money to create the jobs and drive the growth that is needed. Unless the banks start to do that, the Government need to step in.</p>
	<p pid="c.882.7/4">That is why the proposal from Labour is so important. It is why repeating the bankers&#8217; bonus tax would make so much difference to young people and to this country as a whole. But what did we get from this Government? The cut in the 50p tax rate. Three hundred thousand of the wealthiest people in the country will benefit from a tax cut paid for by the rest of us, particularly the poorest and pensioners through the granny tax. That is the reality of the Government&#8217;s proposal, which they are pushing through tonight. That is why we should oppose the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.882.7/5">What I expected was an end to the sort of heckling we have heard from Ministers, who clearly enjoy the prospect of young people being out of work. I would like to think that that is not what they really think. I had hoped for a degree of fairness from the Government&#8212;perhaps I was being unreasonably optimistic.

	<p pid="c.883.3/1">If it were true that it helps the poorest people in our society, perhaps the hon. Gentleman would have a point, but it does not help many of the very poorest and it does not help those young people I was talking about who cannot find a job because the Government will not take action and because they cut the future jobs fund when they first came into office.</p>
	<p pid="c.883.3/2">What we really needed from this Government was a Budget of fairness. Instead, we got that tax cut. What they should be doing is repeating Labour&#8217;s bankers&#8217; bonus tax, which raised &#163;3.5 billion&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Government Members do not have to take my word for it; they can take the word of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which they themselves set up. They are even questioning their own organisation&#8217;s figures. That &#163;3.5 billion was nearly twice as much as the &#163;1.8 billion raised by the bank levy. The bank levy is a start, but the Government could repeat the bank bonus tax and use the money to get young people back to work and the housing industry going. The temporary VAT cut would help small businesses that cannot get loans from the banks.</p>
	<p pid="c.883.3/3">I know that people want to get home. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;] Always happy to oblige. We have had a Budget for the wealthiest in our society. The Bill gives help to the top 300,000 earners, but does nothing for young people or those out of work.</p>

	<p pid="c.890.2/1">Our national health service employs more than 1.7 million people. Of those, just under half are clinically qualified, including 120,000 hospital doctors, 40,000 general practitioners, 400,000 nurses and 25,000 ambulance staff, as well as an army of other health care workers. Only the Wal-Mart supermarket chain, Indian Railways and the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army directly employ more people.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/2">On average, our health service deals with 1 million patients every 36 hours. That is about 500 people a minute or eight people a second. As those figures suggest, the size and volume of the NHS means that literally millions of interactions between patients and staff occur every single day. In the vast majority of cases, these interactions are positive and result in successful outcomes for patients and staff alike, which is why, simply put, the NHS is one of the best health care models on the planet. But sadly, things sometimes go wrong for patients and badly wrong for staff. The superb staff who provide such sterling service to the public can find themselves the victims of violence while working on our behalf to provide those very services. The purpose of this debate is to highlight this wrong and seek support from the Government for righting it.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/3">The NHS management service&#8217;s latest statistics reveal more than 150 reported physical assaults on health care staff per day&#8212;and that is before verbal assault is taken into consideration. According to the latest 2010-11 NHS survey, 7% of NHS staff had been victims of assault in the previous 12 months. The Royal College of Nursing&#8217;s research reveals further troubling statistics, with almost 11% of those surveyed having been assaulted at work in the previous two years and more than 60% of all respondents having suffered verbal abuse at work. Indeed, one respondent commented that</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/4">&#8220;verbal abuse seems to just be accepted as part of our work&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/5">That is totally indefensible.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/6">In Northern Lincolnshire and Goole hospital trust, which serves the Scunthorpe area, there were 13.1 assaults per 1,000 members of staff in 2009-10. Although that figure is below the national yearly average of 16.8 per 1,000, it is still far too high. One assault against any person simply trying to do their job in any profession, never mind people who routinely save lives every day, is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/7">Two weeks ago, I joined a local ambulance crew for five hours of their 12-hour shift, and I was hugely impressed by the professionalism of the paramedic team and the staff at Scunthorpe general&#8217;s accident and emergency department. Patients were treated with great skill, care and dignity, which is exactly as it should be, but I was shocked to learn that the fantastic paramedic I was with had gone to a house call about a year ago and was seriously assaulted by the man he had gone to help. He was chased around the house by the man, who violently and persistently assaulted him. The assault was so bad that it resulted in his being off work for six months.</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/8">I received today this e-mail from a staff nurse at Scunthorpe general hospital:</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/9">&#8220;I understand that you are taking part in an adjournment debate tonight on the above subject. I was assaulted by a patient in January this year. With colleagues I went to clean up a patient that&#8230;had attacked a nurse earlier in the day and no one felt able to approach him since. I was subjected to a violent attack which meant I was on sick leave for three months. I have had intensive physiotherapy and still attend physio regularly. I suffered a needlestick injury while trying to sedate the patient and will be tested for blood borne viruses in the next few weeks. During the time I was off work and, for some time since, I have been in constant pain, I had limited use of my right arm and restricted movement of my neck. I could not hold a pen to write or brush my teeth. Everyday tasks took hours and I became depressed and withdrawn. Even now I am unable to perform all my duties as a nurse. Yet, mine was not a serious injury. I have made considerable improvement but will always have some level of pain and restriction of movement.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.890.2/10">She goes on to thank us for raising this issue in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.891.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing this issue to the Chamber, and I wish to associate myself with his comments. In Northern Ireland, including in my constituency and in particular the Ulster hospital, there have been several attacks on accident and emergency personnel and ambulances. It is not specific to Scunthorpe but happens across the UK. Would better co-ordination between the hospital authorities, ambulance and emergency personnel and the police be a way of addressing some of these issues?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-07-03c.891.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" speakername="Nicholas Dakin" colnum="891"  time="023:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/debtext/120703-0004.htm#1207045001244">
	<p pid="c.891.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. He reminds us that, sadly, the problem affects people across the nations of the United Kingdom. I will come to the issue he raises later, but I want now to quote the final comments of the nurse who wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/2">&#8220;You can have no idea what it means to have this problem recognised and debated. I do not expect to be compensated in monetary terms for the pain I have suffered or the possibility that I may not be able to work to retirement age but I do want to see measures put in place to effectively protect staff who are expected to deal with difficult and violent patients.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/3">The costs of such assaults are multi-fold. There is the cost to the NHS of care for the victim, the cost to the NHS of the health worker&#8217;s absence from work and the possible loss of an employee if recovery is not complete. Added to that is the potentially devastating impact on the health worker&#8217;s own health and well-being, with further strain on family, friends and the wider community. I would like to pay tribute to all the fantastic people working in the NHS, including the people and organisations working hard to prevent such violence from taking place against health workers. Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Trust has launched an e-petition to heighten public awareness of the issue. The fact that the trust has recognised it in this way is to be applauded, but there is much more to be done. That is why the trust&#8217;s partnership approach, working with Unison and others to find ways of practically addressing the issue, is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/4">NHS Employers&#8212;part of the partnership for occupational safety and health in health care&#8212;is also actively involved in raising the issue of violence and aggression against staff, and is looking at how it can be managed, working hard to help create healthy and productive workplaces.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/5">Work is also under way&#8212;led by NHS Protect, with input from the Royal College of Nursing and others&#8212;to look at preventing and managing physical assaults on staff which result from a patient&#8217;s underlying medical condition, such as dementia. Many physical assaults result from a patient&#8217;s underlying clinical condition, but rather than ignoring this, steps can be taken to reduce the risks. Work to take these positive initiatives forward needs to be systematically supported and funded if it is to bring real change and reduce the risk to health workers from such patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/6">All these initiatives are positive and to be welcomed. However, I want to highlight a number of concerns raised with me by the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and others. I am keen for the Minister&#8212;who I know is committed to ensuring that the Government do their best in this area&#8212;to say in his response what practical steps the Government are taking to address those concerns. The Government have funded work by the Design Council with a limited number of A and E units to reduce violence through design solutions. That is to be welcomed. How will the work be evaluated, and how will any improvements to the safety of staff and patients in such units be shared and implemented more widely? With the end of Secretary of State directions, which required NHS trusts to have measures in place to protect staff, how will it be possible to ensure that all provider services meet standards similar to those currently set under Secretary of State directions? They include access to a local security management specialist, training on conflict resolution, central reporting of physical assaults and a requirement to follow policies and guidance&#8212;for example, lone working guidance&#8212;published by NHS Protect.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/7">Lone working nurses and health care workers absolutely need protection. They often form an invisible work force. Many health workers already work alone with limited, if any, back-up or support. The quite proper policy direction of providing more services in the community means that more health workers are likely to find themselves in potentially vulnerable situations as sole workers. How will Government ensure that there are systems in place to minimise risk and protect the work force?</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/8">Full consideration needs to be given to the possible impact of changes in health care delivery combined with efficiency savings on the likelihood of risk of violence against staff. In particular, a risk assessment of the impact of closing units, lengthening A and E waiting times and staff shortages needs to be undertaken and the effects mitigated. That needs to be recognised. In this climate of cost-cutting and austerity, how can we be certain that such measures will be put in place to reduce the risks to staff? Staff who report incidents need more support from their employers and the police. They need feedback after they have reported incidents, and they need to know what action is being taken to prevent any reoccurrence. Lack of feedback and support can lead to under-reporting of incidents and reduced morale.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/9">I welcome the fact that pressure from Unison has resulted in a change to the code for Crown prosecutors to increase the number of prosecutions for assaults on public servants. The closer working relationship between NHS local security management specialists and trade union safety representatives has been a positive development. NHS Protect has also agreed protocols with the police and</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/10">the Crown Prosecution Service. Under the memorandum of understanding with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the police are committed to progressing all cases of violence and abuse against NHS staff as a priority. The Crown Prosecution Service has also made a commitment to</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/11">&#8220;work with the police to ensure that these cases are treated with the seriousness that they deserve and encourage a robust charging policy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/12">It is crucial that that should lead to a more consistent approach by police forces to following up the perpetrators of either physical or verbal abuse. RCN research suggests that police follow-ups are sometimes inconsistent around the country. Some forces follow up complaints robustly and work closely with local hospitals, but others appear reluctant to get involved in procedures, especially when the incident involves a patient with an underlying mental health condition. Such incidents in particular need more close examination, as a significant number of physical assaults on health workers are by patients with underlying mental health problems. How can the Government ensure that the memorandum of understanding between ACPO, the CPS and NHS Protect will be consistently and effectively implemented?</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/13">The reporting and investigation of assaults also needs to be properly addressed. According to the RCN survey, although only about 11% had suffered physical abuse at work, 74% of the incidents they recalled were never reported to the police. Staff need to be confident that they will be supported by their employers and the police. They need to be given the confidence always to report assaults. There needs to be a culture of trust that, when reported, such assaults will be taken seriously and fully investigated, with proper support given to the victims. Proper feedback and support in the reporting process will help to keep up morale in the NHS work force and reassure staff that they should not expect to be put in danger while carrying out their duties on behalf of all of us.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/14">In this age of austerity, budgets are being squeezed, and organisations that protect workers are being asked to do important jobs with a lot less funding. For example, the Health and Safety Executive, which plays an important role in keeping people safe at work, has had its work force reduced by a third in the last 10 years, with the number of inspections that it carries out falling from 75,000 to 23,000 a year. That could lead to the real danger of worker safety being jeopardised, which makes it even more important for NHS employers to take completely seriously the need to protect their work force and minimise the risk of attack from patients. Health and safety is not red tape; health and safety saves lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/15">Worryingly, the cuts in NHS and local authority budgets and in the Health and Safety Executive are in danger of combining with the confusion caused by the NHS reforms to cause local security management specialists to become increasingly reliant on safety representatives to help them to identify those work areas in which NHS staff will be most at risk. Many local security management specialists used to work with primary care trusts. With the abolition of PCTs, there is a possible danger of confusion and uncertainty about their role in the workplaces that they cover. How will the Government ensure that the risk inherent in the changes does not lead to more health care workers finding themselves in situations in which their personal safety is put at risk?</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/16">Every single person should be able to go to work without the fear of physical harm. I strongly back Unison&#8217;s calls for a zero-tolerance approach to safeguarding NHS staff. Everyone needs to work together with a clear and persistent focus to make sure that all staff can carry out their work free from the fear and the threat of physical or verbal assault. When individuals are found guilty of attacks on health care workers, that should inform the sentencing and be treated with the utmost seriousness.</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/17">As Julian Corlett, Unison branch secretary for Scunthorpe general hospital, wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/18">&#8220;Violence directed at health workers is never acceptable and is not part of the contract of employment. We must dispel the myth that violence in the NHS is inevitable, or unpredictable and therefore uncontrollable. It therefore remains our key objective to see a significant and sustained reduction in the number of violent incidents directed at NHS staffs across the country, with more prosecutions and severe sanctions for those perpetrating such violence. There has to be the presumption that those committing these offences are more likely to face prosecution than not if we are to see sustained reductions in the figures anytime soon.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/19">Julian speaks from experience with great passion and clarity; his words will echo round this Chamber and in the world outside it. We should be vigilant and proactive in ensuring the safety of those who work within the NHS. In the words of the children&#8217;s laureate, Michael Rosen, on the 60th anniversary of the NHS, we must do all we can to protect the</p>
	<p pid="c.891.1/20">&#8220;hands that touch us first...and the hands that touch us last&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.894.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> on securing this debate on violence against health care staff. It is an issue that every Member of this House can agree is totally and utterly unacceptable in every instance. I would like to praise the reasoned and measured way in which the hon. Gentleman made his points. I also share with him the disgust about what has happened to some of his constituents who work&#8212;day in, day out&#8212;on behalf of patients in his constituency. Sadly, this problem is not restricted solely to his constituency, as it applies to all constituencies where, regrettably, acts of violence are directed against NHS staff. I can assure him that this Government have zero tolerance of that sort of treatment &#8212;physical or verbal&#8212;against people who work in our NHS on behalf of patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/2">Violence against health care workers can never be tolerated. Nobody should expect to suffer violence at work. This is especially the case for those who are committed to caring for others. Clearly, the human cost alone makes it unacceptable; although the physical effects may be transient, the deeper emotional scars can often last a lifetime. Beyond the effect on the individual, too, there are other factors: the disruption to services caused by the incident and its aftermath; the impact on staff welfare, sickness absence, recruitment and retention and the cost of additional security, all of which divert resources, human and financial, away from providing health care.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/3">In short, the cost to the NHS of violence is huge and it affects us all. I am determined that we should do all we can to prevent violence against health care staff and to take the toughest possible action when violence does occur to ensure that those responsible are held accountable</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/4">for their actions. From the outset, the Government have been committed to taking action to tackle the problem of violence. We have encouraged NHS organisations to work more closely with their local police forces to clamp down on anyone who is aggressive or abusive to staff&#8212;and while we may have made progress, there is still a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/5">In 2010-11, the latest year for which figures are available, there were almost 58,000 reported physical assaults on members of NHS staff. Hon. Members are able to consult the reported figures for each health body, as these are placed in the Library each year. In the majority of those assaults&#8212;some 40,000&#8212;the patient&#8217;s medical condition was a factor. This means the culpability of the assailant may have been in question or that a legal sanction may not have been appropriate. However, that still leaves some 18,000 cases in which the assailant&#8217;s medical condition was not a factor. While this number is smaller than for the previous year, it is nowhere near small enough: 18,000 is 18,000 too many. We are committed to taking whatever further action is required. The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about sanctions and convictions. I can tell him that sanctions against offenders, ranging from cautions to fines to imprisonment, have increased&#8212;there was a 24% increase in 2010-11&#8212;but the number is still not high enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/6">We are taking action in a number of ways. Some are new, while others have succeeded in the past and we have therefore continued to support them. Of course, the main priority is to prevent violence by protecting staff and managing high-risk situations before they escalate. NHS Protect, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, is the body that leads the work to tackle crime throughout the health service. It has identified violence against staff as one of its key priorities for 2012-13, and has developed a work programme aimed primarily at preventing assaults.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/7">There are trained security management specialists at more than 90% of NHS trusts in England. They are responsible for investigating security breaches, along with the police, and for implementing new systems to protect NHS staff more effectively. NHS Protect supports NHS organisations by providing advice, assistance and best-practice guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/8">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introduced powers to deal with antisocial behaviour on NHS hospital premises, which enable an authorised person to remove those who are suspected of creating a nuisance or disturbance. A three-year training programme funded by the Department of Health and managed by NHS Protect, which will end in April 2012, has enabled more than more than 600 staff at over 80 hospitals to be trained in the implementation of the Act. They have been empowered to respond to disruption such as foul language and verbal abuse, intimidating gestures, excessive noise in waiting areas or wards, and the obstruction of thoroughfares. Feedback from staff trained by NHS Protect in the use of the Act&#8217;s provisions indicates that the powers are working well in practice on the front line, helping to provide a safer environment for NHS patients, staff and visitors.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised the important issue of design, particularly but not solely in accident and emergency departments. In November last year, I was pleased to be</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/10">able to speak at the launch of a project organised jointly by the Department of Health and the Design Council involving the use of design to reduce violence in A and E departments. Leading experts developed and tested potential solutions and identified areas for action. We are currently in the implementation phase of that project. Early indications are positive, but in order for the impact of the solutions to be fully evaluated, a detailed framework has been generated by the design team to record both quantitative and qualitative data. Those data will generate the evidence base that will formally endorse the concepts, proving their efficiency and their impact on the costs of violence and aggression in A and E departments. The evaluation has not yet finished, but we hope to communicate the results later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/11">The Government intend to change the legal framework in respect of antisocial behaviour. One of those changes is designed specifically to tackle antisocial behaviour affecting the NHS. As Members may have noted from the Home Office White Paper that was issued in May this year, we propose that NHS Protect be named as a relevant authority to apply for crime prevention injunctions. That is intended to enable a quicker response to the problem of antisocial behaviour, and to avoid the need for the police or local authorities to apply for injunctions on behalf of an NHS body.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/12">While much of the work will focus on assaults for which the person committing the act can be held responsible, we will not ignore cases in which a person&#8217;s medical condition is a factor in violence, especially as such cases represent the majority of reported physical assaults against NHS staff. NHS Protect is working with a clinically led expert group to develop guidance on the prevention and management of violence in circumstances in which the medical condition of a patient puts staff at greater risk of assault.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/13">When necessary, we need to challenge the idea that the existence of a particular medical condition is a bar to prosecution. Whenever an assault occurs, an assessment of the assailant's culpability must be made. When assailants cannot be considered legally culpable for their actions, prosecutions cannot be appropriate, but when assessments reveal that people were in control of their actions and knew what they were doing, there should be a presumption that sanctions will be sought. Indeed, there is some clinical opinion that such action can assist in making a person understand the impact of their behaviour, and so affect it in a way that discourages repeated incidents. For action to be taken against offenders, we first need staff to report when they have been subject to violence, either verbal or physical. That staff have confidence in the action that will be taken is paramount in encouraging them to do so, and the role of the local security management specialists is key to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/14">All the initiatives I have mentioned are designed to prevent violence from occurring. We must, however, remain prepared for the times this prevention activity is not as effective as we would like it to be. When violence does occur, we need to ensure that those responsible are held to account.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/15">To pick up on the valid point the hon. Gentleman made about joint collaboration, NHS Protect has signed a three-way agreement with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service, with the stated intention of curbing violence and antisocial</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/16">behaviour in the NHS. This agreement recognises that the police and the CPS are bound by guidance and codes of practice on communications with victims and witnesses, and that employers have a duty to support in every way they can staff who have been victims. This joint-working agreement supports the Government&#8217;s commitment to act. NHS Protect will this year be working to translate this national agreement into local protocols for more effective collaboration between the police, the CPS and health bodies in seeking appropriate sanctions for acts of violence. NHS Protect is currently identifying best practice in the management of physical assaults in mental health settings, with a view to issuing specific guidance for that sector. This will include working with the police to take forward prosecutions where it is appropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/17">The hon. Gentleman also raised the important issue of how to protect the lone worker. To better protect lone workers, NHS Protect led the delivery of a lone worker alarm service for the NHS. Over 40,000 staff, and more than half of NHS trusts across England, now use this service, which enables a lone worker to signal covertly for help from the emergency services if they find themselves in a dangerous situation. The service also provides a</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/18">system control centre, which enables listening to, and recording of, incidents in case evidence is later needed as part of a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/19">I wholeheartedly share the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concern about violence against health care staff. We should always do everything we can to prevent it, and when we cannot prevent it, we should seek the strongest sanctions against those responsible.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/20">I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the House are reassured by my account of the work we are undertaking, and by the Government&#8217;s, and my own personal, commitment to tackling this completely unacceptable problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/21">I thank the hon. Gentleman. He rightly holds this subject very close to his heart. The Government share his concern, and we are determined to do all we can to minimise the cowardly, dastardly and disgusting attacks on people who do so much to help the frail, the vulnerable and the sick in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.894.0/22" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
