	<p pid="c.141.5/1">Quantitative easing is a tool of the independent Monetary Policy Committee and has been designed to work through channels other than the impaired banking system by stimulating activity in capital markets. The Government and the Bank of England are working together on a new funding for lending scheme that will more broadly support sustained and increased bank lending to the economy. I can confirm for the first time that in the three months since the start of the national loan guarantee scheme, over 10,000 cheaper loans worth over &#163;1.5 billion have been offered to businesses. I can also confirm that we have today secured EU state aid approval to extend the scheme to medium-sized businesses with a turnover of up to &#163;250 million. That means 99.9% of UK businesses can now benefit.</p>

	<p pid="c.141.6/1">Quantitative easing was certainly intended to stimulate the economy, but in reality it is being used to write off the debts of reckless banks with hundreds of billions of pounds&#8217; worth of virtual money. Has anyone in Government thought through the consequences of this policy, and if so, what are they?</p>

	<p pid="c.141.7/1">The Bank of England conducted a study of the first round of QE that it undertook under the last Government, and estimated that it had increased real GDP by between 1.5% and 2%. The Bank&#8217;s chief economist says that the asset programme regime</p>

	<p pid="c.142.0/1">Now that the Bank of England has finally shown more willingness to provide some liquidity support, there should be no obstacle to the exercising of more flexibility by the Financial Services Authority when it comes to how the liquidity buffers are used. That is being desperately demanded by banks. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the FSA should take action as soon as possible, and that such action is what is required to provide borrowing and lending at reasonable rates for the hundreds and thousands of businesses throughout the country that need it so desperately?</p>

	<p pid="c.142.1/1">The liquidity auction undertaken by the Bank of England last week was very welcome, and the Bank is proposing future auctions. My hon. Friend, who chairs the Treasury Committee, has been prescient in pointing to some of the procyclical nature&#8212;if unintended&#8212;of some of the liquidity regulation in the United Kingdom in recent years. The Financial Policy Committee was set up to look at risks on both the downside and the upside. The Financial Services Authority must make its own independent decisions, but I am sure that it will have paid close attention to my speech and to the speech of the Governor of the Bank of England at the Mansion House.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.2/1">Notwithstanding the Chancellor&#8217;s warm words about the impact of quantitative easing, I have yet to meet a banker, a businessman or indeed a Government representative who can identify the benefits that have accrued as a result of its introduction. While I do not necessarily oppose it, all the evidence that I am being given by bankers suggests that lack of demand is causing the main problem. Will the Chancellor do something to stimulate consumer demand and investment confidence in order to maximise the potential that quantitative easing might bring?</p>

	<p pid="c.142.3/1">In conducting its most recent assessment of the UK economy, the IMF explicitly looked at unconventional monetary policy tools that are currently being used, and concluded that quantitative easing was having a positive impact. I think that we should welcome that. I believe that we are able to pursue loose monetary policy&#8212;that we are able to use all the tools that are available to us on the monetary policy side&#8212;precisely because we have international credibility on the fiscal side.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.4/1" qnum="113599">I, too, warmly welcome the action of the Bank of England last week to increase liquidity in its liquidity auction, but should not the role of the Financial Policy Committee be not only to stand against procyclical financial policy and liquidity buffers, but to lean against the wind and make sure that we can get the lending to businesses in our constituencies?</p>

	<p pid="c.142.5/1">The Government established the Financial Policy Committee because under the previous tripartite regime, designed and implemented by the shadow Chancellor, absolutely no one was paying attention to overall levels of debt and credit in the economy. That is why we had such a deep recession, and why we went from such a large boom to such a big bust&#8212;to coin a</p>
	<p pid="c.142.5/2">phrase. My hon. Friend is entirely right: the FPC should be symmetrical in the way in which it looks at risks. We have made that clear, and we are amending the Financial Services Bill in the House of Lords to ensure that that the FPC has, as a secondary objective, due regard for the Government&#8217;s broader economic policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.143.0/1">Yesterday the <i>Financial Times </i>reported that the Bank for International Settlements was warning of the dangers for economies that get hooked on ultra-low interest rates. Is not the reality that monetary policy alone will not kick-start the sustained recovery, and that fiscal intervention will be needed if we are to avoid a lost decade?</p>

	<p pid="c.143.1/1">The very low interest and mortgage rates in Britain are extremely welcome to families and businesses across the country. If we want to know what the alternative looks like, we just have to look across the channel at countries that have not been able to maintain their credibility in international markets, where we see rising bank lending and funding costs and increased costs for Government borrowing. We have now five countries in the eurozone who have had to apply for bail-outs. It is because we have fiscal credibility despite inheriting the largest budget deficit in the European Union that we have been able to keep our interest rates very low.</p>

Figures out this morning show that, with the economy in recession, tax receipts are falling, and the benefits bill is going up, so borrowing is already &#163;4 billion higher this year than last.

	<p pid="c.144.7/1">I wholeheartedly agree with my right hon. Friend. It is a very important point that, in times of economic stress worldwide, some countries may seek a protectionist approach. That is why at the forthcoming European summit the Prime Minister will again be arguing for measures within Europe to strengthen the single market and to increase free trade within the EU, and for measures for the EU to take to build on the free trade agreements that, collectively, we are signing with a number of other important economies in the world.

This means that fuel duty will be 10p a litre lower than planned by the last Labour Government. We are on the side of working families and businesses, and this will fuel our recovery at this very difficult economic time for the world.

HMRC is deploying staff more flexibly and conducting small-scale pilots to see whether the private sector can provide additional capacity. HMRC is determined to improve performance.</p>

She makes the point very powerfully indeed that Scotland is &#8220;better together&#8221; as part of the United Kingdom. We have greater strength together as part of a more credible economic unit and part of the shared monetary policy of the Bank of England.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.161.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40528" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" speakeroffice="The Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="161"  time="015:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0001.htm#12062679000439">
	<p pid="c.161.1/1">Last week, 196 nations met in Rio, 20 years after the original Earth summit. Our task was to find a way to set the world back on a sustainable path. Important progress had been made in the past two decades on reducing poverty and protecting our environment, but all in all, ambitions had not been met. Our dilemma was to agree ways to grow our economies without hoovering up or destroying our precious natural resources, recognising that our economic and environmental agendas must go hand in hand. Our challenge was to take the right decisions, not just for ourselves, but for the next generation which, in just 18 years, will need 30% more water, 45% more energy, and 50% more food.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/2">Was this summit an unqualified success on all those fronts? No, it was not&#8212;but few would have expected it to be. But we did make progress on the key areas that the UK sees as the priority for sustainable development and green growth. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for her commendable efforts at the summit itself and for her intensive preparations with the Secretary of State for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/3">At the summit, the United Kingdom Government played a crucial role in leading on four important shifts. First, while the Rio declaration was not all that we would have wanted, this is the first time that a multilateral document expressing such strong support for the green economy has been agreed. That in itself is a major achievement recognising that, in the long term, greening our economies should not conflict with growing them. The declaration helped to alleviate some of the fears of developing countries that green growth is a veil for a kind of eco-protectionism designed to stymie their development. It united nations behind the simple principle that, as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it at the summit,</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/4">&#8220;the only viable development is sustainable development which will deliver lasting progress for everyone.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/5">Secondly, Rio+20 recognised that we need to develop broader measures of progress to complement GDP in order to take account of the natural assets that will contribute to future prosperity&#8212;so-called GDP-plus. In the UK we have already committed to including natural capital within our system of national accounts by 2020. We worked hard at the summit to ensure that all nations present recognised the importance of broader measures of environmental and social wealth to complement GDP.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/6">Thirdly, we agreed to set up the sustainable development goals&#8212;a concept proposed by Colombia. I was one of the first to welcome this idea when President Santos visited London in November. The UK has been pushing hard to secure agreement ever since, and achieving it, even at this high outline level, was no mean feat. The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, said that the SDGs should draw on the success of the millennium development goals and should be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework. We would have liked to see specific themes agreed, focusing on ensuring that everyone can access enough food, energy and water, but getting such agreement was always going to be a huge</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/7">undertaking. The UK Government will continue to keep up the pressure for rapid agreement. From now on, the process must be coherent and co-ordinated with the work of Secretary-General Ban&#8217;s high-level panel on the post-2015 framework, which the Prime Minister will co-chair along with the leaders of Liberia and Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/8">Fourthly and finally, at Rio national Governments recognised the importance of working alongside businesses. Thanks in no small part to the leadership of UK firms, Rio recognised the role of corporate sustainability reporting to their shareholders and to prospective investors&#8212;something that would have been inconceivable even a year ago. I also announced in Rio that we will be the first country anywhere to mandate large companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions. A growing number of companies and investors are realising that their own success is directly linked to sustainable, green growth. We hope that the call from all nations for businesses to report their sustainability performance will usher in a new era of transparency and consistency in the global business community.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/9">In summary, although Rio+20 did not go as far as we would have liked, it revived a global commitment to an agenda that has come gravely under threat. Progress was made in the areas where progress needed to be made. The declaration agreed by all 196<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120703/corrtext/120703c0001.htm#column_7-8MC"><i>[Official Report, 3 July 2012, Vol. 547, c. 7-8MC.]</i></a> countries should not be seen as the upper end of our ambition; it should be our baseline and we should all strive to surpass its expectation. We must build on the steps that were taken to reinvigorate the drive for sustainable development and lasting growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.1/10">The UK played a leading part last week because we are on track to deliver our commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on official development assistance to developing countries from 2013; because I announced the adaptation for smallholder agriculture programme, which will improve the lives of more than 6 million smallholder farms; because we are taking the lead in areas such as reproductive health and family planning; because we are the first country whose major businesses will report their greenhouse gas emissions as part of their annual accounts; and because of the range of ways in which we are greening our economy. We will remain committed to working with our partners and will be ambitious for the future. The summit is over but the work continues, and the UK will continue to lead from the front.</p>

	<p pid="c.162.0/1">I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the advance copy of his statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/2">The original Rio declaration sought to eradicate poverty, reduce unsustainable production and consumption, and promote greater co-operation to protect the world&#8217;s ecosystems. It is as relevant today as it was 20 years ago. Expectations were low for this summit, and those expectations were met. I pay tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who worked as part of the EU delegation to prevent the summit from reaching abject failure.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/3">There was a glimmer of hope. Ban Ki-moon&#8217;s zero hunger challenge aims for a future in which everyone enjoys their basic human right to food and in which global food systems are resilient. It aims to provide</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/4">access to adequate food all year round, increase small farm productivity and see zero waste of food. We welcome the UK&#8217;s contribution of &#163;150 million to help meet the zero hunger challenge.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/5">Will curbing land grabs by large companies and improving land rights, especially for women, be on the agenda of the high-level meeting on hunger that will take place during the Olympics? What does the Deputy Prime Minister make of the Prime Minister&#8217;s comments yesterday that a future Conservative Government would consider handing out some state benefits &#8220;in kind&#8221; rather than in cash? Does he think that handing out food vouchers to the poor is a good idea, when the Brazilian zero hunger scheme was based on the Bolsa Fam&#237;lia, which gave money directly to families in poverty and let them choose how best to feed their children? How will the zero hunger initiative tackle food poverty in the UK, where the Trussell Trust charity estimates that it will feed 130,000 people this year, 45,000 of whom are children?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/6">The Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that the Prime Minister, alongside the Presidents of Liberia and Indonesia, will co-chair a new UN committee to establish a new set of millennium development goals to follow those that expire in 2015. How will the new goals relate to the sustainable development goals that will emerge from Rio?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/7">There was progress in the field of energy, with the Secretary-General&#8217;s sustainable energy for all initiative, which received pledges of $323 billion in funding to bring clean energy to more than a billion people in developing countries. We welcome that. We also welcome the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement at Rio that the UK will introduce carbon reporting for 1,800 quoted companies from April next year, as set out in Labour&#8217;s landmark Climate Change Act 2008. That was, sadly, the weakest option that the Government consulted on. It creates the anomaly that British Airways will report its carbon footprint as a public company, but that Virgin Atlantic, as a private company, will not. However, we are the first country in the world to do it, which gives us a temporary, green competitive advantage to make up for the Government&#8217;s disastrous handling of the solar feed-in tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/8">The agreements on biodiversity, oceans and the trade in endangered species are welcome. However, the Government have refused to guarantee funding for the UK&#8217;s wildlife crime unit after next April. Does he agree that that unit is on the front line of fighting the illegal trade in endangered species, and will he argue for its benefits at the heart of Government?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/9">Sharing the benefits of the planet&#8217;s biodiversity equally is an important building block for what happens after Rio, yet the Government have still not ratified the Nagoya protocol, which was agreed last year, on access to and benefits from genetic resources. What assessment has he made of the action we need to take to comply with the protocol, and will the Government show leadership in the EU by ratifying it?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/10">We know that sustainable development starts at home. Far too often, the Government have been found wanting&#8212;they abolished the Sustainable Development Commission and failed to introduce marine protected areas, and their implementation of their forests policy was disastrous.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/11">Will the Deputy Prime Minister therefore tell the House how the Government will change how they do business to reflect the Rio conference outcomes?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/12">Will the Government publish a UK action plan as a framework for the changes that they seek after Rio? Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree with his right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, for International Development and for the Foreign Office that the Government need to invest more in a resource efficient economy and low-carbon jobs to reduce costs and protect the UK from rising oil prices and energy dependency?</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/13">The Deputy Prime Minister should be in no doubt that the Opposition will work with him across party boundaries to achieve the long-term solutions that our planet needs. Rio showed that the solutions to ending hunger and deforestation, and to securing clean energy and water for the poorest, are all out there. We just need to scale them up.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/14">The scientists tell us we must act now and businesses stand ready to play their part. The tragedy is that the politicians did not agree concrete mechanisms by which those things can happen, but as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, Rio was not a destination but a milestone on a long road. We stand ready to support the Government to make the change we need to deliver the future we want.</p>

	<p pid="c.164.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her recognition of what I think is our shared commitment to the agenda discussed at Rio. I totally share her support for the zero hunger initiative; I attended a session in Rio at which the initiative was discussed. She asked about the hunger summit that will be held this summer. I do not know the precise agenda, but she referred to the importance and legal rights to property and land, which are crucial to dealing with hunger sustainably.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/2">The hon. Lady asked about the interaction between sustainable development goals, ill-defined though they were at the Rio summit, and the work on the post-2015 agenda. The Government&#8217;s strong view is that the sustainable development goals as defined by the group of 30 representatives, which will be established in September, must feed into the wider review of the millennium development goals through the high-level panel that has been established by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/3">I will not disguise from the hon. Lady the fact that within that procedural complexity, there are a lot of sensitivities. Candidly, some developing countries have hitherto felt that their voice is not strongly enough heard in some UN processes. The Prime Minister and his co-chairs will work hard to ensure that the voices of the developing world are properly listened to in the review of the MDGs to allay the concern that precisely the part of the world that will benefit most from the process is shut out from it. We need to do quite of lot of work to ensure that the different acronyms and processes do not start becoming rival acronyms and process&#8212;that is a danger.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/4">The hon. Lady mentioned the sustainable energy for all initiative, which I am glad she supports; it is an outstanding initiative. I hosted a preparatory meeting of the group on the initiative in London some months ago. We had hoped that the Rio declaration would</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/5">adopt the initiative as a core conclusion. In the event, because of the nervousness of some participants on what the initiative means and its implications, it was &#8220;recognised&#8221; in the declaration. We would have inserted a stronger verb, but none the less, as with all those initiatives, we now need to exploit that recognition and work on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/6">The hon. Lady complained that the proposal on greenhouse gas emissions reporting does not go far enough. We have to start somewhere. We are the only country doing this. Some people complain that we have already gone too far and are imposing too many burdens on business. Other business groups, such as the CBI, have welcomed the proposal. I think we are breaking new ground, and I hope she will welcome that rather than cast aspersions on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.164.0/7">The hon. Lady will know that the Darwin initiative is a robust initiative that we are using to monitor the plight of endangered species. Finally, she rightly said that these summits make sense only if one acts consistently with them at home. We are rightly proud of our record: we are the first country to establish a green investment bank; the green deal, which will be up and running in the coming six to eight months or so, will be the largest initiative of its kind for installing energy efficiency measures and bringing down energy bills in homes up and down the country; and the green sector, the green economy, is growing by about 5% a year, employs close to 1 million people in this country and actually runs a trade surplus. That is something we should cherish and celebrate. The carbon floor price is another major innovation of the Government, while the electricity market reform, which is one of the most ambitious legislative and regulatory overhauls of an electricity market I am aware of anywhere in the developed world, is explicitly designed to ensure that we have a sustainable energy mix for future generations.</p>

	<p pid="c.165.0/1">I congratulate everyone involved on what was a genuine team effort. Will the Deputy Prime Minister assure the House that one of Rio&#8217;s lasting legacies will be the agreement to reaffirm a universal, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system for food and agricultural products? Will he give an undertaking that we will really push for Doha to deliver this through the World Trade Organisation?</p>

	<p pid="c.165.1/1">No one is in any doubt that one of the greatest boosts to prosperity across the world would be a successful completion of the very, very, very, very long-awaited Doha development round. It is immensely frustrating that getting agreement on it has proved so elusive. Many have written it off altogether, and it is difficult not to be pessimistic about it, but that does not mean that we should not continue to pursue the cause of multilateral trade liberalisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.165.2/1">Given the frustratingly disappointing outcome of Rio and the crisis of investor confidence in solar PV, onshore wind and nuclear in Britain, is it not even more important that the Deputy Prime Minister joins the growing cross-party support for the Severn barrage, which would generate 5% of the</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/2">electricity in Britain and create nearly 40,000 jobs&#8212;a green project that will deliver the Government&#8217;s renewable energy commitments?</p>

	<p pid="c.166.0/1">I pay tribute to the fervour with which the right hon. Gentleman is throwing himself into this new cause in a political career of many great causes. I agree with the underlying assertion that for investors to make investments in major energy infrastructure of whatever kind, they need long-term stability and long-term certainty about the direction of Government policy. That is precisely what the electricity market reform aims to provide.</p>

	<p pid="c.166.1/1">Despite the prominence given before the conference to protecting the world&#8217;s oceans in the face of the ongoing collapse in world fish stocks and the continued obliteration of coastal livelihoods, it has been widely reported that the concrete steps put forward were effectively blocked by Russia, Canada and the US. Is that true? If not, what specific steps were agreed?</p>

	<p pid="c.166.2/1">In many ways, it is actually more dispiriting than the hon. Gentleman suggests, because we did not manage to get any agreement on any of the themes governing the sustainable development goals. Sensibly, perhaps, in view of the dynamics at Rio, that has been left for the working group in September. On the plus side, from his point of view, the text reflects the importance of oceans and their sustainable use, and I would be surprised if oceans did not feature prominently in the final shape of the sustainable development goals as they are crafted in the months and years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.166.4/1">We certainly want to see full ratification of the Nagoya protocol. It is something that this country has done, and I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is working with her counterparts in the European Union to encourage those who have not yet taken the necessary steps to do so. To make one observation, the Nagoya protocol flowed from the original Rio+20 summit, but it was not agreed at that summit. The only reason why I make that point is that, for those who say that an insufficient number of legal texts were agreed this time around, it is worth recalling that the history of the last Rio+20 summit was that, while it was much more substantive than this one, it did lead and create a momentum that subsequently led to legal texts. I say to those who have responded with complete despair about this summit that it is now a matter of what we do with it and whether we can turn it into legally binding documents, which is the challenge for the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.167.0/1">My understanding is that Mexico has done just that, just now, so it is not right to say that countries are not seeking to follow our lead. In my bilateral discussions with members of the Brazilian Government, I was struck by how forceful they were, as a major emerging economic power, in expressing the view that their own future success would be defined by their ability to grow sustainably, which would require a departure from simply copying how development has been pursued in the past. I am afraid that I do not share the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s pessimism about the virtues of, and potential for, sustainable growth in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.167.1/1">The final text from the Rio summit effectively sells out the vision of a green economy by replacing the usual phrase &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; or even &#8220;sustainable growth&#8221; with a phrase of a quite different meaning&#8212;&#8220;sustained economic growth&#8221;.

She has been a little partial in her selection of those two words. The whole assumption behind Rio was an overt recognition that it is senseless, and unfair on future generations, our children and our grandchildren, to grow today and clean up later. That fundamental development dilemma, whereby development is pursued at the cost of the sustainable use of resources, was at the heart of Rio thinking before the summit and during it, and it must remain part of our thinking subsequent to the summit as well.</p>

I strongly agree with him: I think that some Governments and Parliaments sometimes struggle to know exactly what legislative steps they should take in this regard.

The test of whether it will be looked back on as a complete wash-out or a great triumph is what we then do with that outline concept, and whether we have the political will to use the mechanisms that have been established&#8212;not least the group that will start work in December&#8212;to flesh out the content and feed that into the wider review of the millennium development goals as they are reviewed and strengthened in the post-2015 framework.</p>

There is a pretty clear process. However, we just have to recognise that a summit in a world where power is shifting to different hemispheres and different continents is different from one that took place 20 years ago. Brazil now has authority and clout on the international stage that it did not have then; the G77 is organised as a caucus of developing countries, which was not quite the case 20 years ago, and they are rightly more demanding that their voice and voices should be heard. That is reflected in the more diverse push and pull that we witnessed at the Rio summit.</p>

Although, sadly, the Deputy Prime Minister is no longer with us&#8212;corporeally, at any rate&#8212;I was concerned, as I trust you were, at the widespread reports in the weekend press that he had vetoed any prospect of a referendum on the possible introduction of a proportional representation voting system for elections to a reformed upper House. Given the constitutional importance of such an issue and the motivation that it is clearly designed to help the Liberal Democrats retain a permanent stranglehold on future legislative processes, should not such announcements be made initially to this House rather than via the media?</p>

	<p pid="c.174.2/1">That was a scintillating polemic for the House to savour, but what I would say to the hon. Gentleman, whom I have known for 29 years this October, is that although the logic of his attempted point of order is compelling, it suffers as a point of order from the disadvantage that the premise on which the logic has been built is, in my judgment, misplaced. The reason I say that to the hon. Gentleman is that the Deputy Prime Minister was not announcing a change of Government policy but, as far as I can tell, merely reiterating the status quo. That will have to do for now, but all these matters will doubtless be explored eloquently, in detail and at length in the upcoming debates on House of Lords reform, to which I fancy the hon. Gentleman will wish to contribute.</p>

	<p pid="c.175.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes the forthcoming consultation on the restructuring of the secondary education system; further notes the proposals reported in the press on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-21">Thursday 21 June</phrase> of Government plans for replacing GCSEs with an O-Level and CSE system; believes that these proposals could, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, &#8216;lead to a two tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrap heap&#8217;; and calls on the Government to ensure any proposal for changes to the secondary education system are subject to approval by the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.175.3/3">In three years&#8217; time, the education leaving age will rise to 18. That change represents a huge challenge to schools and colleges up and down the country. How can the education system adapt to the challenge? How can we enable all children and young people to achieve their full potential? How do we ensure that young people have the skills and knowledge to succeed in life, including in the world of work?</p>
	<p pid="c.175.3/4">Earlier this month, the Secretary of State was advocating a return to Victorian-style rote learning in our primary schools. Now he wants to bring back a two-tier exam system, which his own party abolished more than 25 years ago. That is all from a Government who are making the biggest cuts to education spending since the 1950s. I am a great supporter of history, but I do not believe that we need a school system that is stuck in the past.</p>

	<p pid="c.175.5/1">I will give way shortly, but I want to develop my argument first.</p>
	<p pid="c.175.5/2">The most important ingredients of success in education are the quality of leadership and the quality of teaching and learning; the Secretary of State is nodding his assent. It is vital that those ingredients are backed by a credible set of qualifications. We support reforming the structure of the examination system to deal with unhealthy competition between exam boards. If that means a single exam board, we will consider those plans in detail, and I understand that the Select Committee is due to make proposals to deal with that precise challenge shortly. Sensible, thought-through and evidence-based measures to increase rigour and tackle grade inflation will have the full support of the Opposition, but let us be clear about the fundamental difference between us and the Education Secretary: the proposal to divide pupils at 14 into winners and losers.</p>
	<p pid="c.175.5/3">When the Deputy Prime Minister woke up in Rio last Thursday, he said about the Secretary of State&#8217;s proposals:</p>
	<p pid="c.175.5/4">&#8220;I am not in favour of anything that would lead to a two-tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrap heap. What you want is an exam system which is fit for the future&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.175.5/6">&#8220;doesn&#8217;t turn the clock back to the past&#8230;so it works for the many and not just&#8230;the few.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.176.1/1">Well read, I suppose. I must correct my earlier remark when I referred to Liberal Democrat colleagues because I think there is only one Liberal Democrat Member in the Chamber. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Two!&#8221;] Sorry, there are two. I was going to comment on the absence of the Liberal Democrat Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40113" name="Sarah Teather">the hon.

	<p pid="c.176.1/4">This week, according to the Government&#8217;s amendment on the Order Paper, the Government are calling for proposals that are approved by Parliament. May I welcome yet another U-turn by the Government to give Parliament a proper say, but may I suggest that as well as changing the process, the Secretary of State should change the substance of these leaked proposals? Today&#8217;s debate provides the House with an opportunity to reject a move to bring back a system that was created in the 1950s and abolished in the 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/5">These proposals were leaked just as pupils were sitting their GCSEs. As nervous and stressed young people were queuing up to sit hugely important exams, the Secretary of State was saying that those exams were worthless. How insulting to young people who have studied and revised so hard. How insulting to parents who have helped their children through the stress of exams and how insulting to our brilliant teachers who have worked so hard to prepare their pupils. Why are these changes being made now and why are they being rushed? Is the Secretary of State concerned that his other policies will result in a fall in school standards? Is it that he needs to mask the reduction in standards by abolishing the main existing measure of secondary school results? Is that why the Government are so determined to do this?</p>

We do not want that scenario back in our inner cities. We need to ensure parity for all at 16.</p>

	<p pid="c.177.2/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right and anticipates my next point. We know from analysis of the CSE that it was, in practice, a school-leaving certificate for the poor. In the decade after its abolition, the number of the poorest pupils staying on at school after 16 increased by a very significant 28%. The CSE and O-level system was designed more than half a century ago, when our society was completely different&#8212;there were far more unskilled jobs and typically children were split off into grammar schools and secondary moderns. A pupil at a comprehensive in 1971 was 25 times more likely to take CSEs than a grammar school pupil&#8212;perhaps not surprising. A pupil in a secondary modern school was 50 times more likely to take CSEs than a grammar school pupil.</p>

	<p pid="c.178.0/1">First, how would this solution help? As the hon. Lady knows, there are different international comparisons and analyses. The study carried out by the programme for international student assessment, PISA, to which she refers, shows one thing, but the trends in international mathematics and science study, TIMMSS, shows something quite different: English results in mathematics are much better in TIMMSS than in the PISA study. I take the challenge she sets out very seriously&#8212;we do need to do more and I am in favour of more rigour. What I do not understand is why that cannot be done by reform of the GCSE system. We can make GCSEs more rigorous. We do not have to go back to dividing children into sheep and goats at 14.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.0/2">The hon. Lady is an authority on these matters and I pay tribute to her hard work, especially on mathematics. The number of young people taking mathematics at A-level started to increase significantly under the Labour Government. We need to do more to accelerate that trend and to explore all the ways we might do that, but surely she welcomes the fact that the number taking A-level maths increased under the Labour Government?</p>

	<p pid="c.178.1/1">In fact, there was a massive drop in the number of students taking maths in 2000, when Labour introduced modular exams; that had a massively damaging effect. That number is now beginning to recover, which is indeed good news, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that the previous Government were responsible for the drop in the first place and the decline in standards relative to countries such as Germany? He still has not answered my question about how Germany managed to reform its system.</p>

	<p pid="c.178.2/1">Let us learn from other countries&#8217; systems. That is the point I was seeking to make. We recognised that there was an issue, which is why we addressed it and why, as the hon. Lady acknowledged, the number taking maths at A-level has started to increase, and not just since the change of Government in 2010; it predated that change of Government. When we debate these topics, it is important that we are balanced in our use of evidence. I am prepared to acknowledge the issue that she outlined as regards PISA, but I am sure she could acknowledge that we do a lot better in some of the other international research, including TIMSS.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/2">The <i>Financial Times</i> has done an in-depth analysis of the proposed new CSE. It says that it</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/3">&#8220;will tend to be an exam for poorer children&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/4">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/5">&#8220;There will be a geographical effect, too, with some areas switching heavily to it. . . The CSE will be a <i>northern </i>qualification&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/6">This matters. The Secretary of State is in danger of putting a cap on aspiration for poorer children and for those living in the poorer regions of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/7">In last week&#8217;s urgent question the Secretary of State told the House that we already have a two-tier system, but he knows that at present pupils who sit the simpler foundation papers for GCSE can still get a C. Indeed, if their coursework is good enough, they can even get a B.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/8">With the CSE system, they will have a qualification on their CV which suggests to employers that teachers thought they had low ability. There is a real danger that they will simply stop striving for success.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/9">The Labour Government started to narrow the gap in education between rich and poor. These proposals pose a real threat that the north-south divide will worsen and even fewer young people from the poorest families will stay on at school or go on to university. I am sure the Education Secretary has read the OECD&#8217;s research, which concluded that social mobility is lower in countries which</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/10">&#8220;group students into different curricula at early ages&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/11">Most scientific evidence now shows that teenagers&#8217; brains can change late in life, even up to the age of 16. Professor Cathy Price of University college London found that teenagers&#8217; IQs can jump by as much as 20 percentage points. She comments:</p>
	<p pid="c.178.2/12">&#8220;We have to be careful not to write off poorer performers at an early stage when in fact their IQ may improve significantly given a few more years.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.180.1/1">I will write to the hon. Gentleman with the results. I took O-level English. I think I got an A in literature and a B in language. When I was doing O-levels I had no way of testing the skills that the CBI tells us matter&#8212;no course work, no speaking and listening component; rather the questions often required fairly basic skills, such as summary and reading comprehension. That is one reason why I say that speaking skills should be a priority for all our state schools, as they are in so many of our primary schools. The Education Secretary observed recently that it was &#8220;morally indefensible&#8221; that some professions are dominated by pupils from private schools. I simply cannot see how bringing back CSEs will address that indefensible position. It will make it even worse.</p>

	<p pid="c.180.3/1">Anyone listening to this debate is probably not very interested in the progress of my thinking on these matters. They are probably slightly more interested in the opportunity for Members on both sides of the House to hold the Secretary of State to account, which is the purpose of today&#8217;s debate. However, I repeat that I do acknowledge that there is an issue of grade inflation. In an interview in January 2012, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/2">&#8220;It is important to recognise that it is not just grade inflation that is responsible for improvements in our schools. I do believe that our schools have got better, incrementally in some case, quickly in others, over the course of the last 15 years.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/3">So in fact we can reach a consensus on this. There has been grade inflation, but there was also significant improvement in our schools during the last 15 years, for 13 of which, as I recall, the Labour party was in government.</p>

	<p pid="c.180.5/2">I worry that the Government are ignoring the central issues in the debate. The system does need reform and improvement. Labour made changes in government. For example, we made the main measure of performance at key stage 4 include English and maths, addressed social mobility from early childhood with Sure Start and free nursery places, and focused on literacy and numeracy in our primary schools. I am proud that under Labour we began to see a narrowing of the</p>
	<p pid="c.180.5/3">attainment gap between rich and poor children. That is not me saying that; it is according to analysis published by the</p>
	<p pid="c.180.5/4" class="italic">Financial Times</p>
	<p pid="c.180.5/5">, conducted by Simon Burgess, professor of economics at Bristol university. He said that the Labour Government was</p>
	<p pid="c.180.5/6">&#8220;turning the tide on social mobility&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.5/7">His analysis looked at core GCSE qualifications and the number crunchers stripped out the effects of grade inflation. The outcome was a sustained improvement in the results achieved by children from the poorest neighbourhoods. The cause of that social mobility was certainly not changes to the exam system&#8212;sometimes they are needed&#8212;rather it was investment, more and better teachers and greater freedom for schools to innovate.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.1/1">I am drawing to a close.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/2">This debate strikes at the heart of the approach taken by this Secretary of State, a Secretary of State who favours dogma over evidence and pet projects over changes that work for the many. These proposals will introduce a two-tier system, a massive step backwards, closing off opportunity for thousands of young people, and a cap on aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/3">In Saturday&#8217;s edition of <i>The Times</i>, the Secretary of State&#8217;s former teacher, W. G. R. Bain, wrote:</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/4">&#8220;Although Michael Gove was once one of the brighter pupils in my form class, the top stream at selective Robert Gordon&#8217;s College, I am afraid that in the intervening years he has learnt little about hoi polloi&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/5">his phrase, not mine. He concluded that</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/6">&#8220;combative debating is his strength, not common sense&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.1/7">Frankly, I could not have put it better myself: no common sense, instead arrogance; no interest in the evidence, instead dogma; and no interest in the many, instead naked elitism. Those of us on the Opposition Benches believe in high standards for all. We have an opportunity today to consign the idea of a two-tier system to the scrap heap.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move an amendment, to leave out from &#8220;House&#8221; to the end of the Question and add:</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;notes the forthcoming consultation on the secondary school qualifications and curriculum framework; welcomes the opportunity to address the weaknesses of the system introduced by the previous Administration, which undermined confidence in standards, increased inequality and led to a reduction in the take-up of core subjects such as modern languages, history, geography and the sciences; and calls for proposals which are approved by Parliament and which are based on the principles of high standards for all, greater curriculum freedom, and a qualifications and curriculum framework which supports and stretches every child and which boosts social mobility.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/3">May I first congratulate the shadow Secretary of State on his kind words about Saturday&#8217;s edition of <i>The Times</i>, which will be welcomed in every part of the Gove household, particularly by Mrs Gove, whose column appears on that day? I am also grateful to him for paying such close attention to the words of Bill Bain&#8212;if only I had paid closer attention to his words when at Robert Gordon&#8217;s college&#8212;and I am sure that the alumni of the school will be grateful to him for his generous words.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/4">We are all grateful to the hon. Gentleman for securing the debate this afternoon and congratulate him on doing so. As an experienced former Schools Minister, he brings passion and fluency to consideration of these issues. He has also brought a degree of intellectual honesty to the debate, which is welcome&#8212;I do not think that we have ever heard an acknowledgment from the Labour Front Bench that there was grade inflation under Labour. That was not the case with his immediate predecessor as shadow Secretary of State, and it was certainly not when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the right hon. Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase> was Secretary of State. I think that it is important that we record this moment, because it seems the first occasion when there has been a genuine acknowledgment of one of the failures of Labour&#8217;s management of our curriculum and qualifications system.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/5">In a moment we will discuss the future and how we might reform our examination system and our curricula, but before that I want to note how striking it was that in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s speech, which I enjoyed and appreciated for its honesty and grace, he did not come forward with a single positive proposal for how to make our qualifications more rigorous. He acknowledged weaknesses, but at no point did he say that he would change things in any particular direction. There was no Labour policy or initiative and nothing progressive from that side of the House, merely criticism. Of course, he will have an opportunity in future debates to outline what he thinks on these questions but, at the moment, where thought and initiative should be there is still a vacuum, a hole in the air.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/6">Before we look to the future, let us consider the past and Labour&#8217;s record. As the shadow Secretary of State rightly said, there are aspects of Labour&#8217;s record that I acknowledge are good and wish to build on. I am looking forward to building consensus across the House on the growth of the academies programme, for example, the growth of Teach First and the importance of improving teacher training. But there are other areas where I fear that a wrong turning was taken, one of which relates to the curriculum and qualifications. In particular, as our amendment to the motion points out, we saw a flight away from the rigorous subjects that employers and universities value. Under Labour, the proportion of students taking history at GCSE dropped to just 31%, the number taking science subjects dropped by 5%, the number taking geography dropped by 15%, and the number taking foreign languages dropped by 34%. That was despite the shadow Secretary of State saying in May 2004, when he was a Minister in the Department for Education:</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/7">&#8220;In the knowledge society of the 21st century, language competence and intercultural understanding are not optional extras, they are an essential part of being a citizen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/8">That is presumably why in September 2004 he took modern foreign languages out of the national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.2/9">The reason why a drop and a deterioration in the numbers following those subjects matters is that they are critical to social mobility. Both parties in the coalition have made improving social mobility the long-term goal&#8212;the measure of the success&#8212;of the five years that we have in power, and we know that more students studying history, foreign languages, geography, physics, chemistry and biology means more students having a chance to do satisfying subjects at university and fulfilling jobs in the 21st century workplace.</p>

	<p pid="c.183.1/2">It is for that reason that we introduced the English baccalaureate measure, in the teeth of opposition from the Labour party&#8212;both sides of the coalition determined to redress that decline. What has the result been? In two years, we have already seen the numbers taking languages up by 21%; taking history at GCSE up by 26%; taking geography up by 70%; and taking physics, biology and chemistry up by more than 70%. What we have seen as a result of that determined change to the way in which we set aspiration for our young people is improved social mobility&#8212;Liberals and Conservatives working together in order to achieve it.</p>

	<p pid="c.183.3/1">I have enormous respect for the hon. Lady, who makes a very important point about Birmingham. It is the youngest city in Britain, and its multicultural traditions are part of its strength, but it is important to recognise in Birmingham that, although there are some excellent schools, such as Perry Beeches and Arthur Terry, there are some underperforming schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/2">The excellence of a school is not, however, related to the number of children who have English as an additional language; all research shows that such children are just as capable of succeeding as children from any background. What matters is the quality of the school, not the nature of the home background, and what matters for all children in the 21st century is developing the language skills that will enable them to take their place in university or in the modern workplace. That is why it was a disaster when language learning was dropped under the previous Government, and why it is so welcome that the coalition Government have seen it restored.</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/3">Some people will ask why, if performance in those core GCSEs that matter so much declined, the headline figures for GCSE performance improved under Labour? What was going on? What was filling that gap? The truth is that we had a growth in so-called equivalent exams, which were called vocational although most employers did not rate them, and which were called equivalent to one or more GCSEs when most employers and colleges did not believe that they were. They have been eloquently criticised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase>, by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> and by Professor Alison Wolf in her universally praised report on vocational qualifications. There was fantastic growth in low-level qualifications under Labour, most of which, she says, had</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/4">&#8220;little to no labour market value.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/5">In 2004, students were taking just 15,000 of those qualifications, and then the Minister for Schools changed the rules. The then Minister for Schools is now the hon.</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/6">Member for Liverpool, West Derby, and as a result of those changes a certificate in nail technology counted as two GCSEs, a diploma in horse care counted as four GCSEs and, by 2010, where previously 15,000 such qualifications had been pursued, 575,000 were being taken, crowding out real study, driving rigour to the margins and holding back social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/7">Incentives were created by government which, as Alison Wolf points out,</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/8">&#8220;deliberately steered institutions and, therefore, their students away from qualifications that might stretch (and reward) young people and towards qualifications that can be passed easily.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/9">She says also that, of the current cohort of children between the ages of 16 and 19,</p>
	<p pid="c.183.3/10">&#8220;at least 350,000 get little to no benefit&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.184.3/2">As the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby acknowledged, the two-tier system that he talks about is not something that the coalition Government are planning to introduce, but something that the Labour Government presided over and we want to tackle. The problem is that we already have a two-tier GCSE system. As he acknowledged but then skated over, we have two types of GCSE&#8212;foundation and higher tier&#8212;in English, maths and science. We have a two-tier system of first-class and second-class qualifications. The higher tier allows anyone who takes a paper to get an A, B or C, and so on; the foundation paper is explicitly designed to limit student success. In ordinary circumstances, it is impossible for a student who enters for a foundation-tier paper to achieve a grade higher than C. It is impossible, in other words, for thousands of students to achieve the most basic grade that is respected by employers and will in many colleges allow them to progress to A-levels. The very act of entering a child for a foundation-tier paper at GCSE is a way of saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get above yourself&#8212;A-levels are not for you.&#8221; Even colleges that set a C grade as an entry requirement often demand a grade C from a higher-tier paper because they treat higher-tier and lower-tier GCSEs as separate qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is absolutely correct that we need to have higher aspirations for all students. That is why, in our forthcoming consultation on how we can improve GCSEs and get world-class qualifications, we will suggest that we end the tiering of papers and ensure that this barrier&#8212;this cap on aspiration&#8212;is removed. That is genuine radicalism that embodies greater aspiration for all students. After 13 years of Labour when there was a cap on aspiration, under this coalition Government social mobility is at last advanced.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.2/1">Given that practically all the studies show that the differences between children when they are first sent to school at the age of five are not changed by schools of any nature or under any exam system, why does the Secretary of State think that the introduction of his proposed reforms will change the life chances of the poorest children?</p>

	<p pid="c.185.3/1">I think that their life chances can change. I usually agree with the right hon. Gentleman on almost every issue, but in this area I differ with him. I do not believe that birth or even the early years determine a child&#8217;s fate. I have seen children from very similar backgrounds, often from troubled and chaotic homes, go into primary schools and then on to secondary schools with very different qualities of teaching and, as a result, have their outcomes transformed. The right hon. Gentleman has been a fantastic advocate for the growth of the academies programme, including in his own constituency. His actions suggest to me that while he is, of course, as determined as I am to improve the early years, he recognises that we can intervene at every stage to help children and young people to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.4/1">Of course we need to intervene at every stage as effectively as possible. While all of us, thank goodness, have seen examples of children escaping their circumstances such as those he cites, the truth is that if we look at students as classes we do not free whole groups of pupils.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.5/1">It is absolutely right that we make sure that we recognise that children are individuals and that teaching should, as far as possible, be personalised towards them. Children will not only have different abilities in different subjects but will mature at different stages.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.5/2">That is one of the reasons why we wanted to ensure that we developed qualifications that are not only without the tiers that set a cap on aspiration but can be taken at different points in a child&#8217;s career. At the moment, far too many children fail to secure a GCSE pass in English and maths at the age of 16 and never manage to secure a meaningful qualification in maths or English thereafter. We want to learn from Singapore, where students at the age of 16, then 17, and then 18, secure those passes.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.5/3">We must not give up on children simply because they have not reached an appropriate level at the age of 16. That is why we are reforming post-16 education and why we are placing a requirement on students who have not secured those qualifications at the age of 16 to secure them at 17 or 18. The generation that had been written off under Labour is at last, under the coalition Government, receiving support.</p>

	<p pid="c.186.1/2">There are two poles in this debate, neither of which I am happy with. One pole holds that only a minority of about 20% or 25% will ever be able to pass academic qualifications&#8212;the A stream, the elite. The other view, which was incarnated in Labour education policy in the past, is that to ensure that a majority of children pass the qualifications, we need to make them less demanding. I reject both those views. I think that more children can succeed if we make our exams more demanding, because we have a higher degree of aspiration and ambition for all our children.</p>
	<p pid="c.186.1/3">I understand why the right hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby and other Opposition Members find it so difficult to grasp this point. Sorry, he is an hon. Gentleman&#8212;there is no cap on his aspiration or ambition. They find it difficult because the only way in which they felt that they could succeed was to lower the bar.

There is also a two-tier system between this nation and other nations because other countries have more testing examinations at the ages of 16, 17 and 18, whereas we have incarnated low aspirations in the way in which we judge our young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a characteristically acute point. One problem with the current system is that GCSEs are not, in many cases, adequate preparation for A-levels, and A-levels are not adequate preparation for university, particularly when our students are compared with those from other jurisdictions. That is because, notwithstanding the incremental improvement in state education over the past 15 years, other countries have reformed their education systems faster than we have reformed ours. We have to match them and that means reform.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.6/1">The Secretary of State wants more rigorous exams that more people pass. That is an aspiration that we would all share, but it is not immediately obvious how it is to be brought about. Today, 42% of children do not get five good GCSEs including English and maths. If we make the tests more difficult, it is not immediately obvious how more people will pass them. I welcome that he is aiming higher and that we will have more rigour, but we need more detail.

	<p pid="c.187.7/1">It is perfectly clear what we need to do to get more children to pass more exams: we must press ahead with the reforms that we have introduced to create more academies and free schools, to get better teachers in our schools, to have continuous professional development in which we invest in the very best people, to expand the Teach First programme, and to ensure that we have a relentless focus on raising the bar. Complacency on performance in our schools will lead us only to continue to be backmarkers. One point I would make to the Chair of the Education Committee and the House is that some schools manage to do every bit as well as schools in Singapore by getting 80% or more of their students to five good GCSEs or equivalents. We should ask ourselves why more schools are not doing as well as them. The whole point of the Government&#8217;s education reforms is to ensure that we raise standards for all.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.7/2">The Chair of the Committee asked what the Government will do to change things. We have already taken some steps. We have banned modules and resits, and introduced</p>
	<p pid="c.187.7/3">the English baccalaureate to put a stress on rigorous subjects. It is not clear whether the Opposition agree with us. We have explicitly said that we believe there is a case for one exam board per subject in English, maths and science. The Opposition inched towards agreeing with us, and I hope we can reach a consensus.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.7/4">One problem I have in attempting to tease out where the Opposition stand in order to build the consensus we all want is that whenever the Government put forward a case for reform, it is difficult to know where the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby stands.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.1/3">&#8220;The fatalists who say that countries with strong academic school traditions cannot create, in a short timescale, quality vocational education institutions and pathways with real prestige should take note. It is being done abroad and must be done here.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/4">It is being done here through the introduction of university technical colleges, and through the development of studio schools, which were introduced by the Government of Andrew Adonis and expanded massively by this one. It is also being done with a review of vocational qualifications, which will mean that apprenticeships are at last possessed of the rigour that all hon. Members might expect, but which did not happen under the previous Government. Thanks to the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, we have extended a requirement so that all apprenticeships will be for 12 rather than just six months. We have also extended the important work-related learning in apprenticeships. I acknowledge that there are improvements to be made, but the Holt and Richard reviews will ensure that we make them.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/5">If those improvements are to be enduring and if we are to succeed, if the university technical colleges and studio schools are to succeed and take root, and if the changes we are making in the academies programme are to succeed, such as the welcome addition of the Liverpool college&#8212;an independent fee-paying school&#8212;to the state sector, which was welcomed graciously by the hon.

	<p pid="c.189.4/1">I have explained exactly what we will do, which is to strengthen GCSEs and world-class qualifications. Nothing we want to do is a step backwards; everything we want to do is a step towards the high-class qualifications that other countries have. I have ruled out as clearly as I can any two-tier system. I have said that we want to move to one tier and a set of high-level qualifications. I can bring clarity to the Government&#8217;s position but not to the Opposition&#8217;s.</p>

	<p pid="c.189.8/4">languages in 2004, he said: &#8220;I had mixed views.&#8221; Given this lack of consistency, can we be certain that his position now, in backing modern foreign languages, is a consistent one?

	<p pid="c.190.6/1">I know that the right hon. Gentleman wants everything to be black and white, but sometimes there is nuance in these debates. One of the equivalents I certainly do not support&#8212;this is the issue I tried to intervene on earlier&#8212;is changing some of the diplomas, including the engineering diploma. The excellent JCB academy, the first universal technical college, has lobbied me strongly to say that it disagrees with how the Government have downgraded the engineering diploma. There is a real risk that vocational and practical subjects will be crowded out of our schools at a time when we need more young people getting good qualifications in engineering and other areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.190.7/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for answering about one of the more than 1,700 vocational qualifications. So he supports the engineering diploma being an equivalent. Does he support nail technology or horse husbandry or any of the others? Again, answer comes there none.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.7/2">The hon. Gentleman says that there is nuance in his position. I say, rather than nuance, there is an absence of clarity, without which we cannot secure consensus.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.7/3">Does he believe that we should continue with foundation and higher-tier GCSEs? Yes or no? A simple nod would suffice. Again, answer comes there none, but we probably know what he thinks. When he was a Minister in the Department for Education and Skills in 2003, the &#8220;Excellence and Opportunity&#8221; White Paper said:</p>
	<p pid="c.190.7/4">&#8220;the GCSE has become a qualification at two levels: Level 2 (or grades A*&#8211;C) is viewed by the public as success, while Level 1 (or grades D&#8211;G) is seen as failure. For many young people achieving Level 1 is demotivating. Some young people prefer not to reveal that they have taken GCSEs than admit to a lower grade. This undermines motivation and discourages staying on&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.7/5">That was the view of the hon. Gentleman and his Department in 2003, but they took no action to deal with the problem. At last, 10 years later, the coalition Government are taking action to end the problem of failure, to ensure that we no longer have an examination system that is demotivating and to end a system that discourages staying on.</p>

	<p pid="c.191.0/1">Does the Secretary of State accept that with the foundation and higher-tier system there was always the opportunity for pupils to transfer, and there was always a motivation to try to drive pupils to get better than a D by getting a C? How will the new system of separating a CSE and an O-level examination allow a pupil to be pushed so that they can attain the higher level&#8212;the O-level qualification&#8212;if they have already started on a CSE syllabus, which is significantly different?</p>

	<p pid="c.191.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for asking her question. I am a man of my convictions, and my convictions are that we need to improve our GCSE system. That is why we have outlined proposals that will ensure that we change the way in which children sit qualifications at the age of 16. In place of a two-tier system, with GCSEs split between foundation and higher-tier, we will have one qualification for all students. In place of competing exam boards where there is a race to the bottom instituted under the Labour Government, we will have exam boards that will be asked to compete to go to the top, and all those exam boards will be asked to produce qualifications that are more rigorous.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.5/2">Instead of 60% of students being assumed to succeed and 40% being written off, we will set a benchmark whereby at least 80% and a rising proportion of students succeed over time. Instead of a flight away from rigorous subjects like history, geography and modern foreign languages, physics, chemistry and biology, we will ensure that those subjects are incentivised in league tables and</p>
	<p pid="c.191.5/3">accountability measures. We will ensure as a result of these changes that the drift towards mediocrity that the last Government&#8217;s qualification system incarnated is finally addressed.</p>

I believe we can ensure that more children succeed by ensuring that the policies of the coalition Government are implemented with vigour and energy.

	<p pid="c.193.0/1">I think that we must give the Secretary of State&#8217;s speech eight out of 10 for style, but nought out of 10 for content. It was a very good speech which, I am afraid, did not deal with the issue in hand at all. The Secretary of State was asked on numerous occasions whether the <i>Daily Mail </i>had reported him correctly, and he was completely evasive. He was asked again and again how the abolition of GCSEs would raise the bar, and I have to say that his responses were divisive, evasive and at times even destructive.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/2">What is so important about GCSEs is that they are examinations for all pupils of all abilities. They were introduced in 1988 by Margaret Thatcher and Kenneth Baker in response to huge unhappiness, largely among parents. Those of us who were in the education system at that time will remember that it was middle-class parents whose children were sent to underfunded secondary moderns and forced down the route of CSEs who brought about the abolition of CSEs and the introduction of the GCSEs that we have now, which have brought together the best of what was in the CSEs and the old O-levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/3">That approach was welcomed by the whole education community, but it seems likely that it will be abolished on the say-so of the Secretary of State, who has apparently not consulted anyone on his proposal. As far as I am aware, there has been no consultation with pupils, parents, teachers or the wider education community. The Secretary of State convened a two-year curriculum review group consisting of the great and the good to consider the issue of the curriculum, but appears subsequently to have completely ignored everything said by that group, choosing instead to develop an education policy that has no evidence base and is founded on personal prejudice.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/4">So what is the evidence behind the Secretary of State&#8217;s review? We have heard a lot from him about our cascading down the OECD PISA scales for English, maths and science. I am sorry, but no matter how many times he says that, it is simply not true. In the three years leading up to 2007 many more countries entered their data in the PISA tables, so the outcomes in 2007 did not measure like with like. When the Secretary of State talks of cascading down the scales, what he is really talking about are a couple of percentage points in a table that would now include many more countries than it did at the time when it was last drawn up. That is not measuring like with like. If the Secretary of State were a teacher instead of a journalist looking for the best negative headline, he would understand that.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/5">The Secretary of State used Singapore for his evidence base. The Education Committee visited Singapore last year just to see what was happening there. It must be said that there are many good things in the Singapore system, but what he failed to tell us was that in Singapore education is not free, and is not compulsory for children beyond the age of 11. When PISA measures the outcomes of 16-year-olds in England against those of 16-year-olds in Singapore, it is measuring the outcomes of all 16-year-olds in England against those of some 16-year-olds in Singapore. Again, like is not being measured with like.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/6">In Singapore the curriculum is restricted to English, maths and science, and there is no creativity whatsoever. Here we have a broad, advanced curriculum. Again, like is not being measured with like. The Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/7">failed to tell us that in Singapore seven out of eight children have up to three hours of additional tuition every day paid for by the parents, over and above the tuition that is received in schools. So again, like is not being measured with like. He also failed to tell us that the Singapore system is one of the most centralist education systems in the world, where the Minister for education dictates what is taught, how it is taught and when it is taught. It goes so far that head teachers do not even apply for places in schools; they are allocated a school and they are moved on every three years&#8212;and they have no say whatever about which school they move on to.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/8">In using Singapore to provide evidence for his plans, the Secretary of State is comparing our state-funded, diverse, teacher-led, innovative, autonomous system with a broad and balanced curriculum that caters for all children up to the age of 16 and beyond with an almost Soviet-style centralised system where education is not free, compulsion ends at 11 years of age and there is a highly restrictive curriculum. That is not measuring like with like.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/9">The Secretary of State also looked for his evidence base to polls telling him that parents want to see a return to O-levels. He may well cite the recent YouGov poll that shows that 60% of those who are old enough to have sat the old O-level want to see a return to a two-tier system. However, that is what we would expect from any poll that asked questions of people over 40; they hanker back to what they know. The YouGov poll also shows, however, that 40% of those who sat O-levels do not want to see a return to a two-tier system, and that 65% of those who took GCSEs do not want to see a return to a two-tier system either.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/10">I accept that the system we have is not perfect, but I do not believe that the answer is to return to qualifications that were designed a lifetime ago for a world that no longer exists in which children without qualifications were able to find jobs in low-skill industries&#8212;in factories, mines, shipbuilding, steel-making and agriculture. That world no longer exists. Today&#8217;s young people need skills that were not previously taught: resilience and reasoning skills, negotiation skills, team-working, speaking skills, interpersonal skills. Those are the skills that employers are telling the Education Committee that they need. They are taught in private schools; we should be making time for them in our state schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/11">In designing our state education system, we should say, &#8220;If it&#8217;s not good enough for my child, it&#8217;s not good enough for your child.&#8221; That should be our guiding principle in designing an education system, rather than, &#8220;Outcomes for some at the expense of others.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.194.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate, and to rebut allegations of fatalism thrown at me by the Secretary of State. I hope I am no more of a fatalist than he is. I have observed in many of our debates that able politicians, on both sides of the House, are brilliant at describing and critiquing the inheritance from the Labour party and at painting a picture of the kind of country we would like to be, but our job in this House is to address the third aspect and examine the route map to get from position A&#8212;not very good&#8212;to position B, or nirvana</p>
	<p pid="c.194.0/2">and where we want to be. Too often in our education debates in this Chamber, we spend an awful lot of time on aspects one and two, and not a lot on the third aspect.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.0/3">Following the Secretary of State&#8217;s speech, I am a little clearer about what his plans are. I think he has said&#8212;I hope he will intervene on me if I am incorrect&#8212;that the <i>Daily Mail </i>was mistaken, and that there is not going to be a return to a two-tier system. He did not, for whatever reason, try to spell this out, but it sounded as if he was talking about a more rigorous GCSE. It is progress that the Labour spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase>, acknowledges that there was grade inflation during his party&#8217;s time in office, and the Secretary of State makes powerful points about equivalences. The Government have certainly had my support in tackling that and in tightening up in various ways, such as by removing entirely the vocational qualifications that Alison Wolf identified as offering no real labour value to people.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.0/4">So what is the vision? If we were just talking about a more rigorous GCSE with a removal of the perverse incentives to dumb down over time&#8212;it has now been acknowledged that that was the case, even by Labour&#8212;I think there would almost be cross-House consensus. There is a recognition by Labour that it did not get everything right, even if Labour Members cannot quite bring themselves to say that yet; it is fair enough for the Secretary of State to tease the shadow Secretary of State for his failure to do so. It seems that the Labour party is beginning to recognise that a lot of the Secretary of State&#8217;s moves towards rigour have been correct. However, if we are to have a beefed-up GCSE, and if we are not moving towards a system that is more two-tier than what we have now, I would like to see more detail. I know that a consultation paper is coming, but it seems disappointing that we did not get more detail from the Secretary of State today.</p>

	<p pid="c.195.2/1">I am very grateful to the Chairman of the Education Committee for giving me the opportunity to ask the question that I was hoping to ask of the Secretary of State. Given that both sides now seem to accept that there has been a problem of grade inflation, could we pay a little bit of attention to the marks that underlie the grades? One of the problems that I felt many years ago with the introduction of grades for O-levels, rather than marks, was that it did not matter if somebody got 70%, 80% or 90%: anybody who reached a certain level&#8212;70%, I think&#8212;still got the same top grade. This was the beginning of an inflationary process. Would not the stating of actual marks&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.195.4/1">Fortunately, my hon. Friend takes me to the issue I wanted to address next, which is the administration of examinations. Unfortunately, however, I am unable to comment on that now. The Education Committee has conducted a long inquiry into precisely that issue, looking at the trade-offs between a single board, competition between boards, franchising by subject</p>
	<p pid="c.195.4/2">and various other ways of cutting it. We have concluded our report, but because of the examination season&#8212;whoever leaked this story to the press last week was obviously less sensitive than us to the fact that children were taking exams&#8212;we decided to delay the publication of our report until <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-03">3 July</phrase>. So, I am afraid that, until then, I cannot engage in that issue. However, we have looked at it in depth, and I hope I am not in contempt of Parliament if I say that the Committee came up with a unanimous recommendation and report. I hope that those on both sides of the House will wait until at least <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-03">3 July</phrase> before allowing any of their opinions to solidify further.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.4/3">If the Secretary of State is talking about a more rigorous GCSE system&#8212;whether it is given a new name or not&#8212;which is effectively a single examination system, as we have now, that would rather destroy the entire premise of my speech, leaving me short for words.</p>

	<p pid="c.196.1/1">Time for a coffee and to let others speak.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/2">However, over the last two years the Government have made a series of announcements looking to put greater rigour into the system. They announced the ending of modularisation of GCSEs, tackling the culture of re-sits, ending equivalences and promoting the English baccalaureate, which, of course, rewards those students who achieve good GCSEs in English, maths, two sciences, a language and either history or geography. However, at the end of that process, if the leak is to be believed&#8212;I am in a state of confusion now&#8212;they suddenly announced the scrapping of GCSEs altogether. That does not seem terribly coherent.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/3">Just last June the Secretary of State said the following about GCSEs:</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/4">&#8220;So next year the floor will rise to 40 per cent and my aspiration is that by 2015 we will be able to raise it to 50 per cent. There is no reason&#8212;if we work together&#8212;that by the end of this parliament every young person in the country can&#8217;t be educated in a school where at least half of students reach this basic academic standard.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/5">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/6">&#8220;A GCSE floor standard is about providing a basic minimum expectation to young people that their school will equip them for further education and employment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/7">That was the direction of travel then; suddenly, a year later&#8212;if we are to believe the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#8212;that has been scrapped. On the other hand, if I understood correctly what the Secretary of State said today, that was an entirely false idea and there is no plan to do such a thing at all.</p>

	<p pid="c.196.2/1">I think we are all trying to decipher what the Secretary of State said. Is it the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s understanding that the Secretary of State said that he would expect 80% of pupils to sit this new single-paper GCSE, and if so, what does he think ought to happen to the other 20%?</p>

	<p pid="c.196.3/1">As I have said, I think that increased rigour throughout the system is necessary and important. I think that the accountability system for schools needs to be changed so that it does not have perverse outcomes, such as putting people on courses that lead nowhere but</p>
	<p pid="c.196.3/2">allow the institution to meet its benchmark&#8212;we on the Committee have been critics of that for some time. Perhaps the announcement, or the leak, suggests a change in view by the Secretary of State on that front.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.3/3">If we look across the system, where we need more rigour and we need to ensure that we end the perverse incentives, we find that the biggest problem we face in a global knowledge economy, where the first rung of the ladder keeps rising up, is what we do about people who are not getting those basic skills and that basic education. The Government have two priorities for education: raising standards for all; and closing the gap. Those are right, but when setting priorities it is terribly important to show what the top priority is. I am yet to understand how the changes specifically will help the least able, but then again I am unclear as to what exactly the proposal is&#8212;even if I have not quite fallen to the level of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon.

	<p pid="c.197.1/1">That is a lot better than I did, so I will leave it there.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.1/2">Ofqual now has a statutory duty to ensure two things, one of which is that we maintain standards over time. We shall see whether it does its job right; it is relatively newly empowered and we need to give it the chance to see whether it can reverse this grade inflation and keep us up there with our international competition. Has it said that there needs to be a restructuring of the examination system, not necessarily the administration of it, but the whole quality of it and the possible tiering of it? I would like to hear from the Secretary of State about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.1/3">I have only a minute left, so I shall finish by repeating that the central problem is what we do about the young people, all too many of whom are now not in education, employment or training&#8212;NEET&#8212;and are being left behind. A more rigorous system is great, but the only way to raise standards ultimately&#8212;this is the only thing that matters in education&#8212;is through quality of teaching. We need to ensure consistent, high-quality teaching and an excellent institution for everyone, everywhere. At the moment, there are all sorts of incentives in the accountability system to focus on borderline pupils at the expense of those at the bottom, and within the system for people to move from a school that is very challenging to one in the leafier suburbs&#8212;a much more congenial place for many people to teach in. We need to look at re-gearing our whole system in a way that the Labour Government failed to do, despite efforts in that direction, to ensure that we provide opportunity for all, because both socially and economically we cannot afford to have so many children left behind, unable to get on the first rung of the economic ladder and thus be full members of our society. If any proposals from the Secretary of State are driven by that central insight, he can certainly look forward to my support.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.2/1">In 2006, New College school in my constituency was the worst secondary school in England for truancy, the worst in the value-added league tables, and fifth from bottom overall for GCSE</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/2">results. Just one in 10 pupils taking GCSEs at the school scored five grade Cs or better, while the truancy rate was running at more than 10 times the national average. I was therefore very proud when last Friday New College was named by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust as being in the top 10% of improving schools in the country. The number of children getting five A to C grades at GCSE including in English and Maths has gone up by 450%, and the number getting five A to C grades overall has gone up by a staggering 700%.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/3">Jane Brown, the head teacher at New College, says that three key things have helped it to achieve those phenomenal results, and that the first and foremost is having the right teachers&#8212;moving on those who were not up to scratch and replacing them with the very best. The second thing is the focus and financial support from the national challenge programme, which has enabled New College to get external support, including from the ex-head of education at Nottingham, and pay for additional resources, such as tutors to give intense one-on-one support in English and Maths. The third thing is not allowing the school to get blown off track by different Government initiatives, and instead focusing consistently and relentlessly on what really matters to help children learn, aspire and achieve. The teachers, support staff, volunteers and students at New College deserve huge congratulations on their hard work, commitment and success. Although they are rightly proud of their achievements, they are not complacent, and they are determined to make even greater improvements in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/4">I have spoken to Jane and to some of the other heads at secondary schools in Leicester West about the Secretary of State&#8217;s plans&#8212;or, at least, reported plans&#8212;to change GCSEs. They think&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that a single exam board could be a positive step to help tackle unhelpful competition between exam boards and stop some heads thinking, &#8220;Which exam will get the best results for my school?&#8221; rather than, &#8220;How can we give our students the best education for life?&#8221; Achieving A grades in GCSEs should be really demanding, and with a single syllabus there is no reason that cannot be achieved. That is something we should be considering.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/5">Jane and the other heads do not support a return to a two-tier system where children are told at age 14 what they can and cannot achieve. Telling some children before they have had a chance fully to develop that they are not good enough to do O-levels will not boost their self-esteem, but crush it. Telling them they can manage only CSEs, which will inevitably be a less valued qualification, will not raise their achievement, but cap it. We should not be putting a ceiling on children&#8217;s aspirations; we should be blasting those ceilings away.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/6">This proposal is a terribly backwards step from a Secretary of State who does not seem to understand what it takes to help children from chronically deprived backgrounds to aspire and achieve. Jane Brown, who has proved through her hard work and effort what can and must be done to turn schools around, says labelling children as failures so early would be disastrous. Instead of helping schools such as New College, which have created a &#8220;yes you can, yes you will&#8221; culture for all the students all the way through to the end of year 11, the Government&#8217;s proposals will return us to the days when some children ended up believing that they could not and that they were failures, particularly if they came from very</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/7">disadvantaged backgrounds. That is why I urge the Government, in the strongest possible terms, to rethink their plans. If the Secretary of State would like to visit New College and see what it really takes to turn around a school that was in a terrible state some years ago, so that it is now doing really well for the people I was elected to represent, I am sure that he would be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.0/1">Young people are working harder in our schools than ever before, guided by probably the best ever generation of teachers. Certainly, lessons are planned and progress tracked in a way that it never was when most of us were at school. Young people are also examined more, at considerable cost to our schools&#8212;the average cost of exams to maintained secondary schools was &#163;44,000 in 2003 and &#163;96,000 by 2010. Those pupils and teachers are being let down by a system that has allowed the erosion of confidence in their qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.0/2">There is massive pressure on schools, as we all know, from the five-plus C-plus measurement in league tables. Although it is true, as many right hon. and hon. Members have said, that there have been real improvements in educational attainment, it is also true that ever since those league table ladders were created, ingenious schools have found ever more ingenious ways of getting up them, aided and abetted by public policy and the exams industry, with things such as double awards, short courses, half GCSEs, new subjects and, of course, the granddaddy of them all, equivalents, which make a 19 percentage point difference in the league tables. If equivalents are included, 75% of children get five or more GCSEs at grade C or above, but that goes down to 56% if those equivalents are taken out.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.0/3">Like economic growth, improvements in grade have both a real part and an inflationary part. The real growth comes from better teaching, better teachers and more engaged parents, and I think we have see ample evidence of those things.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.2/1">I am always happy to hear from distinguished maths teachers, but I am not quite sure how the hon. Lady&#8217;s intervention relates to or contradicts what I just said. I was saying that there have clearly been real improvements, but I do not think there is anyone left, including that distinguished maths teacher, who doubts that on top of those real improvements there has been significant grade inflation, as acknowledged by the shadow Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.2/2">There are four key elements to the grade inflation. First, there has been the gradual easing of what we used to call the syllabus&#8212;now called the specification&#8212;on the part of the exam board. Secondly, at the school end, there has been teaching to the test. Thirdly, there have been all sorts of elements in the design of examinations, including modularity or what is now called unitising, early takes, re-sits, the use of calculators and so on.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.2/3">Fourthly&#8212;this sounds a bit dull and technical but it is very important&#8212;there is the statistical tolerance in the results. Every year, there is rightly a normalisation to say what results, for example, a key stage 4 cohort should get relative to what they achieved at key stage 2, with perhaps a 1% tolerance either way on a finding&#8212;but of course the tolerance only ever goes up. That is the most pure form of grade inflation.</p>

	<p pid="c.200.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making these points about how people work within the rules to maximise the effect, but even when I was at school there were children who were thought to be marginal when it came to getting an O-level and were dissuaded because it was thought that they would skew the results and do the school down. Let us not pretend that this is something new.</p>

	<p pid="c.200.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is very youthful looking but I am not sure the league tables were in place when he was at school, so I find that point slightly confusing.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.1/2">Does it matter that there has been grade inflation? I think we have all heard from higher education institutions, employers in our constituencies and members of the public that it does matter. One witness who gave evidence to the Education Committee&#8217;s exams inquiry said they did not believe that employers expect to be able to compare exam results over time, but I have news for him: that is exactly what employers, higher education institutions and parents expect to be able to do, and quite justifiably so. However, the system does not support them in doing that. Although there have been many factors at play with grade inflation, there are three root causes among which there is interplay: the pressure on schools to deliver the results; the competitive land grab for volume market share on behalf of the competing exam boards; and a too malleable system that attempts to put everything on a single scale when everything does not necessarily fit together.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.1/3">I think we have moved on a good way in this debate. Over the past few days, the phrase we have heard most often on this subject has been about not wanting to return to a two-tier system, but increasingly there is a recognition that there are two tiers now, with 40% of youngsters being left behind. One could even argue that there is a third tier, with the young people who are put on to other qualifications that are of so little value to them in later life. Even in the purer sense, within a single-subject GCSE there are the two tiers of the foundation level and the higher level. Although this has been talked about much today, it is in many ways the best kept secret in education. I keep finding, when I talk to the parents of 14 and 15-year-old pupils, that they are not aware of that distinction. In many ways O-levels and CSEs never went away&#8212;they were just rebranded, but into one thing.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.1/4">Let us take the example of GCSE maths. If someone is entered for GCSE maths at foundation level, that decision will be taken when they are in year 10 and the highest grade they can then achieve is a grade C. That sounds very much like getting a CSE grade 1 in the 1980s. And it is not just maths. Other subjects that are tiered include biology, physics, chemistry, general science, classical civilisation, Latin, English literature, English language, geography and modern foreign languages&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.200.1/5">almost every one of the core academic subjects that most of us did at school, with the single exception of history.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.1/1">I have a great deal of respect for the hon. Lady, who is an erstwhile colleague of ours on the Select Committee, but I am not proposing a return to anything from the past. What we must do is build an exam and qualification system that is fit for the future and reflects the new reality in which the participation age is 18, not 16. We must make sure that all young people can reach their potential at 15 to 16 and that if they have not done so by that point, particularly in key subjects such as English and Maths, they go on to do so at 16 to 18 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.3/1">I am sorry, but I am running very short of time.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/2">There is a bunch of complications in this two-tier system&#8212;for example, it applies to some subjects but not others, and there are even subjects for which students can enter one paper at foundation level and still score a grade B or A. There might be good reasons for all that, but one thing this system is not is clear. I understand the argument that all must have prizes, and in some ways that seems like a good thing, but it does young people no favours to kid them that the worth of the qualifications they are taking is greater than it really is. Instead, we must strive so that all merit prizes. We should aspire to the vast majority of children getting those key subjects aged 15 and 16, but as I said in reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase>, there must be the facility to return to them at age 16 to 18. One of the key points in the Wolf report was the lack of post-16 focus in our country compared with others on English and maths in particular&#8212;subjects that command a huge premium in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.6/1">The Secretary of State ducked and dived round the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#8217;s ring like a bantamweight, but that did not disguise the fact that he has still not this afternoon come out and denied the newspaper&#8217;s central thesis of a return to CSEs. The reality of a return to a form of CSEs and a form of selection is a return to educational apartheid. The Secretary of State, like many others, including me, went through a selective system and did well out of it; we went there and got the T-shirt, but I will never forget</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/2">the shiver that went down my spine as I did my 11-plus and nor will many others. The truth is that that system failed too many of our young people, and 20 years as an Open university tutor taught me that the backs of many of the people who came to a second chance with the Open university were scarred by that experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/3">When the shadow Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase>, talks about a cap on aspiration, he is absolutely right. In 2010, the Secretary of State said that Dickens and other authors should be studied in English lessons to improve young people&#8217;s grasp of the English language. As this is the year of Dickens, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will reflect on the words of the Ghost of Christmas Present to Scrooge in &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221;:</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/4">&#8220;Oh God. to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/5">It is the hungry brothers and hungry sisters in the dust we need to be concerned with.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/6">The Secretary of State ducked elegantly around the subject, but I know how important GCSEs have been in my Blackpool constituency&#8212;an area with low skills and historically modest academic achievements. They give students the ability to bridge the academic and vocational divide and to develop skills in creative, leisure and tourism activities that are vital to keep people in the local economy, and the flexibility of mind that comes from coursework as well as exams. What use to them would CSEs be? What use, for example, would CSEs be in special schools? That is another aspect the Secretary of State should take into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/7">My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State rightly referred to the comments by Chris Cook in the <i>Financial Times</i> and I shall not expand on them, except to say that Mr Cook made the important point:</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/8">&#8220;Take a look at the belt from Liverpool to Hull&#8212;the CSE towns of tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/9">Blackpool will be one of those towns and I have no wish to see it go into the Secretary of State&#8217;s pot.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/10">The Secretary of State says he is a man of convictions, and I agree. He is guilty as charged, and the charges should include the following: scrapping vocational diplomas in the system regardless of the lack of concrete plans to involve business in the curriculum; introducing an English baccalaureate that gave no space to vocational education; creating havoc in the careers system by taking &#163;200 million out of face-to-face communication; failing to have any policies on the sort of life skills and communication skills that were discussed earlier; and not listening to his colleagues in other Departments, not least the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, on vocational issues. The Secretary of State spoke about world skills. Would the WorldSkills people who won gold medals for Britain last October benefit under his two-tier system? Absolutely not.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/11">Like Robert Louis Stevenson, the Secretary of State was born in Edinburgh. Perhaps that explains why, from time to time, he appears to resemble one of Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s famous characters, Jekyll and Hyde. One day he can craft an eloquent paean to vocational aspiration, but the next day he talks about micro-management, which is not what we want to hear. Young people and schools are not train sets to be broken up every few years and re-arranged in a different pattern.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/12">Both the Secretary of State and his Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase> sit on the Front Bench like relics from the past. As Talleyrand said of the Bourbons, they have forgotten nothing and they have learned nothing. They have forgotten nothing about the failures of the past, but they have learned nothing, as is clear from the way they wish to turn back the clock.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/13">The Secretary of State spoke of being a radical and spoke in the tone of a mad Maoist. I do not know if it is possible to be a mad Maoist Bourbon, but he is making a passable attempt at it. I do not know whether it is a leadership manoeuvre or the latest quaffing of the potion from R L Stevenson that turns him periodically into Mr Hyde. I do not know and, frankly, I do not care. What I care about passionately, as all Members of the House should, is that the life chances of hundreds of thousands of our young people should not be jeopardised by his &#8220;Mad Monk&#8221; half-hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/14">If the Secretary of State wants to look at reforming GCSEs, at the balance between coursework and examinations, and how we make GCSEs work properly, we can help him with that. He could do worse than turn, for example, to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40325" name="Barry Sheerman">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)</phrase>, who has done a great deal of work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/15">We should be building bridges in education, not burning them. We should be offering young people, as we offer others, every opportunity to show that they can deploy a variety of skills, not putting them into blocks on the line or forcing them into second-class status. I yield to no one in pursuing academic excellence, seeing the strengths of traditional education, stretching young people and not soft-landing them, but we want an education system that combines the best of traditional strengths with an understanding of how we need to relate to a modern world of green skills and a low carbon economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.6/16">We should be raising young people up, not putting them down. If we do not do so, not only will they and their families be harmed, but our economy and our ability to compete will be maimed and morphed into a grotesque Hogwart&#8217;s parody of education, for which this Secretary of State would bear a solemn responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.203.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is welcome to the Chamber. We look forward to interjections from him.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.2/2">What was presumably billed, as Opposition day debates are, as a good knockabout seems to have collapsed into consensus. I am left feeling that I agree with much of what has been said from both sides of the House about the way forward in terms of rigour and a genuine consultation and re-examination of the examination system. I am left disagreeing only with the <i>Daily</i> <i> Mail,</i> a situation in which I often find myself, so it is reassuring territory for me.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.2/3">If we are to consider the key points of the debate, we should look at what was floated in that esteemed publication as a bid to end the GCSE and restore the O-level and a qualification equivalent to the CSE. It is a little like those debates about selection, in which one hears a lot about grammar schools but not so much about secondary moderns. That is not to say that there are not excellent schools out there which are now no doubt called comprehensives or academies, but which once upon a time were known as secondary moderns. They are doing good work in areas where selection still exists, but that it not a position that my party would seek to push forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.2/4">I was delighted to hear the Secretary of State at the Dispatch Box talking about a thorough examination of the GCSE, what it is, what it offers, how testing it is of young people, and its ability to stretch young people at all levels of ability, so that we celebrate the fact that not everyone will get an A*, and for those who were at one time predicted to get an F in some subject but who manage to get a D, that is a real success for them.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.0/1">We are raising the participation age by looking to use the extra years up to 17 and 18 to deliver a basic and rigorous standard. The most successful state school in the country, which I think is Lawrence Sheriff school in Rugby, uses a three-year course for its GCSEs and gets a tremendously high level of success. Perhaps it would be helpful to find out more about how education can be structured so that children can keep on learning until they get to that very high standard.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.1/1">The Chairman of the Select Committee said that he had to rewrite his speech. He has clearly been doing that and has made an additional contribution to the debate. I welcome his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/2">The debate is about how we can ensure that all young people are stretched by the system&#8212;that they are driven forward, that they are inspired and that they can aspire to reach the very best. That is what teachers, head teachers and their parents want for them. It is clear that there has been grade inflation, a topic that has been covered by several right hon. and hon. Members. People are perhaps being given the impression that there is an endless arc upon which we will see results improve. We had a brief discussion about the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s progress at the Rio summit and the issues there of exponential growth without due consideration being given to sustainability. Perhaps what we are talking about in this debate is sustainability in the examination system.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/3">When the Secretary of State came to the Dispatch Box last week to respond to an urgent question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase>, we had a slightly more <i>Daily Mail</i>-influenced discussion across the House, as the news was hot off the press. The Secretary of State at that point was clearly responding to the leak, from wherever it came, and was not able to present a more thorough position, as he has done today. He ruled out the idea of returning to the 1950s with the O-level and the CSE, and instead proposed re-examining the GCSE and moving forward. I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/4">The proposal relating to examination boards seems to be moving forward to consultation. I can see the strengths of a system in which a board concentrates on a particular subject area. There are those of us who might be surprised not to see the Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/5">looking at a more market-based solution. The proposal could be said to be a little centrally directed, but as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40642" name="Tessa Munt">the Member for Wells (Tessa Munt)</phrase> pointed out, young people are increasingly moving with their families to other parts of the country. If they join a school or college part-way through a course where the syllabus is different from their previous course, that presents problems. There have been one or two examples where the head teacher of an academy, who is responsible for admissions, has said that they are not able to take a young person on a course offered at their institution because the syllabus is different. Perhaps progress could be made in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/6">These issues would need close examination to ensure that a range of courses was available so that all young people are inspired by what is on offer. There must be no sad homogenisation, and teachers must have the scope to ensure that they cover a broad curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/7">We have an opportunity to look closely at the issue of rigour. I am delighted that we are not moving towards a wholesale change of the system, which could prove to be a distraction. As a Government the coalition has rightly moved to lift burdens on teachers and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy. Teachers want from us the support to use the skills that they have acquired. The Secretary of State was absolutely right to point out that we have a fantastic generation of teachers out there inspiring and working with young people. They do not want another upheaval and change; they want the confidence to know that the examinations to which they are submitting their students will be correct, robust and a fair assessment of those young people&#8217;s attainment, and, in some senses, of the attainment of the school or college in supporting those young people to the best of their potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.1/8">I am delighted to say that the motion hangs on the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, unlike the shadow Minister, who sadly is not hanging on the words that I am offering to the Chamber. He clearly was hanging on the words of the Deputy Prime Minister last week, and it is good to see that the Opposition take such close account of what he has to say, as they did earlier this afternoon. The motion talks about a Government proposal to do certain things, which, as has become clear, the Government are not proposing to do. Therefore, it would be entirely the wrong thing to support a motion based on such a false premise. On the other hand, we have an amendment, around which I hope the House can coalesce, which talks about rigour and the need to ensure that there is a broad-based curriculum focused on the key areas of study and encouraging all young people to aspire to the best of their potential, and tackling social mobility, as the coalition agreement and the Government have set out to do, to ensure that all young people, no matter where they start out, are given every opportunity to achieve the very best for them and for their communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.206.1/1">It was amazing how they were all ready, almost whipped in, but perhaps the Secretary of State will have another visit to the High Court and his friend Judge Leveson to explain all this.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.1/2">The Secretary of State will know that I have no problem with some of his policies. I am happy to support the English baccalaureate, much greater rigour in standards, and the ending of endless repeat examinations and an end to semi-vocational, grade-inflating GCSE-equivalent exams. However, I share with my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State serious reservations about the downgrading of the engineering diploma, at a time when we are interested in rebalancing the British economy. I am in favour of schools being allowed to conduct internal streaming, of academy schools in the right circumstances, of apprenticeships when done properly. As an historian, I am also in favour of pupils learning dates and poems, because that provides the structure and the architecture that allows for greater learning and understanding. I am in favour of the Wolf report and what it means for skills training.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.1/3">A large part of the agenda I can concur with, but this bizarre decision to think about abolishing GCSEs and reintroduce O-levels and CSEs strikes me as deeply misguided. How would this help children in my constituency of Stoke-on-Trent? I want students in my city to take GCSEs in relevant subjects, to be taught well and to aspire. I do not think that at the age of 14 they should be hived off into CSEs; for their aspirations to be put into a straitjacket. As the Chair of the Select Committee said, we know the problems about standards, but no Government Member has been able to stand up and say, &#8220;Yes, the solution to this problem is, as reported in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the O-level/CSE divide.&#8221; Until we hear that, this is, as the Chair also said, a slightly bizarre debate. But I will continue working on the dangerous assumption of <i>Daily Mail</i> correctitude.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.1/4">Looking at the <i>Financial Times </i>research, 25% of children in my constituency would be put into the straitjacket of CSEs. That is not the soft bigotry of low expectations, but the hard bigotry of low expectations in action. It demonstrates a total poverty of ambition.</p>

	<p pid="c.207.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. That is why I found the discussion about employers knowing the difference between a C at GCSE at different levels attained wholly fallacious. If the big problem of educational attainment is the long tail of under-achievement, the measures to combat that need to be there for all. There is no evidence to suggest that dividing at 14 will help that. We had an interesting contribution today on some of the neurological evidence of the potential for growth from 14 to 16. What we do have evidence for is how overwhelming it will be for the poor and those from socio-economically challenged backgrounds who will be condemned to the new CSEs. That is why the 1980s Conservative Government abandoned this policy. In 1985, Sir Keith Joseph, who became Lord Joseph, unveiled evidence that there is</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/2">&#8220;strong association between low achievement and the poverty-related factors of poor housing, single-parent families and a low proportion of children in higher socio-economic groups&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/3">This policy of division was too divisive even for Sir Keith.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/4">We also hear that with the new O-levels there will be no national curriculum&#8212;although a back-door one because of a single qualification authority. This strikes me as a rather strange route to developing the kind of curriculum we want, drawing on a wide knowledge base. It also flies in the face of the Secretary of State&#8217;s ambitions to create a national narrative of British history, to teach in all our schools a single notion of British history that imbues notions of citizenship which develops a&#8212;rather Whiggish in my view&#8212;conception of the British past that all will share. They will not all share that if there is no national curriculum. The greater the division between schools, the greater the division in the teaching of history. Any ambition to teach a cohesive notion of citizenship through the teaching of history is totally undone by the elimination of a cohesive national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/5">Internal reforms of the GCSE would be welcome. Clampdown on grade inflation and the proposals vis-&#224;-vis the examinations board are to be welcomed. An end to generalised humanities GCSEs&#8212;the merging of history and geography&#8212;are to be welcomed. We can learn from the international GCSE, the I-bac. But all that can be achieved within the current system. That is the tragedy of what the Secretary of State is up to.</p>

	<p pid="c.207.2/1">The hon. Gentleman mentions the baccalaureate and international GCSEs. If those are acceptable, and it seems that they are, and they are the examinations for able pupils, which they are, what would happen to the other GCSEs that would be occupied by the less able?</p>

	<p pid="c.207.3/1">The point about the GCSE is that it is a general certificate of secondary education. The point about the CSE is that it had stigma attached to it. At GCSE one can have an A and an A*. There is still the GCSE and a structure. The briefing to the <i>Daily Mail</i> is</p>
	<p pid="c.207.3/2">that there is an ambition to return to a more divisive system. The tragedy is that there is so much work to be done: the quality of teacher training; ending the scandal of an ever-expanding key stage 4, which means pupils are finishing history or geography in year 8; ending the relentless examination culture that sees AS exams in the January of the lower sixth&#8212;we need to get rid of that; embedding a new strategy for the teaching of foreign languages; driving up numeracy and literacy. These are the real challenges confronting schooling. In the face of these challenges, this political strategy seems a massive misallocation of the Secretary of State&#8217;s time and resources and those of civil servants in his Department. The Government are already reviewing the primary and secondary school curricula, so why also begin this tub-thumping policy that is not based on empirical evidence?</p>
	<p pid="c.207.3/3">This is no way to make policy: revealing these kinds of ideas in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, a newspaper usually opposed to deep thinking, learning and cohesive policy development, and at a time when young people are taking their exams. All we can hope is that it is a rather cack-handed example of kite-flying by a Secretary of State who is slightly puffed up at the moment and that the kite will soon be shot down and normal service resumed.</p>

	<p pid="c.208.0/1">This has been a confectionary debate featuring a number of individual sweets, not least the polo mint that constitutes the motion. I have studied it in great detail and found nothing that takes forward this country&#8217;s education debate. In the words of one coalition colleague, it is an &#8220;opportunistic wheeze.&#8221; Having studied the motion and found nothing of substance, we should then go back to the words of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon.

	<p pid="c.208.2/1">No. I can assure hon. Members that it is the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s proposals that are lighter than air; I have studied them and found that there is not much in them.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/2">We then move on to the Celebrations moment. While I was in hospital last year, when something took place that was of good order I would be provided with a large box of Celebrations. There was such a time earlier today: the shadow Secretary of State, like St Paul on the road to Damascus, stood forth and admitted for the first time that there had been grade inflation under Labour. However, despite repeated questioning by me and others, he refused to state when he first discovered this grade inflation. Was it 1997, 2005, 2010, 2012, or was it yesterday? He failed to divulge when that magical</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/3">event took place. That is a crucial point, because the discovery of grade inflation is utterly important to an assessment of how this policy is going forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/4">Despite throwing money at the problem, the previous Government did not see the results. As other Members have outlined, maths, literacy and science all declined, whatever type of test was taken. Academies do work, and I applaud the expansion of that programme. Let us take as an exemplar the words of Andrew Adonis, the former Schools Minister, who said there should be &#8220;strong independent governance&#8221; that was &#8220;free of local authority red tape&#8221;, with exemplary leadership and &#8220;brilliant teachers&#8221; who were specially chosen. That is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/5">In Northumberland, part of which I represent, schools saw little of the financial benefit that the previous Government bestowed on individual local authorities. The situation has changed, I am pleased to say, with the rebuild announcement for Prudhoe community high school, and I look forward to welcoming the Secretary of State when he visits Northumberland shortly. I will also be showing him the amazing Queen Elizabeth high school in Hexham, another school that was denied any sort of funding or rebuild under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/6">However, I have two reservations that I want to raise with the Minister. First, we should be wary of change for change&#8217;s sake. Every teacher in Northumberland I spoke with before the last election explained with growing depression how every year there was a different syllabus, a different amendment or a different set of textbooks, all costing huge amounts of money, in circumstances in which some consistency was clearly needed so that they could get on with what they wanted to do, which was to teach.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/7">Secondly, I wish to echo some of the comments that have been made on vocational education. I am not a fan of nail technology being a GCSE. However, I represent a constituency in rural Northumberland where we value vocational education very highly. I suggest that the lesson the Minister should take forward is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is absolutely vital that we hang on to the engineering and alternative qualifications. I totally understand and applaud the desire to reduce the number of vocational qualifications, but there is a danger of being excessive in that policy, and in rural areas in particular that will affect the quality of education provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.2/8">Given the time limit and the number of Members who wish to speak, I will bring my remarks to a close. I suggest that in these circumstances there is a great deal of scope. I support what the Government are doing and think that the motion has absolutely no merit whatsoever.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.2/1">Young people are our future, yet the value some people place on them and their achievements is extremely low. I feel</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/2">that many members of the current Government must be trying to secure some kind of medal, in this Olympic year, for driving the value of our young people and their achievements to a record low. Time and again they send young people negative messages, undervalue their hard work in sitting their examinations and then, when they do well, put the boot in again by suggesting that their certificates are hardly worth the paper they are printed on.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/3">The Secretary of State wants to drive up standards&#8212;we all do&#8212;but the actions he now proposes will effectively write off a large number of young people who need the greatest support and lower their expectations for a happy and productive life. Does he really believe that that is the way forward, or are his latest pronouncements about something else? Is he using our children and their education to create a debate in the Tory section of the Government, where attitudes are very different from those of their coalition partners? Is he just playing controversial games with our children&#8217;s future, as the newspapers suggest, as he aims to take over from a weak Prime Minister who is struggling to harness his partners and achieve the right-wing agenda he thought he would be pursuing after the general election?</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/4">The former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, axed the two-tier O-level/CSE system. She, like the president of the Liberal Democrats, recognised that it was divisive and dumped millions of young people into a second division from which they could not escape. I never thought that I could agree with such people on anything, but on this I cannot help agreeing with them both. I never thought that a son of Thatcher&#8212;perhaps a grandson&#8212;could be the one to turn against her in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/5">The Secretary of State has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/6">&#8220;The coalition Government&#8217;s education reforms are designed to raise standards in all our schools and give every child the opportunity to acquire the rigorous qualifications that will enable them to succeed in further and higher education and the world of work.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-06-21.1025"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 June 2012; Vol. 546, c. 1025</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/7">However, I, along with the vast majority of educational professionals, can see the opposite happening. Rather than reducing educational inequality, the reforms that those in the Tory part of the coalition propose will do the opposite. Under the new proposals, around three quarters of pupils could sit tough tests modelled on the old O-level while the remaining pupils take more straightforward qualifications modelled on traditional CSEs in subjects such as maths, English and science. But separating 75% of pupils from the other 25% will do nothing but divide children into winners and losers at the incredibly young age of 14, capping aspiration and putting up a barrier to social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/8">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40451" name="Pat Glass">the Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)</phrase>, I am a member of the Education Committee and visited Singapore earlier this year. Some children there go into the elite education programme at age 12 while the others are shoved down the technical route. We visited both types of schools and found that the facilities were very good. However, I was extremely saddened to hear young people talk of themselves as the elite. They are encouraged to talk themselves up, which is good, but what about the young people who are not the elite? If the Education Secretary wants to replicate Singapore&#8217;s system here, what would that contribute to equality of opportunity?</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/9">This is not just a moral argument against segregating pupils; it is also an argument based on strong evidence. Relegating 14-year-olds to a lesser qualification brands them as underachievers and could drain both students and schools of any incentive to push for higher performance. If we move on to the CSE track a child who would otherwise be aiming for a C at GCSE, we may find that they are very likely to stop trying and not to value the qualification that they finally achieve. One third of children who score in the bottom 25% at 11 years old break out of that group by 16, but if they are placed in a second-class category at an early age they risk being written off. Quite simply, schools cannot predict with 100% accuracy the future of their pupils, and many will struggle to place children correctly.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/10">Once again, the north-east of England will bear the brunt of the Government&#8217;s changes, as research shows that the CSE will be most prevalent in northern towns. That the Secretary of State is intent on limiting the ambitions and opportunities for people in my constituency and many others throughout our region is shameful.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.2/11">While in office, Labour managed to narrow the educational gap between the rich and the poor, not through dumbing down, as Government Members like to believe, but through more investment in schools and teachers and through giving schools more freedom to innovate. Even the Secretary of State recognises that we have the best cohort of teachers ever, but that did not happen by accident. It was investment in their training, and excellent support in the classroom, that helped them to raise their game and to support our children as never before. That is what makes a real difference to our children&#8217;s education, not imposing outdated ideas that have already been shown to fail.</p>

	<p pid="c.211.0/1">This has been an historic debate, because for the first time the Front-Bench spokesmen on both sides of the House have acknowledged clearly and unequivocally a truth that has been obvious for a long time: our exam system, over a number of years, has been dumbed down. I give great credit to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> for saying that clearly and unequivocally in response to my question.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/2">I was in the first year group to sit GCSE exams. My class did one O-level in January and eight or nine GCSEs in June. In the O-level, three of the class of 27 got an A grade; in every GCSE subject, a majority got A grades; and in some, almost every member of the class did. It was clear when GCSEs were introduced that it was easier to get top grades in them than in O-levels, and research by the university of Durham and feedback from employers and parents shows that there has been a further deterioration since then.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/3">The Secretary of State has already done a lot to try to address the problem in respect of the English baccalaureate, ending the modular system, re-sits, an emphasis on spelling, punctuation and grammar and by getting rid of some equivalents, but further measures are needed. It is good that there seems to be consensus on a single exam board and on ending the race to the bottom, so I shall focus on the main issue in the debate, the fear of a two-tier system, and say clearly and unequivocally that I do not want to go back to a CSE system.</p>

	<p pid="c.212.1/1">I will not take interventions, for reasons of time.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/2">I do not want to go back to a CSE system, but we need the radical reform of our GCSEs in order to bring back a degree of academic rigour. The Education Committee Chairman made a very important point to the Secretary of the State about how raising the threshold will raise the number of people who succeed. I believe passionately, as a parent and from my experience of visiting schools, that paradoxically if we raise the threshold we will find that young people respond to it. That is the experience of schools that have switched to the IGCSE exam.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/3">In the briefing pack for this debate, I saw some research from King&#8217;s college, London, showing the decline in maths over the past 30 years, with many 14-year-olds not understanding concepts such as algebra and ratios. I am not satisfied that my nine-year-old is stretched at his primary school, so I work with him on his maths at home, and he has already grasped those topics. I do not think that he is especially bright or clever, but I passionately believe that our young people are full of talent, and if they are pushed and stretched they will respond.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/4">We also need to acknowledge that at 16 years old the right outcome for all our young people is not necessarily to sit a full suite of academic qualifications. For years and years this country has lacked a proper, respected vocational alternative, but if we secure such an alternative, we should not deride it as part of a two-tier system in which people doing vocational qualifications are somehow failures or second best.</p>

But we should recognise that it is not the right outcome for all young people, so there should be a proper vocational alternative, and we should not regard the young people who go down that route as failures or as second best in any way. I believe that absolutely passionately.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.3/2">I shall end my speech&#8212;I know others want to speak&#8212;with one final point. Changing our exam system is not in and of itself a solution to the problems that the Education Committee Chairman has identified, but it is part of the mix, alongside the other things that the Government are doing: getting the basics right in primary school so that everybody learns to read and can access the curriculum that follows; emphasising discipline so that young people can actually learn in the classroom; giving teachers the freedom to innovate within their schools; giving parents a proper and effective choice through the free school model; and, finally, setting a floor and saying to schools that do not live up to the minimum standards that we have a right to expect, &#8220;That&#8217;s not good enough. We&#8217;re going to bring in an academy to replace you.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.212.3/3">That package of measures, together with a robust exam system, is what we need to give this country what it needs&#8212;the best equipped young people in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.3/4">That is the only way to get the companies that will give us the jobs we want to locate themselves here, so we need to have the courage to bite the bullet and say openly, as both Front Benchers have for the first time today, that we have dumbed down our system over a number of years&#8212;not just under the previous, Labour Government; it has been going on for a long time&#8212;and that that process needs to be reversed. We need to bring back rigour, to provide a proper vocational alternative and to stop the sterile argument about a two-tier system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.213.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" speakername="Nicholas Dakin" colnum="213"  time="018:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0002.htm#120626107000042">
	<p pid="c.213.0/1">Having a good look at our examination system is a valid thing to do. Indeed, the Chair of the Education Committee has reminded us that next Tuesday it will publish its report into the matter, and I know from my time serving on the Committee that it will have fully interrogated the issues and will produce a robust report to drive forward policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/2">Such a principled, considered approach contrasts with the Secretary of State&#8217;s way of doing business&#8212;by hunch, lunch and leak. Indeed, after sitting through 40 minutes of his speech today, I was still no clearer at the end about his proposals. It was a content vacuum, I am afraid, but things need addressing. Are there plans to scrap the national curriculum at 14 years old, and would that allow schools and colleges greater flexibility to offer a more skills-based curriculum to those young people who prefer a more practical, vocational approach? Will the millions of pounds&#8212;a sum that has doubled in the past 10 years&#8212;being spent on examinations be reduced?</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/3">At the heart of the Secretary of State&#8217;s leak to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, there seemed to be a half-baked idea about some back to the future, imaginary utopia, enshrined in a return to O-levels and CSEs. I fear that that has far more to do with clever politicking than with intelligent policy making, however, and that the Secretary of State is keen to deliver soundbites for the Tory tabloids rather than sound policies for the young people of today and UK plc.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/4">It is all a bit like a Monty Python sketch in which someone says, &#8220;Exams were much harder in my day. I had to recite poems and parse sentences.&#8221; The reply would be, &#8220;Recite poems and parse sentences? You were lucky. I had to recite the complete works of Shakespeare and then write an essay on a day in the life of a pound note.&#8221; Seriously, however, people like to believe that things were harder in the past, although the evidence is far from clear, and the Secretary of State is tapping into a populist instinct: nostalgia politics.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/5">One of the few things I know a bit about is preparing young people for exams. I have prepared them for a range of exams: CEEs, CSEs, O-levels, A-levels, S-levels, AS-levels, BTECs. You name it, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have prepared young people for it, but in terms of setting and assessing standards, the worst exam that I ever prepared people for was O-level English, which was a total lottery, so if the Secretary of State thinks that going back to something like that will improve standards, he really is on another planet: planet dogma, or planet not in this place.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/6">When Sir Keith Joseph was introducing the changes, he made very clearly the case for their necessity, stating that</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/7">&#8220;the system we propose will be tougher but clearer and fairer&#8230;it will be more intelligible to users&#8230;better than O-levels&#8230;and better than CSE&#8230;it will stretch the able more; and&#8230;stretch the average more.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1984-06-20.306"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 June 1984; Vol. 62, c. 306</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/8">I believe, from my professional experience, that that is what the GCSE has done. That does not mean it is perfect, or that it does not need improving, but any idea about going back to the 1950s, and to exam systems that may or may not have been appropriate for that time, is unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/9">It is worth noting, however, that the debate about an exam at 16 years old is actually rather odd and anachronistic, because, with the raising of the participation age, the qualification that young people leave with at 18 years old is what really matters. Focusing so much attention on what happens at 16 misses the point, because with rising participation levels, the main thing is the skills, attributes and experiences that young people leave school with at 18 to allow them, one hopes, into a world of work.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/10">One of the big problems regarding aspiration for young people is the fact that young people&#8217;s unemployment is at a record high on this Government&#8217;s watch. That has a genuine impact on aspiration in classrooms. I am afraid that despite the skills, expertise and professionalism of those great teachers, led by great head teachers, up and down the land, that remains the context in which they are working. As people providing policy and governance, one of our gifts should be to produce a mechanism to enable young people to move into employment and ensure that they have the proper skills, attributes and aptitudes to do well in it.</p>

	<p pid="c.214.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase> that this has been a historic debate. There has been a tendency for people in this country to live in a fantasy land. We think that as long as we allow grades to go up and tell ourselves it is okay, it is okay, but in an era of globalisation it is not enough to tell ourselves that everything is okay; it really has to be so. We have been doing this in relation to grade inflation and what we have been telling our young people. We have been saying, &#8220;Do this nice course&#8212;it&#8217;s all going to be fine and no one is going to tell you that you&#8217;ve done badly&#8221;, but reality has to hit them at some point, and that happens when they go out into the world of work and find that the cosy story they have been told behind their school gates does not match up to the reality outside. What the Secretary of State has said is therefore massively important. I am extremely pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> has acknowledged that grade inflation has been taking place.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.0/2">I would like the House to acknowledge that we have seen the creation of a two-tier system by stealth. Any two-tier system is bad, and this one has IGCSEs and the international baccalaureate for the well-off and the sharp-elbowed, with the less sharp-elbowed left with GCSEs, or their equivalents, that will not get them a job at the end of the day. That is absolutely appalling. No one can defend the status quo, and anyone who tries to</p>
	<p pid="c.214.0/3">do so has a much lower opinion of the country&#8217;s children than I do. I want to concentrate on a premise that underlies a lot of the debate about this two-tier system. Of course, every child must have the opportunity, and must be pushed, to do the best they can at core academic subjects; I am a great supporter of the E-bac in that respect. However, to suggest that unless a child does those core subjects they are thrown on to the scrap heap, as Labour Members have repeatedly have done, betrays an extraordinary attitude towards so-called vocational education.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.0/4">Again, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central. If we did not have people who did not find grammar and algebra books the most interesting thing in the world, we would not be standing in a building that is so intricately and beautifully built, with incredible craftsmanship. I object to the term &#8220;vocational&#8221;, which has arisen in the past decade or so, because it is a euphemism that betrays a slight embarrassment about the kinds of skills that have made our cities and our country great, and a reluctance actually to name practical, manual and technical skills, crafts and tradesmanship. In future, I should like the term &#8220;vocational&#8221; to be abolished and replaced with something far more honest. In terms of equivalence, we have been doing nothing for tradesmanship, craftsmanship and so-called vocational trades and everything for academic qualifications. Nail technology is not studied to get a job, because there are not enough nail technology jobs to go round for all the hundreds of thousands of people who are doing these courses. It has been all about the exam results, not the jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.0/5">There has been an overwhelming need to get real, and the Secretary of State&#8217;s bravery in tackling the underlying problems in our GCSE system is a welcome attempt to do so. I hoped for a moment that Labour Members had got real, but it seems that they may not have done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" speakername="Nia Griffith" colnum="215"  time="018:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0002.htm#120626107000044">
	<p pid="c.215.0/1">I am certainly not against change. As a former teacher, examiner and Ofsted inspector, I spent a lifetime trying to raise standards of teaching and learning and to develop programmes of study that better prepared pupils for the modern world so that, for example, in foreign languages we moved on from talking about boys falling out of cherry trees to teaching children realistic phrases that they could use in business and leisure situations.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/2">Did I detect the Secretary of State retreating from the position attributed to him in the press last week? Did he really say that he was not going for a CSE/O-level divide? I am not sure. I remember, though, that back in 1981, well before the GCSE was rolled out nationwide, I was piloting the 16-plus. That is because we believed very much in piloting things to see how they worked out and what the problems were. We were trying to put together two very different examinations, with a D grade being attributed to pupils of average ability. That is how we got to the system whereby the A to C grade was seen as the superior way of designating some children, with D to G grades for the rest, and with the foundation and higher papers. I make no apology for that; it is the history of how it came about. It is extremely difficult to set questions that will stretch a very able pupil but not prove to be complete gobbledegook, and a complete deterrent, to the very least able, and that was the point</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/3">of having different papers. The key thing was that right up until March or April, pupils could move between the examinations that they were going to take in June. That was very important because it gave everyone an incentive to keep working the whole time and not to think, &#8220;Oh well, they&#8217;re only CSEs, so I don&#8217;t need to work so hard.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/4">I have serious worries about the introduction of a dual system. For example, in small subject areas such as music or a second foreign language, children of a larger range of ability are often taught in the same class. Will they now have to be taught two different syllabuses, or programmes of study, because one class will include the more able and the less able, with some going in for a CSE and some going in for an O-level? In smaller schools, that will affect not only small subjects but mainstream subjects. It may be very difficult to accommodate everybody. The teacher might have to run about trying to cope with two programmes of study at once, or perhaps some pupils will be discouraged from taking the subject having been told that they can do it only if they are capable of doing the O-level-type examination.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/5">Dual entry could arise, because a child who might fail the more difficult O-level-equivalent exam would therefore do the CSE as well. A lot of money is already spent on examination fees, and dual entry is extremely expensive. As well as creating additional costs, it would place a lot of extra pressure on children and staff. There is a danger that children will suddenly not be given a chance to do the more difficult exam and be withdrawn because they might mess up the results. There would be the sheer disruption of introducing two completely new examination systems when there are many simpler and more effective ways of raising standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/6">I do not understand the Secretary of State saying that people in this country do not re-sit English and maths, because they certainly do. When we go to any institution for 16 to 18-year-olds, we will find people making sure that they give every pupil the chance to get the A to C grades in English and maths that are so essential to their going on to their future careers or university courses. On international comparisons, it is not at the top end of the ability range that we do so badly in this country, but at the middle and lower ends. Creating segregated systems will do nothing to improve the morale of the middle-ability and less able pupil; in fact, it will do precisely the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.0/7">As regards examination boards, the Secretary of State alleged that there had been some shopping around to find the system that provided the highest grades for the least effort. It is true that there has been some choosing of different programmes of study, perhaps because some are more inspiring or user-friendly to the pupil. I am not against having more than one examination board, but will the Secretary of State please confirm that we are not going to have separate examination boards for different subjects, which would be an examination officer&#8217;s nightmare? I also plead with him to allow some space for innovation. Having different examination boards has allowed us to innovate without a 100% roll-out.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.0/1">We have had a fascinating debate, with contributions from 13 hon. Members: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40451" name="Pat Glass">the Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)</phrase>, the hon. Member for Beverley and</p>

Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase>. It has been an interesting, although not entirely illuminating, debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/3">The Opposition have no disagreement with the case that there is a need to reform the GCSE. As the House knows, the GCSE was first sat by pupils 25 years ago. I was teaching at the time. The idea that the world has not changed sufficiently since then for the GCSE to require reform is as ludicrous as the idea that the world is sufficiently similar to how it was 50 years ago that we have to return to O-levels and CSEs. The raising of the education and training leaving age to 18 raises the fundamental question of what public examinations we need at 16 and what they are for. That is a legitimate debate. One hon. Member asked whether we need to spend the huge amount of money that we spend on examinations at the age of 16. We have to ensure that GCSEs are fit for purpose, but we do not need to go back to the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/4">In the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, we do not need to recreate</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/5">&#8220;a two tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrap heap&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/6">The more observant hon. Members will have noticed that we included those words in our motion. However, the Government amendment, which is signed, among others, by the Deputy Prime Minister, would expunge those words from the motion. That is a novel approach. It might well be first time that a senior Cabinet Minister has tabled an amendment to delete his own words.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.0/1">There would be a problem if the Deputy Prime Minister had said something in the amendment that disagreed with what he said before. The amendment has a different emphasis, but there is no contradiction between the two.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.217.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148" speakername="Kevin Brennan" colnum="217"  time="018:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0002.htm#120626125001232">
	<p pid="c.217.1/1">In that case, the Deputy Prime Minister could have left his own words in the amendment that he signed, but he chose to delete them. I am tempted to say, in the words of the late, great Amy Winehouse, &#8220;What kind of Lib-Demery is this?&#8221; Let us allow for a moment the notion that the Deputy Prime Minister meant what he said about a two-tier system, despite trying to delete his own words from the motion.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/2">The Government amendment appears to contradict the leaks from the Secretary of State&#8217;s advisers last week that he would not need parliamentary approval or Lib Dem support for his proposal to bring back CSEs and O-levels. We have it from the <i>Financial Times</i> that Downing street now insists that the Secretary of State cannot go ahead without approval with the proposals that he leaked to the <i>Daily Mail</i> last week. The <i>Financial Times</i> article goes on to say that</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/3">&#8220;the idea of a lower qualification for less academic children&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/4">is &#8220;dead in the water.&#8221; Perhaps when he responds, the Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase> will confirm whether that idea is dead in the water. If it is, why are the Secretary of State&#8217;s advisers at this moment spinning to the press lobby in the House of Commons that a lower qualification known as an N-level will be introduced&#8212;something that he did not announce to the House?</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/5">The Minister needs to come clean when he winds up. Is the two-tier plan that was leaked to the <i>Daily Mail</i> by the Secretary of State&#8217;s closest advisers dead in the water or not? Is it full steam ahead for the Secretary of State, or is this a humiliating climbdown? The Secretary of State was asked on three occasions&#8212;or as he would say, thrice&#8212;whether the <i>Daily Mail</i> report was wrong, and thrice he demurred and did not tell us. If he is making a humiliating climbdown, he must apologise to all his friends who came out in support of the proposals in the media.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/6">The manner and timing of the leak to the <i>Daily Mail</i> were a disgrace, at a time when students up and down the country, who have been working hard for months on end, were sitting their GCSEs. What a contrast that is to the way in which the GCSE was introduced all those years ago. A debate was kicked off in 1976 by Jim Callaghan, the former Labour Prime Minister. It was developed by Shirley Williams, although she has gone off the tracks a little since then. Come to think of it, we have not heard much from her on this subject. It would be interesting to know what she thinks. The idea was picked up by Keith Joseph&#8212;that well known lily-livered, liberal, loony lefty&#8212;and implemented by Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s Education Secretary, Kenneth Baker, following thorough debate and consideration. It was welcomed across the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/7">In contrast, we now have a proposal to rip up the GCSE, with accompanying disparaging rhetoric, cooked up by a cabal, no doubt using private e-mail accounts, with no reference to the Department&#8217;s officials or to other Departments, and kept secret even from one of the Secretary of State&#8217;s Education Ministers. What a ludicrous way to run a Department that is, and how symptomatic of the Secretary of State&#8217;s seething lack of trust in his own Minister and officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/8">At least we can assume that the Secretary of State would be kinder to and have more faith in those on his own side. Not so, because we now find out that not even the Prime Minister knew the details of what he was about to leak to the <i>Daily Mail</i>. A Downing street spokesman told the <i>Financial Times</i>:</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/9">&#8220;It looks as if we&#8217;re being bounced into something we weren&#8217;t prepared for.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/10">What about the Education Committee, which is chaired ably by the Secretary of State&#8217;s Conservative colleague, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, who as always made a thoughtful contribution today? Let us be clear that the Chair of the Select Committee is no fan of Labour education policy. We have had many discussions about it and, to save him any embarrassment, I confirm that he is no fan of Labour education policy. Nevertheless, we respect his long-standing commitment to raising the standards for those at the bottom. As the Secretary of State well knows, the Committee is at this moment undertaking a review of qualifications and examinations that seeks to address some of these questions. What contempt the Secretary of State has shown for the</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/11">Education Committee by publicising his plans in the press without any consideration of the Committee&#8217;s work. I took a sharp intake of breath when the Secretary of State said to the Chair of the Select Committee in the debate, &#8220;If the cap on aspiration fits, wear it.&#8221; That was uncalled for and was off the mark with regard to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s commitment to helping those at the lower end. However, I know that he needs no help from me.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/12">I met the CBI earlier today. Like us, it thinks that the GCSE needs to be looked at again. Like us, it thinks that a much wider debate is needed than the headline-grabbing call for a return to O-levels and CSEs that we have had from the Secretary of State. GCSEs are not, despite the impression that the Secretary of State tried to give last week, a worthless piece of paper, but that is exactly how Kenneth Baker described CSEs, which the Secretary of State last week seemed so keen to bring back. As my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe pointed out, many O-levels were not rigorous qualifications, but required little more than a Gradgrindian regurgitation of facts. Factual knowledge is not enough in a world in which, as the CBI told me today, more data will be created this year than have been created in the previous 5,000 years. Rote learning is insufficient in a world that needs citizens who can process intelligently a mass of information and data in their daily lives. We need breadth and balance in the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.1/13">The GCSE was brought in not as a single examination paper, as some Government colleagues seem to think, but as a single examinations system that would give everybody the chance to succeed if they reached the required standard. That is a principle worth preserving. Reform, yes; back to the future, no.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40123" name="Charlotte Leslie">the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)</phrase> pointed out, we need a reality check. The overarching objective of the Government&#8217;s education policy is to close the attainment gap between those from wealthier and those from poorer backgrounds, which is wider in this country than in many of our competitor nations. The gap means that 49% of pupils eligible for free school meals achieved a grade C or better in GCSE maths last year compared with 74% of all non-free school meal pupils; that 67% of pupils eligible for free school meals achieved the expected level in reading when they left primary school last year compared with 82% of non-free school meal pupils; and that just 8% of pupils eligible for free school meals were entered for the English baccalaureate combination of core academic GCSEs compared with 22% overall.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/2">That attainment gap is morally unacceptable and, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40136" name="David Ruffley">the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr Ruffley)</phrase> said, economically damaging to this country. It has all the hallmarks of the two-tier education system that hon. Members say they wish to eliminate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.219.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="219"  time="018:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0003.htm#120626125001235">
	<p pid="c.219.2/1">I will not give way because of the time.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/2">Under the previous Government and that two-tier system, a sizeable proportion of young people were persuaded to take qualifications that scored highly in</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/3">performance tables, but that turned out to have less credibility with employers than the young people had been led to believe, as so aptly pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol North West. That is why, on the recommendation of Alison Wolf, we have looked again at all vocational qualifications taught in schools to ensure that only those highly valued by employers count in performance tables. That will raise both the value and the esteem of the vocational qualifications taught in our schools, which is supported by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/4">Last year, the OECD produced its seminal report, &#8220;How do some students overcome their socio-economic background?&#8221; It states that, in Britain, only a quarter of deprived children were able to overcome their background in terms of academic achievement, compared with more than 70% in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which places Britain 39th out of 65 OECD countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/5">Addressing those inequalities lies at the heart of every radical education reform implemented, announced or mooted by the Government since May 2010, which includes: the academies and free school programmes, which bring professional autonomy and diversity to our school system and raise standards in some of the most deprived parts of the country; the focus on phonics in reading and the phonic check&#8212;we last week checked the basic reading skills of every 6-year-old in the country&#8212;which mean that no child slips through the net with their reading problems unidentified; ending the re-sit culture and modularisation in GCSEs; restoring marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar; the pupil premium, which provides significant extra school funding for pupils who are eligible for free school meals; allowing good schools to expand; raising the floor standard of underperforming primary and secondary schools; giving more power to teachers to tackle unruly behaviour; reviewing the national curriculum; publishing draft primary school programmes of study in English, maths and science; and putting greater emphasis on reading, scientific knowledge, languages, arithmetic and the essentials of grammar, spelling and punctuation.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/6">Those are the important reforms, but as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said, the evidence shows that we must go further. A few weeks ago, a CBI survey showed that nearly half of all employers were unhappy with the basic literacy skills of school and college leavers&#8212;35% expressed concern over maths. This week, King&#8217;s College London reported that teenagers&#8217; maths skills have declined over the past 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/7">The Government are clear that we need fundamental reform. We want a broad, inclusive conversation to consider how we address the concerns of employers, parents, pupils and schools. We must learn our lessons not from the past, but from the best&#8212;from countries such as Singapore, where students are required to have a proper knowledge of syntax and grammar, an understanding of the scientific laws that govern our world, and an understanding of maths, which allow them to progress down both technical and academic routes. None of that is beyond the children of this country, but we too often lack the most basic aspiration on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/8">In Singapore, the exams designed for 16-year-olds are rigorous, academic, stretching and comprehensive. They are taken by the vast majority of the population. Those exams&#8212;O-levels drawn up by examiners in this country&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/9">set a level of aspiration for every child that helps to ensure that Singapore remains a world leader in education. We want to ensure that children in this country have exactly the same opportunities as their peers in Singapore and other high-performing nations; that our pupils are as comprehensively equipped to compete in a world of international commerce; that every single child has the opportunity to succeed to their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/10">The Government&#8217;s reforms are designed to achieve a fundamental change in expectation and academic achievement. We should expect all schools to have the academic attainment of Mossbourne academy. We want our qualifications to be world class, with the expectation that all will study for them, and that the great majority will achieve them, if not by aged 16, then by 17, 18 or 19.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">The hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> made a revealing speech. I am not aware of any Education Minister from the previous Labour Government who would accept the existence of grade inflation in GCSEs. His acceptance of that and his change of view are welcome&#8212;they help to bring honesty and candour to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/12">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase>, in seeking to defend himself from accusations of fatalism, spoke of establishing a route map from point A to point B&#8212;good luck with that&#8212;and sought more detail on the Government&#8217;s proposals before the publication of our consultation document, while refusing to give the Government a glimpse of the Education Committee&#8217;s forthcoming report on qualifications, which is due out next week.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/13">I welcome the support of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase> for the single exam board proposal and wholeheartedly congratulate New College school on its transformation, and on the &#8220;yes you can, yes you will&#8221; ethos.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/14">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40227" name="Damian Hinds">the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)</phrase> raised concerns about grade inflation, early entry for GCSE, re-sits and modularisation, and rightly pointed out that today we have a clear, two-tier GCSE system, which he called a rebranded CSE and GCE system. He revised the phrase made famous by Melanie Phillips&#8212;&#8220;All must have prizes&#8221;&#8212;by saying that all must merit prizes.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/15">I welcome the support of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430" name="Dan Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> for rigour. He is right to be reassured about genuine consultation. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> falsely accused my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40283" name="Nicholas Boles">the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles)</phrase> of earning his crust, but I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s support for the English baccalaureate and for children acquiring knowledge in history and learning poems by heart. I take on board the caution of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> against change for change&#8217;s sake.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/16">The Government are accused of wanting to create a two-tier education system, but this country already has one, which we believe is letting down too many children and young people. Professor Wolf said in her important review of vocational education that English and maths are fundamental to young people&#8217;s employment and education prospects, yet less than half of all students have good GCSEs in English and maths at the end of</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/17">key stage 4. There are two tiers: those with English and maths, and those without. There are two tiers in the current structure of GCSEs&#8212;a foundation tier and a higher tier&#8212;including in English, maths and science. The highest achievable grade in ordinary circumstances in the lower tier is C. We have two tiers in the grading system, with 19% of pupils achieving grades E, F and G in GCSE Maths, and 11% of pupils achieving those grades in English.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.2/18">We need to ensure that our exams are on a par with those in the highest performing countries in the world, and that our schools are delivering the kind of education that equips and prepares all pupils to take and excel in those exams. That is what the Government mean by closing the attainment gap. I urge the House to reject the cynical motion tabled by the Opposition and to support the radical education reform agenda being delivered by this Government to ensure rigour and high expectations for all young people in this country.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.1/1">Question accordingly agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/2" class="italic">The Deputy Speaker declared the main Question, as amended, to be agreed to. (<phrase class="standing-order" code="31(2)">Standing Order No. 31(2)</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/3" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/4">That this House notes the forthcoming consultation on the secondary school qualifications and curriculum framework; welcomes the opportunity to address the weaknesses of the system introduced by the previous Administration, which undermined confidence in standards, increased inequality and led to a reduction in the take-up of core subjects such as modern languages, history, geography and the sciences; and calls for proposals which are approved by Parliament and which are based on the principles of high standards for all, greater curriculum freedom, and a qualifications and curriculum framework which supports and stretches every child and which boosts social mobility.</p>

	Defence Reform
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.231.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="231"  time="019:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0003.htm#120626125002279">
	<p pid="c.231.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House recognises the need for defence reform; notes with concern the speed and depth of redundancies and the threat to historic regiments and battalions; supports the armed forces covenant but is anxious about the implications of changes to Service pensions and allowances and the effect of these and other measures on morale; further recognises the necessity of an advanced equipment programme but is worried about capability gaps, notably carrier strike; calls on the Government to end disadvantage and discrimination against the Service community in order to strengthen the covenant; and further calls on the Government to reassess the assumptions on which the Strategic Defence and Security Review was based.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/3">Let me begin by acknowledging the courage and professionalism of our armed forces and recognising the invaluable support provided to them by their families. I know that that sentiment will be shared by all Members in the House. We ask servicemen and women to risk making the ultimate sacrifice, and to forgo many freedoms in the name of our national security. Their contribution to our safety must never be forgotten or underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/4">Opposition Members recognise that our armed forces cannot be allowed to stand still. The combination of changing threats in an increasingly uncertain world with budgetary challenges means that we must be ahead of the curve in terms of technology and the tactics that we apply. We must be bold and practical in order to create an efficient fighting force which serves the primary requirement of our national security while also ensuring that we do the right thing on behalf of our servicemen and women and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/5">The major conflicts of recent history are drawing to a close. Meanwhile, a wave of popular uprisings throughout the middle east poses new challenges, as do new technologies and threats from cyber. Global changes will alter the balance of power, risk and how resources are allocated in the modern world. That is why Opposition Members support armed forces reform. Since May 2010, we have not opposed the Government simply for opposition&#8217;s sake. National security and support for our armed forces are worth more than cheap political point-scoring, although when we believe that the Government have made an error or strayed from their pre-election pledges, we will righty criticise and scrutinise their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/6">We welcome the coalition&#8217;s commitment in 2010 to launch the security review. It built on the Green Paper published by the last Government, and our commitment in the last Parliament to undertake a defence review. Unfortunately, however, the one thing the coalition Government&#8217;s strategic defence and security review was not was strategic. The SDSR has unravelled quickly, displaying the same short-term, ad hoc and rushed decision making that is becoming characteristic of many areas of Government policy. The decisions that have been taken have left Britain with serious gaps in its defence capability. Events in the middle east last year&#8212;the Arab spring uprisings&#8212;were not foreseen, which meant the review was rendered out of date almost as soon as it had been printed. The Government were forced to use resources they had planned to scrap and bring back capability at very short notice.</p>

	<p pid="c.232.1/1">I know the hon. Gentleman takes a close interest in defence issues, but if he had read the Green Paper he would have seen that it takes a strategic look at the world. The SDSR was very rushed, and did not have the long public consultation and engagement with stakeholders that the 1998 review had. It was basically a Treasury-led review, which has resulted in some strange decisions that I shall describe later, which have affected the capability and capacity of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.232.2/1">I am simply focusing on the word &#8220;assumptions&#8221;. In the motion, the Labour party criticises the assumptions that lay behind the SDSR. My opinion is that those assumptions are absolutely fine&#8212;although I agree with the hon. Gentleman that some of the other detail was not so good. Which of the assumptions behind the SDSR does he not like?</p>

	<p pid="c.232.3/1">I would talk about the developing situation in the middle east, some of the decisions made post-SDSR in taking away maritime capability, and the whole issue of the deployability of our armed forces. All those decisions were taken within a financial straitjacket, instead of addressing questions such as where we need to deploy in the world and what our priorities are. That has overridden the security needs that are so vital and that were outlined so well in the Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.232.3/2">As a former Ministry of Defence Minister, I know only too well that the easiest ways to make the kind of in-year savings in the defence budget that are being demanded by the Treasury are to scrap capability or to make personnel cuts. However, the Government have scrapped important capabilities&#8212;Nimrod and the Harrier fleet&#8212;without any plans as to how they will be replaced. It appears that Ministers have been inflexible in their pursuit of short-term savings at the expense of our long-term security. Too often we are given the impression that the Government are presiding over decline, rather than planning for the future. The Government must reassess the security and spending assumptions on which the review was based.</p>

	<p pid="c.232.4/1">How would a Labour Government have dealt with the &#163;38 billion overhang that the Conservatives inherited from the previous Labour Government? Also, is the hon. Gentleman saying he would, in fact, spend more on defence than the current Government? He should be explicit about that, but his motion is not explicit.</p>

	<p pid="c.232.5/1">I am glad the hon. Gentleman has asked about the &#163;38 billion black hole, because it has become folklore, but the Government have not produced any evidence to justify that figure. Let me quote from an excellent Defence Committee report&#8212;which I am surprised he has not read as he is a former member of that Committee. It says:</p>
	<p pid="c.232.5/2">&#8220;We note that the MOD now state the genuine size of the gap is substantially in excess of &#163;38 billion. However, we also note the Secretary of State&#8217;s assertion that the &#8216;for the first time in a generation, the MOD will have brought its plans and budget</p>
	<p pid="c.232.5/3">broadly into balance, allowing it to plan with confidence for the delivery of the future equipment programme&#8217;. Without proper detailed figures neither statement can be verified.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.232.5/4">We should also consider the evidence given to the Committee by the then Secretary of State. He promised the Committee he would give details, but the final report states, at paragraph 205:</p>
	<p pid="c.232.5/5">&#8220;We are surprised that this assessment has not yet begun and expect to receive a timetable for this exercise in response to this Report.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.232.5/6">The &#163;38 billion figure has been bandied around ever since it was spun out of Conservative central office in the election campaign. The Government have been asked on numerous occasions to justify it, but they have not done so. They should.</p>

	<p pid="c.233.0/1">On the subject of wasting taxpayers&#8217; money, the Government said last week that almost &#163;39 million had been spent on preparing the carriers for &#8220;cats and traps&#8221; and the variant carrier aircraft, but the media says a quarter of a billion pounds have been spent. How much money does my hon. Friend think the Government have wasted?</p>

	<p pid="c.233.1/1">As with the &#163;38 billion figure, the Government are very good at not explaining their mistakes. The original figure was, I think, &#163;37 million. It then rose to &#163;39 million, but the MOD subsequently briefed that it was &#163;100 million. However, some informed sources say that it could be upwards of &#163;250 million. The Government should state how much was spent in respect of that disastrous decision, which was taken at a time when the defence budget was experiencing savage cuts. They seem to have swept this matter aside, however, as if it is not important.</p>

	<p pid="c.233.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right: &#163;38 billion is a huge amount of money. However, I should draw his attention to a note entitled:</p>
	<p pid="c.233.2/2">&#8220;Note to Ed Miliband: Defence team work update&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.233.2/3">It states that Labour needs to be</p>
	<p pid="c.233.2/4">&#8220;credible on defence spending and neutralising the &#8216;&#163;38bn&#8217; charge, which is our biggest weakness.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.233.2/5">So the Labour Defence team think that that charge is Labour&#8217;s biggest weakness.</p>

	<p pid="c.233.3/1">The Minister is making various assumptions, which is not unusual for him. That note says precisely what I am saying today, which is that we need to shoot down this erroneous myth that has been put about by this Government. If he wants more evidence on this, he should read the National Audit Office &#8220;Major Projects Report 2009&#8221;. It says of the defence budget:</p>
	<p pid="c.233.3/2">&#8220;The size of the gap is highly sensitive to the budget growth assumptions used. If the Defence budget remained constant in real terms, and using the Department&#8217;s forecast for defence inflation of 2.7 per cent, the gap would now be &#163;6 billion over the ten years. If, as is possible given the general economic position, there was no increase in the defence budget in cash terms over the same ten year period, the gap would rise to &#163;36 billion.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.233.3/3">Even the NAO did not reach the &#163;38 billion figure, therefore. I acknowledge that the figure it gives is &#163;2 billion out and this Government seem to think such sums are</p>
	<p pid="c.233.3/4">unimportant, but I have just quoted from the NAO report. That is possibly where Conservative central office first got the figure of &#163;36 billion, but there is a big difference between &#163;36 billion and &#163;38 billion. The &#163;36 billion is based on an assumption of a flat-cash budget over the next 10 years and every single item in the equipment budget being maintained, when everyone who has ever been involved in MOD matters knows that things come into the equipment budget and things fall out of the equipment budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.234.0/1">The Defence Committee was advised in one of its briefings that the projected figure of &#163;38 billion included a roll-forward of all items on wish lists&#8212;not things for which contracts had been let, but items the MOD had expressed a possible interest in purchasing for the future. This was, we were told, the equivalent of an individual becoming bankrupt because they fancied buying a Ferrari but never actually bought one.</p>

	<p pid="c.234.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. Let me quote from the evidence given to the Select Committee by the former Secretary of State. In response to a question from a Member, he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.234.1/2">&#8220;There is a huge ability to reduce a very large proportion of that. My guess is that of that &#163;38 billion we are talking of something like &#163;8 billion to &#163;9 billion, and that is a ballpark figure.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.234.1/3">During that evidence session, he gave a commitment to the Select Committee Chair that he would write giving details of how he arrived at that figure, but he did not. The Committee was still waiting for that information when the report was produced, but it did not appear. I heard one of the Government Front Benchers scoff when I said that certain things move in and out of budget, but they clearly do. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> is right: the Government racked up everything in the programme over a 10-year period and assumed that it will all be delivered. That is similar to the argument used about pension black holes, the assumption being that all the money is paid out, today. That is not the way the defence procurement budget is structured.</p>

	<p pid="c.234.2/1">The Government obviously intend to keep the myth going, and who could blame them for that? However, can my hon. Friend explain how, on two separate occasions&#8212;we should remember that this Government have only been in power for a little over two years&#8212;two separate Secretaries of State can have claimed that the &#163;38 billion gap has already gone and that the budget is now in balance? If the imbalance was as large as they alleged, how on earth have two separate Secretaries of State been able to claim within two years that the budget is in balance already?</p>

	<p pid="c.234.3/1">My right hon. Friend, like me, knows the MOD budget very well. Clearly, what the Government have done is to take out in-year capability. We should also remember the reductions in armed forces personnel&#8212;the people who are paying for some of this. My right hon. Friend is correct: the idea that such a big black hole can be filled in two years is complete nonsense. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Under-Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" name="Andrew Robathan">the right hon.

	<p pid="c.234.3/2">have been giving. All their decisions, such as slashing personnel numbers, are predicated on this &#163;38 billion black hole. Earlier last year, the previous Secretary of State stopped using that figure&#8212;for a while. Suddenly, under the new Secretary of State, it has come back. The Government have got to explain their use of it, because it is the entire raison d&#8217;&#234;tre for some of the cuts they are making.</p>

This issue was also dealt with in Bernard Gray&#8217;s report, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, the &#163;38 billion figure is based on the principle that every single piece of equipment that was planned for would actually be delivered. However, anyone who knows the defence budget knows that that is not how things work. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am sorry, but the &#163;38 billion figure is a fiction, and this Government have got to justify it, because they are using it to justify some of their most draconian cuts, not only in equipment but to the service terms and conditions of members of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.235.3/2">&#8220;The size of the gap is highly sensitive to the budget growth assumptions used. If the Defence budget remained constant in real terms, and using the Department&#8217;s forecast for defence inflation of 2.7 per cent, the gap would now be &#163;6 billion.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.235.3/3">The figure of &#163;36 billion is reached only if flat cash over 10 years is included. Ministers said that the &#163;38 billion figure is over 10 years&#8212;that is not the impression they have been giving to the media, the armed forces and the public. Instead, they have been suggesting that we somehow have to lay our hands instantly on &#163;38 billion. As my</p>

	<p pid="c.236.1/1">We were on line in that regard. One of the jobs that my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry North East gave me when he was Secretary of State&#8212;it was something of a poisoned chalice&#8212;was to draw up some reductions. Just before the general election, I had already identified some &#163;1.2 billion of savings, but some of that involved investing money in order to save it. The problem at the moment is that the Treasury want instant cash out of the budget, and the only way to do that is to slash personnel and equipment straight away. The more sensible approach that we were going to implement was a planned phase of three to five years, involving some investment and some reductions. That is in stark contrast to the Government&#8217;s approach. What is driving this process is not defence strategy but the desire of this Government and the Treasury to take 8% out of the budget in years one and two. That has led to the short-termism we are seeing now.</p>

	<p pid="c.236.3/1">Yes, because some of the programme was not committed. The former Secretary of State was asked by the Defence Committee how much of that budget was committed, and quite a large portion of it was not. One approach could be to delay projects, as this Government and the previous Government have done, or to cancel them.</p>
	<p pid="c.236.3/2">When the previous Secretary of State took office, he said that he was going to save a load of money by renegotiating contracts with various suppliers. We have yet to see a single example of his having been able to renegotiate procurement contracts and make great savings. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am sorry, but I am not going to take any lessons from the Conservatives on the carriers, given that they have wasted upwards of &#163;100 million through a decision that&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Opposition are shouting, but I do not remember either the Minister for the Armed Forces, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40431" name="Nick Harvey">the hon.

The SNP&#8217;s so-called &#8220;campaign&#8221; on this issue is a little hollow, to say the least. The SNP needs to explain exactly what the new Scottish armed forces would be if Scotland were to be independent. Would the Navy be something like fishery protection vessels? Would the Army be downgraded to some type of border force to patrol the border between Scotland and Northumberland? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman comments from a sedentary position, but the SNP claims to be supporting these regiments and the onus is on him to say exactly what the SNP is going to do if there is to be independence in Scotland, not only on regiments, but what the shape and format of the defence forces of an independent Scotland would take. I am sure that they would be a lot smaller and a lot more ineffective than what we have now. I doubt whether they would be larger, and I am not sure what their role would be and whether they would be in or out of a NATO command structure.</p>

	<p pid="c.239.0/1">That is right, but this point about an independent Scotland is not just about the regiments and the size of the armed forces; it is about all the procurement. I am sorry, but many English shipbuilders will be arguing strongly for contracts to be placed with English yards rather than Scottish yards if Scotland becomes a foreign country. We do not procure warships from foreign Governments.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/2">The Secretary of State&#8217;s statement dealt primarily with the 45% of the budget that is spent on equipment and support. There will be no 1% real-terms rise for the 55% that is spent on other areas of defence, including personnel. We are very concerned that this will result in a real-terms cut to the armed forces personnel budget, particularly given that these costs tend to rise higher than the usual rate of inflation. Not only was the announcement therefore less comprehensive than it was spun to be in the newspapers, but it would appear that the limited investment in equipment budgets is coming at the expense of investment in personnel, who are already suffering under the Government&#8217;s cuts to personnel numbers, allowances and pensions. So it is becoming clear to many that the Secretary of State has balanced the budget on the backs of our brave service men and women, and Ministers will have to offer this House the information it needs to take these claims seriously. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Whip says from a sedentary position that that is a silly thing to say, but I think I might have a little more knowledge of the intricacies of the defence budget than he has.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/3">On the capital investment side, Ministers have not factored in the costs of the proposals to withdraw British military bases from Germany. They will have a significant short-term cost, which they seem to have conveniently just ignored. I considered that idea when I was a Minister and even four years ago the price tag was some &#163;3 billion. Again, that seems to have been conveniently forgotten in this so-called new balanced budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/4">On top of all that, the Minister has failed to substantiate the figure of &#163;38 billion. I will not reiterate the points I have read out already, but I will add a third example. Mr Jon Thompson, the director of finance at the MOD, told the Public Accounts Committee that Ministers were committed to producing a report in autumn 2011 on the extent of the so-called gap in the budget. We are still waiting. That information is vital because the legitimacy of everything the Government are doing through the defence cuts is predicated on that so-called gap.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/5">I would be grateful if the Minister could answer a few questions. As the post-2015 1% rise is an &#8220;assumption&#8221;, could it be revised between now and 2015? What rate of inflation was used to calculate the 1% real terms annual increase in the equipment budget between 2010 and 2020? When will we get the National Audit Office&#8217;s assessment of the MOD budget and, more importantly, will the House have an opportunity to debate that report?</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/6">The Secretary of State also needs to factor defence inflation into his calculations. It would be interesting to know what figure he is using for the real-terms cuts to the 55% of the MOD budget that lies outside the equipment and support budget. Members might be aware of reports over the weekend, for example, that an ongoing study of British shipbuilding might result in the delay of one of the new aircraft carriers and the potential closure of Portsmouth dockyard, with a threat to some 3,000 jobs. That casts even greater doubt on the</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/7">Ministers&#8217; claim to have balanced the budget. It is hard to see how they can justify their triumph when such issues remain unresolved. The Minister&#8217;s comments on the Portsmouth report would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/8">We now hear announcements from the MOD by leak&#8212;either official or unofficial&#8212;and an interesting one is on the future of Defence Equipment and Support. The Chief of Defence Mat&#233;riel is supposed to be pushing forward the Government-owned contractor-operated model. Restructuring is important in defence procurement, as we would all agree, but there are huge questions about the impact on accountability to Parliament of privatising decisions that deal with many millions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/9">As for the carriers, the Government have sought to present themselves as economically competent and the Opposition will resist the temptation to take Ministers at their word. As was mentioned earlier, the costly, unnecessary and humiliating U-turn on the British aircraft carrier capability meant that we ended up with a policy that the Prime Minister had rubbished the year before and that millions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money have been wasted at a time when the defence budget is being cut deeply. The Government must come clean and explain in detail how much was squandered by that reckless decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/10">Britain is a proud maritime nation, but as a result of the decisions taken in the SDSR we are left with no maritime surveillance capability and with no carrier strike capability until at least 2017. Huge issues remain unaddressed. The Secretary of State has not decided how many aircraft he will purchase, just as he has deferred his decision on whether a second carrier will be operational. He stated to the House that he would be committed to &#8220;continuous carrier availability&#8221;, but that might now not be the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/11">With such a backdrop, it is not surprising that morale in our armed forces is low. Morale has been described as in freefall as a result of some of the decisions on redundancies, cuts in allowances and permanent pension reductions. The Forces Pension Society has said that it has</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/12">&#8220;never seen a government erode the morale of the Armed Forces so quickly&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/13">I hope that right hon. and hon. Members have had the opportunity to look at today&#8217;s report on housing by the Select Committee on Defence. It shows that the cuts in expenditure on improvements in forces accommodation are leading to real pressures in Army housing.</p>

Many people do not realise that although the armed forces pension scheme is non-contributory, members of the armed forces pay for it through abatement in their increases. As the Government have abandoned the Armed Forces Pay Review Body&#8217;s recommendations and our proud record on such recommendations when</p>
	<p pid="c.240.1/2">we were in office, it is time to look at how armed forces pensions are dealt with as a whole. Interestingly, when I wanted to look more closely at such issues, the Secretary of State who resisted was Lord Hutton, who is now advising the Government on pensions in general. The issue needs to be considered as a whole&#8212;not only pensions but abatement in pay, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.240.1/3">In 2010, we were committed to spending &#163;8 billion on accommodation in the next decade, &#163;3 billion of which was for improvements and upgrades. In contrast, this Government have slashed spending on housing by some &#163;41 million. I remember that when I was a Minister and when my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry North East was Secretary of State, despite our record investment in accommodation, the then Opposition were highly critical of what we were doing. Many in the armed forces will now be dismayed by their actions in government.</p>
	<p pid="c.240.1/4">It is also important to listen to the armed forces federations. Dawn McCafferty of the Royal Air Force Families Federation has commented that families felt as though the covenant had already been broken within months of its announcement because of the cuts. Until the fall in morale is acknowledged and acted on, many will question Ministers&#8217; commitment to upholding the military covenant.</p>
	<p pid="c.240.1/5">A particular concern for us is the way in which reductions in the number of armed forces personnel are taking place. Two weeks ago, the Minister ordered yet another tranche of redundancies affecting 4,100 personnel, 30% of which were compulsory. It is a great worry that we are losing not only important skills but expertise and capability that we can no longer afford to lose. The public and armed forces community are quite rightly angry that individuals who are ready to deploy to Afghanistan are being given their P45s, despite all the assurances given by the previous Secretary of State and by this one. I know from experience that if we had treated the armed forces in such a way when we were in government, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members would rightly have pilloried that decision. We feel it is only right to hold them to the same high standard that they put forward when they were in opposition, which they seem to have conveniently forgotten now they are in government.</p>
	<p pid="c.240.1/6">Many will be concerned by the rumours that are circulating about the Government&#8217;s plans to cut regiments and battalions. Our regiments embody our proud history and the national prestige of our armed forces. Many have served with distinction in the fields of Flanders, on the beaches at Normandy and, more recently, in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan. The Secretary of State&#8217;s now-trademark lack of sensitivity when dealing with this issue is understandably creating anger among many serving in the armed forces and those who have retired.</p>

They also wholesale disbanded historic regiments and invented names from &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; for new regiments, so there can be no lessons from the Opposition about the maintenance of historic and honourable regiments. Many of us wear the scars to bear witness to that.</p>

	<p pid="c.242.3/1">I will take your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not take any more interventions. On the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase>, he knows that the recommendations put forward at that time regarding structure and names were put forward by the Army.</p>
	<p pid="c.242.3/2">Any uncertainty needs to be clarified. It is almost a month since the Secretary of State told the Royal United Services Institute that some units will inevitably be lost or merged. Given that he has gone outside Parliament to light bonfires of rumours, it is not acceptable for him to throw more petrol on them by delaying. We are told that the Ministry of Defence has signed off on this issue now but that matters are being held up by Downing street for political reasons. That uncertainty is leading to a lot more rumours, which are causing more uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="c.242.3/3">In conclusion, when they were in opposition the Conservatives called for a larger Army, a larger Navy and increased investment in the armed forces. In government, their actions have been to do exactly the opposite. It is not surprising that they are losing the trust of the armed forces community and the public so quickly. We in opposition want to support strong reform on procurement and the principles of the military covenant and we want the equipment programme to be improved. Too often the Government have put austerity before security. I hope that in his response the Minister will not just answer the questions I have put forward but will also agree with the terms of the motion and the recommendations regarding the assumptions of the defence review to give those whom we ask to serve on our behalf, the confidence and certainty they deserve.</p>

Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> did&#8212;by paying tribute to the men and women of our armed forces. The job they do is difficult, dangerous and sometimes deadly, but they do it with a professionalism, commitment and courage that we have come to expect but should never take for granted. This weekend is armed forces day, which will give all of us the opportunity to pay tribute to the contribution of the entire defence community.</p>
	<p pid="c.242.4/2">The House will note that we do not have the pleasure of the company of the shadow Defence Secretary this evening. No criticism attaches to him for going on a defence visit to Australia or for staying on for a few days afterwards. No criticism attaches to him for allowing the Secretary of State to honour a commitment to host Defence Ministers from several of our allies this evening. The only criticism of the shadow Secretary of State is that he has left the poor old hon. Member for North Durham the unenviable task of trying to move this completely nonsensical motion.</p>

	<p pid="c.243.0/1">The Minister is correct that the shadow Secretary of State is in Australia&#8212;unfortunately with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the hon.

	<p pid="c.243.1/1">I am sure we all wish the family member well. I did say that no criticism attaches to the shadow Secretary for his absence and I mean that most emphatically.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.1/2">The matter before us is this nonsensical motion. It seems to say that the Opposition recognise the need to make the changes we are making, but the fact is that they ducked these changes year after year. They went for 12 years without a defence review, with pressure building up in the defence programme all the time, and there was a black hole of whatever size&#8212;we will come back to that in a minute&#8212;by the time of the strategic defence and security review. They left our armed forces overstretched, under-equipped and underfunded for the tasks they were set. That is the legacy of the Government in which the hon. Member for North Durham served. The blame for the need to remove platforms, reduce manpower and make the other reductions we have had to do sits very squarely at the previous Government&#8217;s door. They wrecked the economy, they wrecked the defence budget and they failed to make the changes necessary to prepare our armed forces for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.1/3">The hon. Member for North Durham made heavy weather of the black hole. When we began the SDSR process in the summer of 2010 we asked the officials who were presiding over it at the MOD, &#8220;What is our baseline and what is the true financial situation as we start this process?&#8221; The explanation came that if we took the manpower commitments, all the overheads and all the committed expenditure, including the contracts that had been signed for procurement and those that had been announced by the previous Government as Ministry of Defence policy, and planned to bring them on stream when the Labour party said they would be, over the 10-year period, there was a gap between all that and a &#8220;flat real&#8221; terms assumption on funding&#8212;not a &#8220;flat cash&#8221; assumption&#8212;in relation to the 2010-11 budget. We were told that the gap over the 10-year period would amount to &#163;38 billion. It was a 10-year period because that is the length of time over which the MOD plans its budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> said that that was an unreasonable thing to view as a starting point. She compared it with the situation of someone who was about to go personally bankrupt aspiring to buy a Ferrari, but I do not think that is very kind to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40185" name="Bob Ainsworth">the right hon. Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase>. When he came to the Dispatch Box a few weeks before Christmas in 2009, he announced that there would be 22 new Chinook helicopters. He did not sign a contract or find the money to pay for them but he announced there would be 22 new Chinook helicopters. I do not know whether in the fantasy budget of the Labour party it does not think that that was a commitment, but it was one of the commitments that that Defence Secretary made, and it was on that basis that the &#163;38 billion black hole was presented to us by officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.1/5">I do not call into question the personal commitment of the hon. Member for North Durham, but he has to recognise that his motion opposes everything that this Government are doing and is pretty scant when it comes to proposing any alternatives. He says that he recognises the need for defence reform, but the only response in his motion is to be concerned, &#8220;anxious&#8221; and &#8220;worried&#8221; about how we are clearing up the mess he made. He has not presented one properly costed plan or given us a coherent alternative. He has not given us a plan A, let alone a plan B. He needs to recognise that he has to do better if he wants to hold us to account for what we have done.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.0/1">Does the Minister think the decision he has just criticised was better or worse than switching to a &#8220;cat and trap&#8221; system when first coming into office and then reversing that decision at great cost only a year later?</p>

	<p pid="c.244.1/1">I think it was a perfectly sensible alternative to explore the &#8220;cat and trap&#8221; option. As we said at the time, it would have given us the ability to project a much better aircraft type off the carrier. I think that to commission the detailed work on that proposal was entirely responsible. If it ends up costing us the maximum, as the Secretary of State suggested, of &#163;100 million, that is a small sum compared with the &#163;1.5 billion the previous Government added to the carrier project in one afternoon, when they announced from the Dispatch Box that it was to be postponed by a year. That was a far greater drain on the defence budget than the relatively small bounded study, which unfortunately concluded that the costs of going ahead with the plan were such that it was not viable.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/2">The shadow Defence Secretary has identified &#163;5 billion of cuts that he says he supports, but that would barely scratch the surface of the black hole that his party&#8217;s Government left behind. Of course, his cuts are not new; they are already being made. On Labour&#8217;s current public plans, the defence budget would still be in chaos. They have pledged neither to make any extra savings, nor to restore the cuts that have been made. What is interesting is not what they are saying in public, but what they are saying in private. Earlier, reference was made to the interesting correspondence between the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Defence Secretary. It is worth quoting the letter from the Leader of the Opposition to his colleague, dated <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-23">23 January</phrase> this year:</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/3">&#8220;You have powerfully made the case in your recent interventions that there is no easy future for Defence expenditure and clearly in the context of the current fiscal position we can expect to have to make further savings after the next election.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/4">In public, the Opposition are against the cuts that we are making, but in secret, they are planning even deeper defence cuts. Today&#8217;s debate is not simply opposition, but opportunism as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.2/1">We said that at the last general election. What we were not going to do is rush the process. I challenge the Minister of State to place in the Library of the House the details of how he arrived at the &#163;38 billion figure. Today he has said something that no other Minister has ever said: that the &#163;38 billion is over 10 years. The impression has always been given</p>
	<p pid="c.244.2/2">that it is there right now. Will he produce that information? Without it, some of the cuts he is making are not credible.</p>

	<p pid="c.245.0/1">That is absolute nonsense. It has been clear from the outset that the &#163;38 billion figure was over 10 years. I remember many a debate with the shadow Defence Secretary about whether we were talking about the 10 years being measured out on the spending side in flat real or in flat cash, and I have said again tonight that it was by reference to flat real. It has always been a 10-year figure, and the suggestion that we have magicked &#163;38 billion out of spending in two years is clearly nonsensical; it has always been over 10 years. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman further details of how we worked that out, but there is no getting away from the fact that the Labour Government left behind a massive black hole. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40231" name="Jim Murphy">The right hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy)</phrase> has identified a tiny number of cuts that he thinks need to be made and he has secret plans to make more, but he is not prepared to face up the difficult decisions that have to be made to clear up the economic inheritance across the piece and specifically in defence.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/2">Transforming Britain&#8217;s armed forces by implementing the 2010 SDSR is necessary to recover capabilities after a decade of enduring operations. It is necessary to prepare the armed forces for a future in which threats are diverse, evolving and unpredictable. It is necessary to help to tackle the fiscal deficit and to put the defence budget and equipment plan back into balance. We have to build for the future with strict financial discipline, making certain that the armed forces have confidence that projects in the programme are funded and will be delivered. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last month, the black hole has now been eliminated and the 10-year defence budget is now in balance. I readily acknowledge that Future Force 2020 will be a smaller fighting force, but it will still be able to deploy a brigade-sized force on a sustained basis on operations, or a divisional-sized force on a best effort.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/3">There was much criticism from the hon. Member for North Durham because we have had to reduce manpower numbers, but it is worth noting that in the memo the Opposition defence team sent back to the leader of their party, they said, in reference to Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel, that they recognised that there would be reductions in personnel numbers. On Army restructuring, too, the memo stated that they recognised the need for manpower reductions. So they recognise the need for the measures we are taking; they just do not like the grim reality of having to do it.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/4">Despite all the changes that we are making, we will still be supported by the fourth-largest defence budget in the world, meeting our financial responsibilities to NATO. We will configure the armed forces for a world where threats to our homeland and allies are increasingly to be found outside Europe, rather than on the north German plain, and we will move from a heavily armoured force to a more mobile, adaptable and deployable force.</p>

Reports suggest that 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers is to be axed, despite being one of the best recruited battalions in the British Army and forecast to remain so. Does the Minister accept that decisions about which battalions to axe should be based on the ability to recruit? In that case, the Ministry of Defence should be looking at the Scottish battalions, which consistently have trouble recruiting, with their numbers made up by English soldiers. I would suggest that no Englishman should ever be forced to wear a kilt.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.5/1">There is speculation that the process is being elongated, perhaps over a number of months, because of political considerations. Does my hon.

	<p pid="c.247.0/1">I agree. Uncertainty always has a destabilising effect. I can assure him and the members of the armed forces that they will not have long to wait. However, it is more important that we get this right than that we do it quickly. These decisions are a once-in-a-generation rebalancing of the Army&#8217;s structure. If we get it wrong, the Army will suffer the consequences for decades to come, so it is important to take a little time and get it right. The House will not have long to wait for announcements to be made.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.2/1">Let me say first to my hon. Friend that the issue of disbandment of battalions, which we were just discussing, and redundancy have nothing to do with each other, so nobody should read into the decisions that are taken about particular battalions that members of those battalions will be made redundant. In answer to the specific question that he puts, nobody has been selected on the basis of their proximity to a retirement date, but inevitably it is the case that where there are lines, some unfortunate souls will fall just the wrong side of the line. It is a matter of great regret, but the redundancy payments will in any case be bigger than the lump sums that those personnel would have received at retirement.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.3/1">In making the very difficult decisions that my hon.

	<p pid="c.247.4/1">In no way will they be singled out. These decisions are being made in the most objective and scientific way we can make them, but inevitably some who serve from overseas will be affected and others will be more fortunate. There is no getting away from that.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.4/2">Some of the reductions that are to take place will be accounted for by reduced recruiting and fewer extensions of service, but as I said, a redundancy programme is, sadly, inevitable to ensure that the right balance of skills is maintained across the rank structures. Compulsory redundancy will not apply, as we have made clear from the outset, to those in receipt of the operational allowance, those within six months of deploying, or those on post-operational tour leave following those deployments. In all cases it is for the individual service to determine how the necessary reductions can be achieved and over what timeline, making sure that the right mix of skills, experience and ranks are retained.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.4/3">The main programme for the Royal Navy and the RAF have been concluded, but protecting the Army&#8217;s contribution to Afghanistan has meant that two further tranches are still to come for the Army. We will, as I said, make an announcement on Army 2020 very shortly, which will provide clarity on the future structure of the Army. We will have a land force of 120,000, composed of a Regular Army of 82,000, plus 30,000 reserves and</p>
	<p pid="c.247.4/4">an 8,000 training margin. An Army of this composition will have to be structured differently, and it is impossible to do that without losing and merging some units.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.4/5">Although we cannot avoid difficult decisions as the Army gets smaller, we will seek to do this in the most sensitive way possible, respecting the traditions of the Army, respecting the traditions of our great regiments, but always recognising that military effectiveness must be the first requirement in designing our future structure.</p>

	<p pid="c.248.0/1">I commend what my hon. Friend has just said. When we think about which TA regiments to keep, which to lose and where to put them, I urge him to bear in mind that a unit in the Territorial Army cannot be moved more than a very small distance without losing the people. It is even more critical than in the Regular Army to pick those that have an officer and soldier base that is well recruited; many units do not have such a base. It is vital that we build on the best ones.</p>

	<p pid="c.248.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, which is being taken into account as these difficult decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/2">The current financial situation makes it difficult to act as swiftly as we would wish to address some of the issues that make day-to-day life that bit more difficult for personnel and their families. Mention was made of the pause we have had to make on major housing upgrades, but thankfully the &#163;100 million additional investment in accommodation that was announced in the Budget will deliver more than 1,000 new and refurbished single living and service family accommodation units. That will help the MOD to continue to meet its commitment, set out in the armed forces covenant, only to allocate homes that are standard 2 or above.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/3">On the issue of the covenant, I start by recognising the important work done by the hon. Member for North Durham, along with the right hon. Member for Coventry North East, in preparing the ground for the publication of the tri-service armed forces covenant in May last year, which built on many of the suggestions in their Command Paper. We have been able to double the operational tax-free allowance and we have improved rest and recuperation. Council tax relief has been doubled twice since the Government took office, and now stands at nearly &#163;600 per person for a six-month deployment. In health care, we are investing up to &#163;15 million in prosthetics provision for personnel who have lost limbs during service, extended access to mental health and increased the number of veterans&#8217; mental health nurses.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/4">On education, we have set up scholarships for bereaved service children, provided financial help for service leavers who want higher and further education, and introduced the pupil premium for the children of those currently serving, making extra funds available for state schools with service children. More than 50 councils have signed up to the community covenant scheme with another 47 planning to do so, and there is a &#163;30 million grant pot to support that. However, there is a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/5">For the first time, the armed forces covenant has been formally published and recognised in legislation, and we are working across Government to ensure that no disadvantage is faced by armed forces personnel, their families and veterans compared with other citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.1/6">Every since the publication of the SDSR, the Opposition have been calling for another SDSR. They went 12 years in government without one, but they now seem to want another one every time the wind blows. We have put in place a system for regular strategic review through the National Security Council, and preparations for the SDSR of 2015 are already under way in the MOD. However, none of the strategic assumptions underpinning the 2010 SDSR have significantly changed, so we will press ahead with the implementation of the SDSR based on formidable, adaptable and high-tech armed forces, built on balanced budgets and supported by an effective and efficient MOD, taking the tough decisions that the previous Government ducked, providing our armed forces with the tools they need to do the job we ask of them, upholding the armed forces covenant, and protecting this country&#8217;s national security, which is the first and foremost duty of any Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.249.2/1">We got a lot of heat from the Minister, but we are not much clearer on the key issue on which I want to expand&#8212;defence procurement. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40185" name="Bob Ainsworth">the Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase> have already made excellent points on the issue. It is of course true that any incoming Government at the last election would have had to make savings and the process could have been difficult. The Labour Government put in place the process to consider how we should do that, but the important thing was to learn and see where the next Government could improve. So far, the signs are that this Government have comprehensively failed to do that.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/2">When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, who became Defence Secretary, was not making promises in opposition about increasing the size of the Army, he used to tell the House how terrible it was that Ministers increased the costs of projects by delaying them, but in government his party is doing precisely that, with significant added cost to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/3">As we have seen again today, Ministers are patting themselves on the back as if they have finally and magically squared the circle on defence procurement. I am afraid that what they have done is simply seek the appearance of order, in the manner of a child tidying his bedroom in great haste. They have done this in a number of ways. Some costs have been swept under the bed, increasing the burden on taxpayers and storing up risk for future years. In that category, of course, I include the successor deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/4">Ministers can announce the necessary long-lead items initiated in recent weeks with as much fanfare as they like&#8212;they know that I have welcomed the commencement of each one so far&#8212;but they know that that is now being done to a tight timetable and with increased costs</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/5">caused by the delay they imposed in bringing the successor into service when they first came into office. When the Defence Secretary boasts about balancing the procurement budget, he knows that that has been made possible only by shifting the project&#8217;s cost profile to the right, largely out of this spending round, which is precisely what Conservative Members used to rail against from the Opposition Benches. The extra cost of refuelling the existing Vanguard class submarines alone, which was made necessary by the delay, was estimated at between &#163;1.2 billion and &#163;1.4 billion by the former Secretary of State. We are yet to hear the full cost of this exercise in political management and short-term debt clearing. Perhaps the Minister will seek to enlighten us when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/6">In their desperation to present a false image of order, the Government have gone beyond simply sweeping things out of immediate sight. Some projects have been subjected to the procurement equivalent of being hastily hurled out of the window, with little thought for the waste that that causes or, most importantly, the implications for national security. Any claim they might have made to have got to grips with defence procurement was surely destroyed by the farce over the aircraft carriers, which my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham set out well in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.2/7">The final trick for those worried about their shoddy work being exposed is simply to turn off the lights. The Government have produced no credible evidence today or in the past about where this &#163;38 billion has come from or how it will be filled in future. We are left with a lingering lack of certainty over the cost of big-ticket items and the personnel are bearing the brunt, with the Army that the Government promised to expand possibly set to get another whack. The books are cooked on the assumption of long-term increases in MOD funding post-2015, and black holes, which were never properly described in the first place, are apparently filled. The truth is that Ministers do not have a grip on procurement or cost overruns and have failed to put considered policy and the defence interests of the nation ahead of political posturing.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.0/1">For the past 40 years, RAF Leuchars in my constituency has been responsible for providing air defence for the northern half of the United Kingdom. It is ideally situated for the purpose, close to centres of population and training areas, and easily able to deal with intrusion by aircraft&#8212;formerly Soviet and now Russian&#8212;into British airspace. Even as this debate takes place, there are aircraft at Leuchars on standby to provide the quick reaction alert, which is an essential part of our air defence. Even as this debate is taking place, No. 6 Typhoon squadron has been stood up and is fully operational, and No. 1 Typhoon squadron is in the course of being stood up. Even now, preparations are taking place for one of the Royal Air Force&#8217;s few remaining air shows, which provides a valuable shop window, and it is able to do that, in particular, because of the accessibility of RAF Leuchars to Scotland&#8217;s central belt.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/2">I have no doubt that a seamless and uninterrupted build-up of the Typhoon force is essential to the security of the United Kingdom. Is it true that Leuchars now has a dedicated Typhoon engine bay? Is it true that</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/3">there is now a dedicated Typhoon ejection-seat facility at Leuchars? Is it true that there is Typhoon-specific survival equipment at Leuchars? Is it true that there are Typhoon-modified power supplies and Typhoo-specific IT systems already in place? It is suggested that the Army might be sent in some form or another to Leuchars, but it has not been possible to identify any capital investment in advance of such a decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/4">We know that the proposal is to transfer to Lossiemouth, but no preparations have been made there for the arrival of Typhoon squadrons, which allows me, I hope, the colloquialism, &#8220;Leuchars ain&#8217;t broke, why is it necessary to fix it?&#8221; The truth is that Leuchars is in the right place at the right time and doing the right job.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/5">Typhoon aircraft from Leuchars can be over London 12 minutes sooner than Typhoon aircraft flying from Lossiemouth. The Olympics, as the head of MI5 identified only yesterday, will be a severe test of our security, but that test is unlikely to end with the Olympic games, and the capacity to provide air defence throughout the United Kingdom will be an essential feature of our future security.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/6">I have a profound belief that the original decision to move the Typhoon aircraft from Leuchars to Lossiemouth was based on financial and political considerations, which were put ahead of strategic obligations and of the clear operational advantages provided by Leuchars. The financial case has been substantially undermined by the Army reductions that we have heard about, by the rejection of the building of a super-base at Kirknewton near Edinburgh, by the inability of the Ministry of Defence to obtain the sums originally estimated for the sale of properties such as Redford barracks, also in Edinburgh, and by the additional costs of transferring Typhoons to Lossiemouth and of operating from Lossiemouth once they have been transferred there.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.0/7">In my view, there is no question but that the deployment of the Typhoon force should be revisited as part of the ongoing review to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred but a moment or two ago. The original decision was flawed. It will be even more flawed if it is executed in the way that is proposed.</p>

	<p pid="c.251.0/1">I, like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, look at some of the defence reforms&#8212;I use the word &#8220;reforms&#8221; very loosely&#8212;and have to question the decisions that were made, including whether they were in the best interests of the defence and security of the United Kingdom, or in the best interests of the Treasury-driven agenda to cut spending.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/2">Chief among my concerns is the scrapping of the Nimrod MRA4, which has denied us the ability to protect our nuclear deterrent and offshore oil and gas platforms properly; to gather intelligence of threats developing way beyond our coastline such as in the high north; to respond adequately to offshore emergencies; and to contribute to international efforts against terrorism and piracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/3">The Government assumption that we can do without maritime capability until 2020, with the replacement of the MRA4 not being commissioned prior to 2015 and an average commissioning period of five years, is nonsensical. We lost not just Nimrod, but the individuals</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/4">with the skills that need to be nurtured in the area; and they are not just skills that we need to retain in design, building, flying and the analysis of electronic intelligence data, but skills that we cannot afford to see fleeing the country for work abroad, as is happening now.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/5">The loss of the Harriers&#8212;sold for spare parts, we were told&#8212;was based on the short-sighted assumption that we can do without planes to fly from our carriers. Ministers insisted that it was a good deal for the British taxpayer, but as one US rear admiral said:</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/6">&#8220;We&#8217;re taking advantage of all the money the Brits have spent on them. It&#8217;s like we are buying a car with 15,000 miles on it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/7">We are losing our prestige overseas, and we should not underestimate how we have gone from being a respected player on the international stage to being, in many quarters, pitied for what we have lost and can no longer do.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/8">We have been well accustomed to the problems of defence procurement and the conspiracy of optimism that has led to delayed and expensive procurement decisions, but the Ministry of Defence is in great danger of falling into the same trap with its plans for Future Force 2020. The plan seems simple&#8212;rebalancing the armed forces to increase the number of reservists, thereby saving money but gaining the benefits of the skills and experience that reservists can bring. I have to say that there is a shocking naivety in this plan. Members of our armed forces are tough, resilient people who welcome the challenges thrown at them, but I fear that reducing their numbers to 82,000 will mean that we face overstretch, burn-out and a loss of capacity, skills and capability.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/9">As part of Future Force 2020, a threat is hanging over many regiments, including the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards. That is deeply unsettling. I make no pretence about the difficulty of the decision to be made, but the amalgamation of any Welsh regiments will be a bitter pill to swallow, especially given the Prime Minister&#8217;s speech in the Welsh Assembly this time last year, when he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.251.0/10">&#8220;While speaking about the part that Wales has played in our past and present, I want to put on record&#8230;here&#8230;my gratitude to the brave Welsh regiments. From the trenches of northern France to the mountains of South Korea, they have fought and died in defence of our nation and values. Today, in Afghanistan, they continue to serve with courage and distinction, and I pay tribute to them. For them, and for all the people of Wales, I will always be an advocate of this country and everything that it has to offer.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.252.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very powerful point in reading that quote. She knows just how angry people in Wales are about the uncertainty facing the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards.

	<p pid="c.252.1/1">I certainly do think it is very important that the Welsh Affairs Committee looks into the issue, but it needs particularly to consider the most important part of it&#8212;the potential future of all three major Welsh regiments. It is also right that Defence Ministers should be available to answer questions. In Wales, the sons, daughters, brothers, sisters and families of our regiments are deeply distressed at the potential loss of one of the regiments.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/2">Defence reform risks becoming defence vandalism&#8212;destroying trust, reputations, capability, capacity and skills that are urgently needed to protect our country in these uncertain times. We in Wales take this extremely seriously, because we risk losing important regiments that make important contributions to the defence of the UK. It is the equivalent of leaving all the windows and doors in one&#8217;s house open to potential burglars and going up to bed. However, it is not a burglar who I fear coming into the house that is the UK; it is a murderer, who will murder us in our beds because we have failed to put in place the protections that we need.</p>

When the Defence Committee requests time in this Chamber, it is always keen to have a motion that will not divide the House, and I have always tried to adopt that non-partisan attitude in events and campaigns that I have run for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines&#8212;for example, in asking the shadow Secretary of State to co-host last year&#8217;s Trafalgar day event with me.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/3">I therefore approach an Opposition day debate on defence with a heavy heart, but today I have a doubly heavy heart because I have to correct a falsehood that has been running for the past few days, perpetuated by Labour&#8217;s spin operation. I do not believe that the shadow Secretary of State or his shadow Ministers would have been involved in this, but I hope that in winding up they will take the time to correct it.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/4">Portsmouth dockyard is the home of the surface fleet. It has a wonderful natural harbour, which is being dredged to house the new carriers. New power facilities are being built, and moves are afoot to put the vacant historic dockyard to new use so that it ceases to be a drain on the defence budget. The operational stress that the carriers will be under will be considerable, so repair and support services must sit alongside the ships in their home port. There is much activity, much investment and more work for the dockyard&#8217;s partners and suppliers, most notably Rolls-Royce in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/5">In the face of all that activity and progress, Labour has spent the past few days telling those who work in the dockyard and their families that it will close. It has not been discussing the BAE review; it has been telling people that the Royal Navy base is toast. That is a new low. Government Members have come to expect Labour policy and its lines to take to be divorced from reality, especially where the economy is concerned, but I had thought, perhaps naively, that defence might warrant a more grown-up attitude. This sort of distortion is indefensible not just because of the unnecessary hurt and worry that is caused to people in my constituency, but because of the damage that it causes to British businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/6">We have to retain a shipbuilding capability in the UK&#8212;it is a sovereign capability. To afford the Royal Navy ships of the future, we need a slower drumbeat in</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/7">our yards in building those ships. We therefore need to export more Royal Navy-designed ships. We also need to make better use of the gaps in work in our yards, rather than put the brakes on contracts, especially those that will deliver much-needed and much-missed capability, such as carrier strike force.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/8">There is a gap between the carrier work finishing and the building of the new Type 26 combat ship starting. Rather than making the mistakes of the last Government and paying for the work to be delivered slower, we should use that time and money to do something more useful, using designs that we already have. We should build ocean patrol vessels and perhaps an ice ship, which would certainly be of use. That would be a better use of public funds, retain the capability and provide more options either to carry out operations or to generate funds for the Department. We must have no let-up in the Government activity to hook in any buyer who is looking to purchase a combat ship. I know that Ministers are considering all those options.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/9">These are important issues, but on them, Labour is silent. It does not seem to be remotely interested in ensuring that the Government do the right thing, that we have the capability that we need or that we are getting value for money. Nor has it stated what its view is on the future of shipbuilding in the UK. Instead, over the past few days Labour&#8217;s press office has misled people in my constituency by saying that the Navy base will close. The Government could not have been clearer in their statement that all three Navy bases will be retained. The shadow ministerial team know that. I therefore hope that whichever shadow Minister responds to the debate will tell us what they think about shipbuilding in the UK. At the very least, they should state that they know that the Government are committed to the three Royal Navy bases.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.0/10">The shadow Ministers should reflect on the actions of their party over the past few days. If Labour wants to have a debate about the BAE Systems review, that is fine. I will show up. In the meantime, I ask that it treats my constituents working in and with the armed forces with a greater degree of respect.</p>

	<p pid="c.254.0/1">With all the pressure on defence spending in this country and abroad, it is hardly surprising that at the NATO summit in Chicago, smart defence was one of the key items of discussion and NATO pledged to do more with less. I believe that NATO, like the Defence Ministries in its member states, will deliver greater value for money if its expenditure is transparent, subject to independent audit and scrutinised by Parliaments in member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/2">NATO&#8217;s external audit function is overseen by the International Board of Auditors for NATO, which consists of six board members who are nominated by the national delegations. The members rotate between the NATO member states, so there is no continuity of oversight. The IBAN board is accountable not to Parliaments, as is the National Audit Office in relation to UK defence expenditure, but to the North Atlantic Council, the executive branch of NATO. The audits are carried out by 22 able members of staff, who are not independent, but are employed by NATO.</p>

	<p pid="c.255.0/1">As an ex-NATO officer, may I point out that the North Atlantic Council can sit in Prime Minister or President form, Foreign Minister form, Defence Minister form or permanent representative form? Governments are therefore represented on the North Atlantic Council, to which IBAN reports.</p>

	<p pid="c.255.1/1">Governments are represented, but Parliaments are not. The principle in the UK is that the National Audit Office belongs and reports to Parliament. It has reported to Parliament for 150 years on UK defence expenditure, while obviously keeping secret things that must necessarily be kept secret, so there is no reason why we cannot have public reporting of defence expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/2">NATO&#8217;s international board of auditors audited 49 separate sets of NATO accounts last year. I recently met Tim Banfield, a director of the NAO who is responsible for UK defence audits. He told me that NATO&#8217;s financial statements are frequently audited late, sometimes by as much as three years, which is not compliant with decent accounting standards&#8212;auditors who are trying to track expenditure cannot find the answers to the questions they need to ask three years after an operation has closed down. I asked a Foreign Office Minister how good the audits are, because they are not published. He told me that of the 49 sets of accounts last year, 14 were qualified by the auditors because of irregularities.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/3">In addition to the financial audits, five performance audits&#8212;value-for-money audits&#8212;were carried out last year, but there is little evidence that NATO changes how it works to improve value for money in response to their conclusions. Only one of those 49 sets of accounts has been put into the public domain, according to NATO&#8217;s website.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/4">The failure to publish accounts reduces the pressure on NATO managers to respond to deficiencies when they are revealed by audits, and to improve their performance. I raise this matter with the Minister now because I believe there is a narrow window of opportunity to change things, because the NATO Secretary-General has commissioned the new deputy Secretary-General to review the audit function. I shall share with the House a brief extract from a document provided by the Secretary-General to national delegations, including the UK ambassador to NATO. The Secretary-General said:</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/5">&#8220;We must adopt best practices employed by other international organisations. NATO is very unusual in having its own auditing service&#8230;Organisations that employ external public-service auditors include UNESCO, WTO, OSCE and the OECD.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/6">To bring us into line with best practice, I propose the adoption of the same approach, phased in to ensure continuity of work.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/7">He goes on to make the point that the only other body that does not have an independent external audit function is the EU, from which some hon. Members would not like to take lessons in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/8">The NATO Secretary-General clearly wants change, but the decision will not be made by him; it will be made by the North Atlantic Council. Will the UK representative at the North Atlantic Council, whether our ambassador, one of our Ministers or the Prime Minister, support the change agenda? Will the deputy Secretary-General&#8217;s report be shown to the NAO and the supreme audit institutions of other member states, such as the US Government Accountability Office, for comment before it is shown to the North Atlantic Council? Will our ambassador lobby representatives of other member states</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/9">to build a coalition to change the audit function within NATO and to bring the information, apart from that which necessarily must be kept secret for security reasons, into the public domain?</p>
	<p pid="c.255.1/10">That information will drive improved value for money within NATO. NATO can hardly urge its member states to deliver more value for money if it does not take a lead by doing so itself.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.0/1">I declare an interest as a member of the Territorial Army.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/2">I listened with interest to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, who has just left his place. I thought he was a perfectly competent Defence Minister, although not quite as competent as the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" name="Andrew Robathan">the Member for South Leicestershire (Mr Robathan)</phrase>. Having listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s remarks, I am clear about several matters being pursued by the Government that he does not support, but, given his acceptance that there is a deficit and that it needs to be addressed, I am less clear about what exactly the Labour party would do to address it. I hope that in her winding-up speech <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" name="Gemma Doyle">the hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)</phrase> will explain to the House exactly what the Labour party would do to deal with the deficit. Without that explanation, I fear that many of its claims will look rather hollow.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/3">I want to focus on the plan for an integrated Army by 2020. I congratulate General Carter on his review. Frankly, he was handed a poisoned chalice, but he has managed to deliver an optimal military solution from very clear terms of reference. I want to be equally controversial by saying that sometimes arguments in the House about which regiments should be saved leave me slightly cold. I understand the historic significance of many regiments, and it is right that hon. Members should defend those regiments, but ultimately, if I were a senior officer, I would be holding my head in my hands, because, following this review, politicians are now tinkering with it and seeking to influence the decision for reasons based on political grounds, rather than optimal military grounds. It is not beyond the wit of the British Army to save various regimental cap badges, so I think that my hon. Friends should relax&#8212;I am sure that these cap badges will be saved. Instead, we must focus on the optimal military solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/4">The integrated Army 2020 proposition, the skeleton of which was unveiled earlier this month at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference, is a neat solution to dealing with a period of strategic uncertainty at a time of economic austerity, and inevitably it involves smaller land forces. Indeed, it proposes a reduction in the regular force from 102,000 to 82,000, countered by an increase in the trained reserve forces to about 30,000, with an additional 8,000 under training. It aims to deliver an Army designed to meet the capability, aspirations and commitments of the strategic defence and security review 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/5">Equally, however, the proposal has to deliver contingent capabilities and meet the requirements of the Government&#8217;s &#8220;Building Stability Overseas Strategy&#8221;, published last year. Although I am confident that General Carter&#8217;s proposals provide an optimal military solution for the requirements of the SDSR, some cross-Government</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/6">work is clearly still required to flesh out how this upstream engagement in fragile states will be delivered in order to meet the requirements of the overseas stability strategy. It is here, I believe, that the unique specialist skills that so many members of the reserve forces possess should be utilised. As I understand it, the proposed force structure aims to hold defence capabilities at different levels of readiness based on a balanced mix of reaction and adaptable forces. It is key, however, that to deliver this desired outcome, the Army must be able predictably to integrate its regular and reserve components, with the reserves likely to be required routinely to undertake roles such as providing for the UN battalion in Cyprus, as it has done sporadically in the past.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.0/7">At the heart of the plan is a progressive move from a reserve force that provides individual augmentees for current operations to one that delivers a scalable, adaptable response by individuals to formed sub-units. This aspiration would certainly be welcomed by the TA, but will be welcomed by the Regular Army only if the TA can be relied upon to deliver. For the individual reservists, this calls for sustained commitment to regular training attendance and predictable periodic mobilisation. This is undoubtedly an ambitious target, but it can be achieved. It is important to realise, however, that there must be not only the military will to achieve it but significant political will and leadership, if the structure and reliance on reserves is to work.</p>

	<p pid="c.257.0/1">There is one other requirement: money for the reserves to train properly. Otherwise, they cannot attain the same level as the regular forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.257.1/1">I agree. Indeed, I would argue that ambition without funding is simply hallucination, which is why I am delighted that &#163;1.2 billion has been allocated for this upskilling of the reserves.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/2">I have two concerns about the upskilling, however. First, I want to add to the comment from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>. When it comes to the reserve units, we must be careful, because a larger TA might actually result in a smaller footprint. We must be careful about which TA units we close, simply because, as I know from my experience as an officer commanding a squadron, we cannot simply move personnel and expect them to move units and travel some 20 miles to continue training.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/3">Equally, I am convinced that there must be a compulsion to train. At the moment, we simply have a gentlemen&#8217;s agreement to turn up and train with the TA. Without that compulsion, I fear that the reserves cannot fulfil the commitment that they are being asked to make. We are fortunate that section 22 in part III of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 already allows for compulsory training, but we need to look carefully at how to implement it, so that we do not end up offending employers, who might then not wish to allow their reservists to go and train. It is a very difficult circle to square. Equally, we need to look at TA regulations to ensure that bounty, a tax-free payment for people who are fit for role, can be adjusted to ensure that such compulsion can be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/4">In my last 27 seconds, I would like to highlight to hon. Members that tomorrow is &#8220;wear your uniform to work&#8221; day, which is a celebration of our reserve forces,</p>
	<p pid="c.257.1/5">with some 1,900 of them currently being mobilised in support of the Olympics and some 700 on operations in Afghanistan. I hope that hon. Members will join me in celebrating their reservists, although they do not have to go as far as I will by wearing my uniform tomorrow.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="258"  time="021:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0003.htm#120626129000082">
	<p pid="c.258.0/1">This is the first opportunity I have found in the parliamentary calendar to make any remarks about the Government&#8217;s defence procurement White Paper, which came out in February. Unfortunately, it was issued as a written ministerial statement, so there was no opportunity for debate. I do think it is worth looking at what that defence procurement White Paper says. On a number of occasions, I have raised with Ministers my concerns, which arose out of spending the last nine months, along with many trade unionists, employees and family members, fighting for workers at BAE Systems in Brough, who are facing 800 or 900 redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/2">We have heard a lot this evening about being in economic difficulties and about the deficit that we need to get down, and it seems to me that defence procurement provides potential not only for growth but for defence exports. I think the Government are missing a trick in this area. My understanding of the White Paper is that the Government are moving towards open procurement, buying off the shelf and getting good value for money, that there is no preferential treatment for British industry or British manufacturers and that they will protect the operational advantage and freedom of action of this country only where it is essential to national security. As I said, the economy is flatlining and we are in a double-dip recession, but we know that countries that invest in, and buy from, their own home-grown defence industries do the best at exporting around the world. That makes sense: if a Government are willing to buy from their own industry, it shows a commitment to, and a belief in, providing the very best. That is absolutely what we want for our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/3">Brough is the home of the Hawk, and when the Red Arrows go around the country and the world flying the Hawk, people know that it is an excellent, British-manufactured plane. The Red Arrows display amazing acrobatic aeronautical feats, showing again Britain&#8217;s excellence in manufacturing. My real concern, then, is about the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s approach to future procurement, as it seems to treat itself as if it were a private company, just looking for best value and not recognising that it is part of the Government as a whole. The Government have a commitment&#8212;the Opposition support them in this&#8212;to growth and rebalancing the economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/4">An interesting piece of work has been done on &#8220;The Destinations of the Defence Pound&#8221;. It is a RUSI&#8212;Royal United Services Institute&#8212;pamphlet written by Trevor Taylor and John Louth. They point out that buying off the shelf has a negative effect on Government revenues so it does not help the country to deal with the public sector deficit. Buying British, on the other hand, will ensure that British taxes are paid during the course of the procurement process, and there is likely to be a British supply chain, too. The pamphlet shows that spending &#163;1 million will lead to a 36% return to the Exchequer via tax, national insurance and other means. It does not go into the wider benefits, which would obviously include</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/5">jobs&#8212;a key issue for the Government and the Opposition at this time. Then there are all the other multiplier effects of buying from the home defence industry. If the Government buy abroad, that money&#8212;those taxes&#8212;will go to another Government, and will be lost to us.</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/6">It would be helpful if the Minister said something about the European procurement defence directive, and about the need for us to monitor carefully what other countries are doing. Why does the United States of America, when it purchases defence items, demand that they be produced in the United States, and why, in most cases, is any company applying to that market required to have a United States partner even to get a hearing?</p>
	<p pid="c.258.0/7">I should like the Government to hold a proper debate on procurement, because I think that it might give them an opportunity to get themselves out of the economic difficulties into which they have got themselves since May 2010. Given that we are now in a double-dip recession, such a debate might be of help to them.</p>

	<p pid="c.259.0/1">In the light of your injunction, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall shorten what I was going to say, and speed up what I am going to say, in order to stay well within the time limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/2">It is a pleasure to speak in the debate, occurring as it does on the 150th anniversary of the first investiture of the Victoria Cross in Hyde park. My constituent Samuel Parkes&#8212;a long-dead constituent, I should add&#8212;was the first private soldier to receive the Victoria Cross, so the debate has extra significance and resonance for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/3">I was pleased and privileged to serve on the Committee that considered the Armed Forces Bill, which became the Armed Forces Act 2011 and which enshrined the armed forces covenant in law. Although it is fair to say that the Opposition were broadly supportive of the implementation of the covenant, it is also pertinent to point out that it was implemented within a year of the coalition Government&#8217;s inheriting a parlous economic state. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" name="Gemma Doyle">The hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)</phrase> was involved in the Committee stage of the Bill. It is clear that the Opposition, although they played their part in the covenant&#8217;s implementation, had 13 years in which to introduce a covenant themselves. They had the time, the money and the majority to introduce one, yet they failed to do so. I am pleased that they appear to be supporting what we achieved tonight.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/4">We in Tamworth recruit heavily to the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment, the former Staffordshire Regiment. Housing is one of the biggest issues raised by my constituents who are in the forces, and by their families. Given the strides that we have already made in improving housing, I hope that, as the Strachan report is implemented and as we proceed with the covenant and report on it, we will do three further things.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/5">I hope that we will increase the accommodation allowances that are available to our servicemen and women, and will expand the pilot shared equity scheme that was introduced by the last Government. I know that the Minister for Housing and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, has announced that &#163;400 million will be spent on helping 10,000 families with the Firstbuy scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/6">I also hope that we will help more armed forces families to get on to the property ladder. I hope that we will do something that will cost my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State nothing, and prevail on the Chancellor to prevail on the banks to offer more forces-friendly mortgages to help servicemen and women and their families to secure a fixed address, a stable home, and a foot on that property ladder. If we send people abroad to fight for us, it seems only right and proper that we should help them to get a decent home, at home. Such action would also help to reduce the &#163;285 million a year that it costs to service 50,000 homes for forces personnel, some of which is sub-standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/7">The motion suggests that the Opposition still want to make the armed forces covenant very prescriptive. That flies in the face of the messages that we receive from the service chiefs and from the armed forces families&#8217; representatives, who have said that they want a much more flexible and current armed forces covenant that can respond to the current concerns of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/8">I conclude by quoting Bryn Parry, founder of Help for Heroes. He said in the Armed Forces Bill Committee just 12 months or so ago:</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/9">&#8220;I have never seen something written down or the principles of something discussed or made into law work as well as somebody who gets up and says, &#8216;Right, this is what I want to happen. Let&#8217;s make it go.&#8217;&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Armed Forces Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-02-10">10 February 2011</phrase>; Q336.]</p>
	<p pid="c.259.0/10">That sums up what the armed forces covenant should be: a flexible arrangement and a current arrangement&#8212;and I trust my right hon. Friend the Minister will make it go.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.0/1">Members may know of my concerns regarding the number of military personnel who end up in trouble after leaving the services, and sometimes end up on the street. The Welsh Affairs Committee is currently taking evidence on that, as well as on the regiments question.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/2">Wales has traditionally provided more than our share of military personnel. It makes sense that returning Welsh veterans&#8212;and, indeed, returning English and Scottish veterans&#8212;should be treated as close to their families as possible and should have their fair share of resources from charities and the UK Government, to help them recover from their injuries. Having seen how the US treats its veterans, I am sure there are lessons we can still learn. Some of the earlier comments on the covenant are most welcome, however.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/3">Certainly one lesson we can learn is the importance of ensuring that former members of the armed forces do not feel that they are left behind when they are discharged from the services. The cuts that have happened, and those that are currently taking place, must take into account the need for support networks to be in place for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/4">In Wales, there is a great deal of concern about proposals to merge or disband Welsh regiments such as the 1st The Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards, also known as the Welsh cavalry, and The Royal Welsh, which includes battalions from the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Welsh Regiment&#8212;it was only recently put together, and one would have thought it would have stayed in place for a while.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/5">The reduction in the number of Welsh regiments to three has already left a bitter taste, and further cuts will lead to a feeling that Welsh regiments are not being recognised and appreciated for their effort and dedication. Successive generations have joined the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards and fought with pride, honour and determination. Some argue that this is due to the method of recruitment, with cultural ties and local knowledge being part of both recruitment and loyalty. New recruits should have the opportunity to choose an armoured regiment or infantry regiment in which they will feel comfortable and safe in the company of their peers while facing potentially dangerous circumstances. However, despite the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards carrying out more operational tours in the past 20 years than any other armoured regiment, it is under threat of amalgamation. That is in spite of its being the only remaining Welsh armoured regiment. If these decisions are made, on the order of precedence under the Ironside/Levy rules, both the Queen&#8217;s Dragoon Guards and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards will be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/6">There are six objective criteria to be met in this regard: recruitment strength, or the number and quality of those who wish to join; regional or national identity; proportionality to all parts of the UK&#8212;we are not looking for favours; the right geographical spread, as the Minister who opened the debate said; capabilities; and operational output. I believe that, on these criteria, the case has been made for maintaining these important and historically significant Welsh regiments.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/7">On Trident, last week the Government announced &#163;1.1 billion of investment in infrastructure that will make the next generation of Trident missiles. Although the main gate decision will not be made until after the next general election, by investing so heavily, they are, in effect, pushing us towards the decision, so that, as with the aircraft carriers, it becomes a fait accompli.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/8">This has been done without a proper discussion or a debate on the Floor of the House. Opponents of Trident object for a variety of reasons: some because they are pacifists, others because they do not believe that it represents good value for money or a meaningful deterrent. Large numbers of young men and women are being made redundant from the conventional armed forces over the coming years, and regiments will be lost, but there is enough money for these weapons.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/9">However, in Wales Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones, apparently wants these nuclear weapons based near the major international trade port that deals with 30% of UK gas and 25% of UK oil and petrol. The oil refinery was the reason why Polaris was not sited at Milford Haven in 1963, and it is unclear why a busier location would be considered today. According to Chalmers and Walker in 2002,</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/10">&#8220;it remains the case that refineries would have to close if submarines were relocated there.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.260.0/11">Therefore, this man is arguing for Trident to come to Wales, for weapons of mass destruction to be sited on Welsh soil and for there to be a net loss of jobs for Wales&#8212;not, I think, a very good deal.</p>

	<p pid="c.262.0/1">It is a great honour to contribute to this debate. I begin by paying tribute to all members of the armed forces for the fantastic work they do. I attended the trooping of the colour and I noted that many had recently returned from the line of fire and were still performing absolutely magnificently. That is emblematic of our armed forces, and we should always remember them and salute them for that.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/2">I want to make a general point about returning soldiers from Germany, because clearly that is happening; in my constituency there are several who are in need of support from organisations such as Family Lives. It is important to recognise that such major transitions do take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/3">On the black hole that we were discussing previously, I want to make clear what I think a black hole is: a great expenditure commitment over a long period for which there is no money. That was the situation under the last Labour Government, and there definitely was a &#163;38 billion black hole. It has now effectively been filled in and concreted over by our Government, but a black hole is what I have just said it is.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/4">The motion also refers to the possibility of changing the assumptions on which the strategic defence and security review are based. In fact, many of the assumptions the Government made two years ago were absolutely right and stand the test of time; but obviously, there are nuances that one must bear in mind and adjustments one must make.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/5">The interesting move that the United States has made in refocusing its efforts towards the Pacific and Asia is a fascinating one that we as a country should be mindful of in having a flexible approach to our naval forces. I noted that, while dealing with Libya, we did not actually need an aircraft carrier. Because we had sensible relationships with allies, we were able to accomplish quite magnificent feats with our fixed-wing aircraft. We have to remember that the advantage of having good allies&#8212;an assumption that we made as part of the SDSR process&#8212;is absolutely critical.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/6">We should also celebrate the Government&#8217;s creation of a National Security Council, which brings together foreign affairs, international development and defence. Without an appreciation of our foreign affairs objectives, we will not be very successful at putting together a defence strategy. This Government have understood the direct and obvious link between those areas, which is why we are so much better at calibrating, assessing and understanding our defence needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/7">Clearly, we need hardware, and one good thing we are introducing is heavy-lift capacity, which we do need. It is great that Airbus, in the form of the A400M, is part of that package&#8212;an aircraft that is doing extraordinarily well elsewhere. The quality of our surface fleet is also an important issue&#8212;new frigates and destroyers that are up to the necessary standard for the tasks that we have.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.0/8">On aircraft carriers, it was absolutely right to look at what is happening with the new Gerald R. Ford-class carrier in the United States, which has the electronic &#8220;cat and trap&#8221; system. It must have been tantalising for us to consider, certainly given our relationship with the French and their one aircraft carrier, which is also cat and trap. We did not go down that route, but it was sensible to consider it, because we have to make the right decisions in the long run.</p>

	<p pid="c.263.0/1">I wish to start by talking about the young men and women who serve in our front-line services. I pay tribute to all members of the armed services, be they in the back room or on the front line, but special consideration has to be given to those on the front line, such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq. I went to Afghanistan in 2007 and met some of the young men who were fighting for us. They were 18, 19, 20, and they were being faced by and had to see all sorts of cruelties. They had to face so much hurt and they had to see so many injuries among their comrades. When they come back, we need to look after their physical and psychological needs. That means that if they have been injured in combat, all the best treatment should be made available to them. Even if they have not suffered any physical harm, they must be treated in respect of their emotional and psychological needs as well. They must be supported appropriately when they leave the Army and come into civilian life. That means that if they want to go to university, they should be given free tuition. Although we rightly always pay respect to our fallen heroes, we forget that what people are exposed to in war and in battles is an experience that nobody else is ever going to see and hear. So we should spend a lot more money on looking after our armed personnel who have served on the front line when they come back.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.0/2">It is also important to equip these people properly when they are on the front line. They should be properly trained, and the armour, the helicopters and everything else that is required for them to do their job properly should be in place. That also means that the right amount of personnel should be there; 100 people should not be sent to do a job that requires 300 soldiers to do it. That means that the Government should reconsider the abandoning of certain regiments. The fighting force, the infantry and the regiments that go out to fight should not be reduced. One of my constituents who served in the Yorkshire Regiment, which was founded by the Duke of Wellington, says that it is one of the best regiments and has received many Victoria Crosses for the services it has rendered to the country, so I ask Ministers to reconsider reducing the number of soldiers on the front line.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.0/3">We are told that some of these re-evaluations of our defence expenditure are to do with the money. I want the Minister, and indeed Labour Members, to consider whether we really need Trident. I know that people think that this is a debate of the left, but everyone knows that four years ago a number of generals and senior people in the Army and the Air Force said that Trident is actually irrelevant and is no longer required, as a result of the end of the cold war. They have also said that it is not ready to deal with the current levels of international terrorism. The generals set that out in a letter to <i>The Times</i> in January 2009. I have copies of the documents where they have asked that more money be spent on conventional forces, which we require to deal with the imminent threats we face. As I said, those people are not pacifists and they are not people who do not know what they are talking about; they are&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.264.0/1">Thank you very much for calling me in this debate, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/2">I agree with the comments that my hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces made about how important this weekend is going to be, as it is national armed forces weekend. Not unnaturally, I am delighted to have this opportunity, because my constituency of Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, more affectionately known as &#8220;Guz&#8221;, is going to be the national focus for the armed forces weekend. Plymouth is the home of 3 Commando Brigade, the Royal Marines and flag officer sea training, and it has an enormously big heritage, of which we are incredibly proud. I pay tribute to Commander Crichton for all his hard work in putting together the national armed forces weekend.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/3">During this debate we have heard a great deal about how we need to make an assessment of where we are going. In my submission to the strategic defence and security review, I made it clear that Britain is a maritime nation, and we need to protect our sea routes. That means that we have to ensure that we are not sea blind. The Royal Navy&#8217;s role is to ensure not only soft diplomacy but that we can engage as and when Parliament decides where to go. It is a tool of foreign policy; indeed, some people would say that it could be a provisional tool in foreign policy, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/4">I welcome the building of the aircraft carriers, but we need to ensure that when we move on to the next tranche of the SDSR we look long and hard at how to ensure that the supporting frigates are included.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/5">Plymouth has a good story to tell about its harbour, which is the finest natural harbour in the world. It sits on the western approaches and is the one place in the United Kingdom that can deliver the refuelling and refitting of our nuclear submarines. That is our stake in the ground. I believe it is important that we retain our nuclear deterrent, because it is important not only strategically for our country but for my local economy, as 25,000 people are dependent on the defence industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/6">Our dockyard was consistently under threat for the time that the Labour party was in power and I am delighted by the hard work my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench have been able to do in government to ensure that we can secure its future. The Government have been successful in ensuring not only that we will retain our Type 23s but that the &#163;350 million refit of HMS Vengeance will take place in Devonport. The Government have been rebuilding confidence in Plymouth and Devonport, ensuring that we can do the very important job of engineering research, too, and making us one of the global leaders in maritime activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/7">I am surprised by the Labour party&#8217;s approach and ask them to reconsider it. We need to ensure that those involved in our armed services have support in education, that they have decent housing and that they have provision to deal with mental health issues. We must work hard on that. This has been an important debate and we must ensure that we continue with the armed services covenant. I will welcome the opportunity to listen to the next debate on the subject, which will be important.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.0/1">Britain has a proud military history and throughout that history, sailors, soldiers and airmen served our country with a courage and bravery that has become synonymous with the British armed forces. It is a pleasure to place on the record tonight my appreciation for our armed forces, as I will when I attend a ceremony in Liverpool town hall on Saturday. I will be remembering the eight brave men from Liverpool who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, but of course the deaths of those brave men do not tell the full story. Countless others from the Merseyside area have been killed or injured in the line of duty during other conflicts and it should be recognised that Liverpool produces more men and women in our armed forces per capita than probably any other area of the country. As people will know, the Mersey is the lifeblood of our great city and Liverpool has a long history with the Royal Navy and the merchant navy. Its maritime history is a reminder to us all of the sacrifices and bravery of our ancestors.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.0/2">In the somewhat limited time I have left, I want to talk about the lack of consideration that this Government have recently shown to our armed forces. I am primarily referring to the widespread reports that the Defence Secretary is to make soldiers who are currently serving redundant on their return from their tour of duty. What kind of Government would do that to their own brave soldiers? Decisions taken today, matters of life or death, spending commitments and diplomatic negotiations can and invariably will have ramifications for generations to come. What is more, some of the policy decisions made by the Defence Secretary today are likely to take decades to become manifest.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.0/3">Yes, we need reform&#8212;that is why my right hon. Friend the shadow Defence Secretary outlined &#163;5 billion-worth of reforms recently&#8212;but a reduction in Britain&#8217;s capability based on opinion polls is irresponsible. Controversy is not an excuse for carelessness or, dare I say, callousness.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.0/4">The Defence Secretary should not underestimate the part that morale plays when it comes to our soldiers and armed forces. He would do well to remember the words of Dwight D. Eisenhower:</p>
	<p pid="c.265.0/5">&#8220;The best morale exists when you never hear the word mentioned. When you hear a lot of talk about it, it&#8217;s usually lousy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.265.0/6">Our armed forces deserve a Defence Secretary who understands defence and does not use it for political expedience. Our British armed forces deserve a Secretary of State who demonstrates compassion for the mission, empathy for the families and a determination to stand up for defence in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.1/1">It has been a pleasure to listen to this evening&#8217;s debate on defence reform, in which hon. Members have spoken on a number of topics. Let me say at the outset that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40438" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> posed some very pertinent questions to Government Front Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.1/2">I am pleased that we are having this debate in the week before armed forces day because it gives us the opportunity to pause and reflect on the bravery of our forces and the sacrifices they make, as has been mentioned</p>
	<p pid="c.265.1/3">by my hon. Friends the Members for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi) and for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram) among others. Our forces do what is asked of them without question or hesitation and they often place their lives on the line to protect others. I am sure that the national event taking place in Plymouth this Saturday will be a great success. In West Dunbartonshire we celebrated armed forces day on Sunday past with a march-past in Dumbarton high street and a service in Riverside parish church.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.1/4">There is no doubt that the armed forces will face challenges in the coming years, not least as part of the new employment model and the Future Force 2020 plan. Some 30,000 troops will have been removed by 2020. That will have an enormous impact on the UK&#8217;s capability, and clarity from Ministers on the decisions they have taken about future capability would be welcome. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> made some excellent points about our maritime capability.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.1/5">Recent reports have raised concerns that certain regiments are at risk of being scrapped. Belonging to a regiment is a very strong part of many soldiers&#8217; identity. That is why the shadow Secretary of State launched our &#8220;Respect Our Regiments&#8221; campaign last month. I know that many Members are concerned about regiments and battalions being scrapped, including colleagues from Wales, Yorkshire, Scotland and Staffordshire. I apologise if I have missed anyone out. The Government intend to rely much more heavily on reservists in future, and the Minister knows I am concerned that he and the Government plan to scrap employment protections for reservists while asking for more from them.</p>

	<p pid="c.266.1/1">The Minister shakes his head but I raised this with him last year and again last week. I know he is going to write to me and I await that letter because our understanding of the situation differs.</p>
	<p pid="c.266.1/2">Last year, we reached agreement across the House on the armed forces covenant. I will resist the temptation raised by the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the hon. Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase>. As he knows and as the record shows, his party and the Minister had to be dragged kicking and screaming into putting the provisions we now have in law into the Armed Forces Act 2011. Anyone can read the record of the Committee proceedings to see that that is correct. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s recollection was frankly a little wobbly. The Minister knows that I do not think the armed forces covenant is yet being taken seriously enough across all of government and the public sector in accordance with the principles set down. I do not doubt his commitment but more work needs to be done to make sure that it is a reality and that it works in practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.266.1/3">I want to raise the issue of discrimination towards our forces. This concern is highlighted in the recent report by Lord Ashcroft, &#8220;The Armed Forces and Society&#8221;, which states that one in five members of the forces reports have been refused service in a bar or hotel while wearing their uniform and that around the same number reports being verbally abused while wearing their uniform. That is clearly unacceptable discrimination and if we take the covenant seriously we should be looking at how to tackle such behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.267.1/1">I am afraid that I really do not think I have time, but if I have time later I will.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.1/2">The service community can face indirect discrimination, creating difficulty with day-to-day matters that we take for granted such as getting credit, mortgages or even a mobile phone contract because they have moved around so often. We should not accept that as inevitable. The principles of the armed forces covenant should apply throughout society, and where those principles are routinely or blatantly breached, it may be necessary to consider introducing measures to deal with the matter. Routine disadvantage or discrimination should never go hand in hand with serving one&#8217;s country.</p>

	<p pid="c.267.3/1">Great strides were made under the previous Government through the Green Paper and the service personnel Command Paper, which set up the provisions we now have.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/2">Legal protections are in place for other groups in society and we believe that consideration should be given to whether they should be extended to our armed forces. I thought the Minister agreed to cross-party talks in our Westminster Hall debate last week, but that does not appear to be what is on the record. I hope that he is willing to take part in such talks and I would welcome confirmation of that today.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/3">When referring to the wider service community, we must of course mention forces&#8217; families. They put up with an awful lot and we do not do enough for them. We have to make many improvements, particularly in housing, on which the hon. Member for Tamworth made some welcome comments. The Minister has side-stepped concerns about the missing &#163;41 million for forces&#8217; housing, so I urge him to take cognisance of today&#8217;s report from the Select Committee on Defence, which sets out the concerns about housing very well. In last week&#8217;s Westminster Hall debate, I urged him to think carefully before making any changes to the rules on service accommodation. As he knows, leaked plans to change the entitlement to married quarters were not well received earlier this year. Perhaps he will tell us tonight whether those changes are still being considered.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/4">Our motion makes specific reference to pensions. There are concerns that some individuals have been made redundant with only a few weeks to go before being entitled to a full pension. It has been suggested that that was done deliberately to cut cost. The Minister has the opportunity to say today that that is not the case and that getting rid of people from the forces before they qualified for a full pension was not a deliberate policy. Will he also comment on media reports last week that the Government may be considering raising by five years the age at which forces personnel can receive a full pension?</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/5">Many Members, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase>, have highlighted the importance of the defence industry in the UK. That includes a range of industries&#8212;shipbuilding,</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/6">manufacturing, maintenance, aerospace, technical support, clothing and optics. Let me say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase>, who raised some specific issues, that reports about Portsmouth dockyard have appeared in the media and the shadow Defence team has responded to those reports. I assure her that we share her concerns and we are on the side of her constituents and the people of Portsmouth. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase> made some excellent points about defence procurement and in particular about the successor deterrent programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> asked us to explain some of the savings that we have identified. He will be pleased to hear that details of a full &#163;5 billion have been published on <i>The Guardian</i> website, if nowhere else, and I refer him to that site.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/8">I want to say a little about defence in Scotland. This week saw the launch of the &#8220;Better Together&#8221; campaign&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s cross-party campaign making the positive case for staying part of the UK. It is a shame that the nationalist spokesperson for defence has chosen not to be present tonight. For more than 300 years, service men and women from Scotland have served alongside their countrymen and women from the rest of the UK, with a shared identity and goal&#8212;protecting the people of the UK and defending those unable to defend themselves around the world. The defence sector is extremely important across the whole of Scotland, supporting around 50,000 jobs and in the west of Scotland pumping about &#163;270 million a year into the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.3/9">On the &#8220;Better Together&#8221; website, Members can hear Craig and Tanya, both from Dumbarton, and Robert from Cumbernauld, who all work in the shipyards on the Clyde, talking about why they want to stay part of the UK. If any Members are in any doubt about the importance of MOD contracts to the people of Scotland, I suggest they listen to those whose jobs depend on them. Although breaking Scotland off from the UK is a reform too far for me and for the majority of Scots, we have had a good debate this evening on many aspects of defence reform.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.268.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" speakername="Andrew Robathan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="268"  time="021:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0004.htm#1206271000732">
	<p pid="c.268.0/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" name="Gemma Doyle">the hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)</phrase> in rejecting any idea that Scotland would be better off independent, and how much stronger we are&#8212;both Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole&#8212;as a Union?</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/2">Many of the contributions to the debate today show how wide and how deep the admiration and respect for our armed forces runs in the House, and that reflects the feelings across the country. We should not forget that the purpose of our armed forces is to succeed on operations, to protect our national security and to provide the ultimate guarantee of our country&#8217;s security and independence, as well as helping to project its values and interests abroad. In Afghanistan today, that is what our soldiers are doing, risking life and limb to keep us safe as we sit in comfort in Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/3">Operations remain the No. 1 priority for the Ministry of Defence and we will do everything we can to achieve success not just in Afghanistan, but in standing operations</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/4">around the world and in helping to deliver a safe and secure Olympics this summer. But to make sure that this success continues into the future, we have to make sure that our services are structured properly, that the equipment programme is funded and that the needs of our forces are looked after.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/5">That is why the programme of implementing the SDSR is so necessary&#8212;putting the years of Labour mismanagement behind and sorting out the mess. Although it appears that the Opposition recognise the need for change, they still do not appear to understand why there is such a need for change. The shadow Secretary of State for Defence&#8212;I am sorry he is not here&#8212;has written:</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/6">&#8220;In beginning to develop future policy we have to be honest about the past.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/7">Today, not one Member on the Opposition Benches has been honest about the mistakes that the Opposition made in the past. Not one has said sorry&#8212;sorry for 12 years without a defence review, sorry for the &#163;38 billion black hole in the budget&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> should stop digging. He has been digging quite enough today. Not one Opposition Member has said sorry for ducking the tough choice required to put our armed forces back on track.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.0/8">I am afraid that in the limited time available I will not be able to address all the contributions to the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40438" name="Menzies Campbell">The right hon. and learned Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> yet again made an impassioned case for RAF Leuchars. It remains our intention that the Army move to Leuchars and the RAF move to Lossiemouth. He asked some very detailed questions. Will he please take those up and I will make sure that my excellent civil servants in the Box bring them to the attention of the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40399" name="Peter Luff">the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, who would be better at answering than I would be this evening?</p>

	<p pid="c.269.1/1">In which case I do not think my hon. Friend the Minister will be writing to the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> made a point about the Nimrod MRA4. It was a procurement disaster. The aircraft were never in service and never flew in service. I say to the hon. Lady and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40218" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd)</phrase> that the Government value the Welsh regiments that she spoke about. I have Welsh antecedents. I had a great uncle killed in Gallipoli in the Welsh Regiment and other relatives in the Welsh regiments, so I can assure her that we value the Welsh regiments. I do not know what is in the report. We must wait until General Carter&#8217;s report is published, which it will be, shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase> drew attention to misleading statements on the naval base that she attributed to the Labour press office. If that is the case, it is regrettable. We have no intention whatsoever of closing the Portsmouth naval base.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">The hon. Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> raised an important point about audit, accountability and the need for the reform of NATO. I suggest that he takes that up&#8212;I am looking again at my excellent civil servants&#8212;with the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Mr Howarth)</phrase>, who is responsible for such matters, and I am sure that he will get back to him on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/5">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> for his sensible look at defence strategy and the future of the reserves. I am sure that we are looking forward to seeing him in uniform tomorrow as a serving officer. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> was keen to encourage the defence industry and exports. Three Defence Ministers spend their time going around areas trying to encourage defence exports. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was widely criticised, including by Labour Front-Bench spokesmen, when he tried to encourage exports to the middle east. I am very glad to have the hon. Lady&#8217;s support. She referred to the economic difficulties that the Government have got themselves into since 2010. I do not think so. I really do not think so.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase> made a good point about housing. We are working on banks and mortgages, as he asked, and BFPO addresses will now be accepted as proper addresses for security. I am very much looking forward to seeing my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40481" name="Oliver Colvile">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver Colvile)</phrase> on armed forces day in Plymouth this weekend.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/7">I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase> that we are not making reductions in the armed forces out of callousness, but with huge regret, and it is painful to us. We are doing it because of the appalling financial situation that the Government received when they took office in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" name="Gemma Doyle">The hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)</phrase> is not correct that there is any intention to reduce protection for employment of reservists deployed. I am delighted to hear her praying in aid again my noble Friend Lord Ashcroft. I have never heard praise from the Labour Benches for Lord Ashcroft before, but I am pleased to hear it now. Perhaps she will bring forward an analysis of discrimination. I draw her attention to a letter that has been sent to the shadow Defence Secretary from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, which says:</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/9">&#8220;I welcome the work conducted by Lord Ashcroft&#8230;I was reassured that that public support for our Armed Forces remains &#8216;very high&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/10">He particularly says:</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/11">&#8220;I would welcome a discussion with you on how we can ensure that everything we do in Parliament emphasises our cross-party support for the Armed Forces and the people who serve in them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/12">The Opposition probably rather regret calling this debate today. They have made themselves look somewhat foolish. While I remember, may I say how sorry I am to hear about the shadow Secretary of State&#8217;s relation in Australia? I understand that he is very ill and we wish him the very best in that illness, and I mean that sincerely. However, having been nice to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, let me say that he admitted that Labour was planning savings in restructuring the Army and then attacked us for doing just that. The Opposition remain in denial. They seem to say that everything was</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/13">great in defence at the general election. It was not. As the shadow Secretary of State has identified, the Opposition&#8217;s greatest weakness remains the black hole that they left us. Today, the team has been revealed in all its glory. The Opposition have shown that they have no real defence policy. They have no answers to the problems in defence. They have no acceptance of the difficult position that we are in and no acceptance of the mess made by the Labour Government of the Government finances and of the defence budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/14">In conclusion&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.276.10/1">Private tenants on low incomes in York face a particular problem because their housing benefit is based not on rents in York, but on rents in a broad market rental area that includes towns and villages 20 miles from York, where rents are much lower.

	<p pid="c.276.10/3">The Petition of residents of York,</p>
	<p pid="c.276.10/4">Declares that York is facing a housing crisis, with homelessness in York in 2010/2011 40% up on the previous year; further declares that the Government&#8217;s reforms to Housing Benefits mean that of 6,299 private rented properties previously affordable in the city, 3,700 will be lost, a reduction of almost 50%; declares that this is effectively driving people out of York and away from their jobs, families and friends; and declares that York&#8217;s Broad Market Rental Area, which determines the level of Housing Benefit currently available, should be based on the York Unitary Authority area and not on neighbouring towns including, Tadcaster, Selby, and Pocklington, all of which have lower rents than York, in order to reduce the pressure on people to move away from the city which is their home.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.10/5">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to make changes to the boundary of the York Broad Market Rental Area to include only the York Unitary Authority area.</p>

	<p pid="c.278.2/1">I feel a mixture of pride and anxiety speaking about Nottingham&#8217;s decent homes programme. I am proud of the difference it has made to the lives of my constituents, but anxious for the future, because the final two years of investment have yet to be confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/2">I want to explain my pride that, thanks to a unique study produced through the knowledge transfer partnership between Nottingham City Homes and Nottingham business school, we can measure the impact of Nottingham&#8217;s decent homes programme. I shall also set out exactly what is at stake for my constituents, including tenants, their neighbours and the wider city of Nottingham. If the promised funding is not delivered, the objective of bringing all council homes in Nottingham up to a decent standard is at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/3">Twelve years ago, the Labour Government set out their vision in a housing Green Paper and made a commitment to tackle chronic under-investment and to bring all housing up to an acceptable standard. In 2010, the National Audit Office found that, although the decent homes programme had probably had a wider beneficial impact, a lack</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/4">&#8220;of data on these wider benefits means that it is not possible to identify the Programme&#8217;s true impact throughout its life.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/5">The impact study helps to prove what MPs knew: that the programme was making a difference on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/6">In January 2011, the House debated &#8220;Beyond Decent Homes&#8221;, a report from the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government. MPs on both sides of the House, including me, described what good-quality housing meant for their constituents. NCH was awarded funding by the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2008 and work began to complete &#163;187 million-worth of planned investment to tackle the 32% of council homes in Nottingham classified as non-decent. The work was carried out under three streams to maximise efficiency and match tenants&#8217; priorities. The secure stream was to replace all single-glazed windows with secured-by-design double-glazed units and replace any old or damaged doors; the warm stream was to improve heating and insulation; and the modern stream was to make internal improvements, including replacing outdated kitchens and bathrooms. Adaptations to meet the special needs of some tenants, including level-access showers or wet rooms, would also be undertaken alongside the secure, warm and modern&#8212;SWM&#8212;programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/7">When the 2010 general election brought new uncertainty, tenants and leaseholders launched their &#8220;Nott Decent&#8221; campaign, and I was proud to join them in presenting a petition to No. 10 to ask the new Government to honour the commitment that had been made to them. We were pleased and relieved when the Minister re-allocated funding&#8212;albeit reduced funding over a longer period&#8212;to complete the programme. By January 2012, 15,900 properties&#8212;more than half of all council homes&#8212;had new windows; 3,400 doors had been replaced; 10,200 heating systems had been upgraded; 2,900 lofts were properly insulated; 9,000 kitchens and 7,200 bathrooms</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/8">had been replaced; and 284 aids and adaptations had been made to make properties more accessible for their disabled tenants.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/9">The impact study measured the effect of those changes to tenants&#8217; homes. On crime and security, the results are dramatic: burglary fell by 42% between 2007 and 2010 on two sample estates where single-glazed windows were replaced, compared with a 21% reduction across the city. The study identified that timber doors were a weak spot in houses&#8217; overall security, which provided evidence to support replacing all external doors, not just those that were especially old or damaged. Tenants reported feeling safer in their homes&#8212;an important contribution to improved mental health and general well-being.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/10">Together with the installation of energy-efficient central heating systems and loft insulation, the new windows have raised the average energy efficiency rating of NCH homes from 60 to 68 points. That represents a 15% decrease in carbon emissions from NCH properties, which is equivalent to taking 2,700 cars off the road or planting 360,000 trees and growing them for 10 years. By the time the SWM programme is completed in 2015, energy efficiency from NCH homes will be saving 43,500 tonnes of carbon per year and achieving 17% of the city&#8217;s target for carbon reduction from domestic properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/11">Of course, not only are energy-efficient and better-insulated homes good for the environment; they have a real and immediate benefit to the people who live in them. Tenants not only report that their homes are warmer, suffer less damp and condensation and give them pride in their neighbourhood, but that they are saving money&#8212;and given that an estimated 12% of all city residents were in fuel poverty before the programme began, that is money they desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/12">The Energy Saving Trust estimates that new windows alone can save &#163;95 to &#163;223 a year, and new boilers up to &#163;225 a year. In total, improved homes are saving Nottingham tenants &#163;3.5 million each year, making a significant contribution to reducing fuel poverty, which fell to 6.8% of city residents by 2010-11&#8212;after the programme upgraded thousands of properties. The improvements also enable tenants to get rid of extra appliances such as old electric heaters, which can often present a health and safety hazard. Combined with better security, these changes to the physical fabric of their homes have a marked effect on the health and well-being of NCH tenants.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/13">The impact study estimates that, as a result of the SWM programme, two lives a year are saved by protecting vulnerable tenants from the cold; that the respiratory health of 1,000 children is improved; that, every year, 12 hospital admissions resulting from falls are avoided; that 144 accidents requiring medical attention are prevented; and that, as a result of providing warmer homes and reduced fuel bills, more than 1,400 tenants have better mental health. Based on just those examples, where a measurable change and cost impact for the NHS in Nottingham could be calculated, the savings are almost &#163;700,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/14">In a time of economic austerity and public sector spending cuts, the benefits accruing from public capital investment matter more than ever. Nottingham, along with the rest of the country, is feeling the devastating impact of a double-dip recession: 19,000 people are out of work and there are six jobseekers for every vacancy.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/15">Construction, the fifth largest employment sector in the city, has been badly hit by the economic downturn and reduction in house building. The decent homes programme is providing vital work, and of the 560 people currently delivering SWM in Nottingham, about one third live in the city and over half in Nottinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/16">Investment in decent homes is not only providing much-needed jobs for joiners, plumbers, and other workers in the construction industry; the analysis shows that every &#163;1 of investment in the programme generates &#163;1.36 in Nottingham city or &#163;1.46 in Nottinghamshire as a whole, which means that the &#163;37.6 million spent on the decent homes programme in 2010-11 generated an extra &#163;17.3 million of additional spending in Nottinghamshire, &#163;13.5 million of which came into the city.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/17">The SWM programme also makes an important contribution to training and skills development through the &#8220;One in a Million&#8221; scheme, which requires contractors to take on an apprentice for every &#163;1 million of their contract. That has already created 105 apprenticeships, with a target of creating a total of 200 by 2015. In addition, staff on the SWM team have completed 2,000 hours of training, including externally accredited qualifications. As a result of this investment in skills, these staff can expect to earn an extra &#163;13 million in additional lifetime earnings.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/18">The impact study shows that investment in decent housing works both for tenants and the wider community. However, the benefits accruing from decent homes are not secure. The funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government for the decent homes programme remains indicative for the final two years of Nottingham&#8217;s programme. In the reallocation of funding in January 2011, 53% of NCH&#8217;s allocation was weighted towards those two final years, amounting to a total of &#163;45.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/19">If that investment does not go ahead, the consequences for our city will be dire. For every &#163;1 million spent, 21 jobs are created, so cutting the funding could result in more than 950 job losses over the two years. Furthermore, NCH is committed to taking on an apprentice for every &#163;1 million spent, so the reduction in funding would result in 45 fewer local people starting apprenticeships. If remaining heating upgrades are not completed, savings of 2,440 tonnes of carbon and &#163;600,000 from tenants&#8217; fuel bills will no longer be made, and a cut in funding would mean the loss not only of the original investment of &#163;45 million into the construction industry, but of an additional &#163;21 million of re-spending in the local economy. Most importantly, of course, if the funding is not confirmed, 7,000 tenants and their families would be left living in substandard housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/20">The loss of the investment would hit some harder than others, and one neighbourhood in Nottingham that stands to lose most is the Meadows in my constituency. Before the last election, the Meadows, one of the 5% most deprived wards in the country, was due to benefit from &#163;200 million of new investment, which would have transformed the area. The incoming coalition Government cancelled the housing PFI scheme, and I raised my concerns about that decision back in December 2010. Subsequently, together with representatives of the local community and the council&#8217;s regeneration team, I met the Minister for Housing and Local Government to discuss the impact of his decision, and he agreed to visit</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/21">the Meadows to see for himself the needs of our neighbourhood. Unfortunately, he has not found time in his diary to make good on that commitment, so I would like to use this opportunity to reissue that invitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/22">Nottingham City Homes was forced to reallocate funding within its decent homes budget so that Meadows residents were not left behind&#8212;to ensure that, having been let down by the new Government, they would still get their new doors and windows, boilers and insulation, kitchens and bathrooms, even though their hopes of transforming their neighbourhood were dashed. Thanks to the hard work of the SWM team, every NCH property in the Meadows has new windows, a third of the homes have better heating and insulation, and NCH hopes to complete the other two thirds before the end of this financial year. Those promised doors, kitchens and bathrooms, however, rely on those last two years of funding. The Minister really should come to Nottingham and meet some of those families in my constituency so that he can understand what his decision will mean to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/23">I also want to touch on the wider impacts. A cut to this funding would also have knock-on effects on NCH&#8217;s self-financing position under the housing revenue account, and on other investment programmes that need to be match funded by investment from the decent homes programme. Nottingham City Homes and Nottingham city council are currently making proactive use of the community energy saving programme started by the last Labour Government to insulate hard-to-heat properties in our most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/24">Although it was right to focus resources, individual low-income householders in more affluent areas also face fuel poverty. These are often social housing tenants, and social landlords such as NCH have a strong track record of working with utility companies to help stop such homes leaking heat, making a huge contribution to the country&#8217;s carbon reduction obligations. Social housing providers need the maximum ability to retrofit their homes under the new green deal with its associated new energy company obligation arrangements. This will include the ability to match fund ECO money with housing investment programmes to get better value in tackling excess cold, helping reduce fuel poverty and reducing carbon emissions from domestic properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/25">I hope the Minister will address the following questions in his response. In 2008, a third of Nottingham&#8217;s council housing failed to meet the decent homes standard, but if funding is confirmed, all council homes will meet it by 2015. Can he confirm that the &#163;45.6 million of indicative funding for Nottingham City Homes for the last two years of the decent homes programme will be forthcoming? If he cannot provide that assurance tonight, can he tell us when housing providers will know, so that they can plan work, keep contractors on schedule and avoid the waste of winding down programmes only to have to start them up again? Can he explain how the Government will ensure that social housing tenants benefit from the green deal and ECO work to improve hard-to-heat homes and to tackle fuel poverty?</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/26">The Minister has said outside this House today that Nottingham receives substantial housing funding. The truth is that, as a deprived city that suffered from a lack of investment during the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, this funding is</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/27">needed. The impact study proves that the money has been well spent. Our homes should be the places where we can shut out the world and feel safe, but if our home is cold, damp, overcrowded and outdated, there is no escape.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/28">Decent housing matters; investment in good council housing changes lives. This study shows that investing in social housing delivers real, tangible benefits to whole communities, including jobs and growth. Surely the Government will not turn its back on this chance to do the right thing. Good council houses are not just bricks and mortar; they are homes to my constituents, who are entitled to a decent standard of living. I hope that the Minister will confirm the funding and enable Nottingham City Homes to finish this essential work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-06-26c.282.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="282"  time="022:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120626/debtext/120626-0004.htm#1206271001257">
	<p pid="c.282.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40462" name="Lilian Greenwood">the hon. Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood)</phrase> on her speech, and on securing the debate. She spoke with great eloquence, and presented a very thorough picture of the circumstances in Nottingham and the value of the decent homes programme. I am very much on the same page as her, given the improvements that the programme can make to the health and well-being and security of tenants, and the impact that improvements in the insulation and energy performance of homes can have on carbon reduction. I also know that Nottingham has an excellent record of tackling climate change at local level.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/2">I think that, before dealing with the intricacies of the situation in Nottingham, I should say something about the decent homes programme in general. The Government believe that all social housing should meet the decent homes standard, which, according to the technical wording of the definition, means that it should be free of category 1 hazards, should be in a reasonable state of repair, should have reasonably modern facilities and services, and should provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/3">I must tell the hon. Lady that the present Government inherited not only a decent homes programme, but a huge deficit and a &#163;3.2 billion backlog in capital investment in housing. The Government have already announced plans to invest &#163;2.1 billion in the completion of the decent homes programme, of which &#163;1.6 billion will be allocated to 46 local authorities&#8212;including Nottingham&#8212;and &#163;500 million will go to registered social landlords in the form of gap funding. Those funds will make &#163;127,000 council homes decent by the end of 2014-15, which will cover nearly 60% of the council housing that remains non-decent. The final slice of those non-decent homes will be made decent by local authorities using their own resources, and, as the hon. Lady said, Nottingham will be able to do that.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/4">We have already been very successful in reducing the number of homes that are not fit for people to live in. In April 2010, shortly before the general election, local authorities had 291,600 non-decent dwellings. By April 2011 the number had fallen by 26%, to 217,000. Figures for the past year are being collated, and the Homes and Communities Agency predicts that we will prove to have reduced the number by about a further 20,000 during that period. As the hon. Lady said, more is being done even as we speak.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/5">We believe that our funding&#8212;together with the introduction of self-financing for housing authorities and the increases in allowances that that brings them&#8212;will give local authorities the means to deal with any newly arising non-decent stock from within their own resources. In other words, they have the finances with which to maintain a steady state once we have achieved a high standard of decency.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/6">Let me now deal with the position in Nottingham. Nottingham City Homes is a strongly performing arm&#8217;s length management organisation. Incidentally, my area of Stockport contains an ALMO which also performs very well. Only last year, Nottingham city council extended its agreement with Nottingham City Homes for a further 10 years, which I think constitutes a very good vote of confidence. That ALMO has been able to demonstrate an increase in tenant satisfaction; it has reduced rent arrears from &#163;5 million to &#163;1.8 million; and it was given a two-star rating under the old regime which unlocked its original decent homes funding programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/7">When the time came for us to allocate funding to Nottingham, we recognised that the city had a significant backlog of non-decent homes&#8212;the hon. Lady has given the figures on that. That is why we allocated &#163;86 million in indicative funding with the first two years confirmed&#8212;&#163;40.5 million committed in the first two years. That is the largest award to any council outside London, and the Homes and Communities Agency is putting &#163;78 million of additional investment into new housing and regeneration across Greater Nottingham by 2015, to produce 536 new homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/8">As the hon. Lady said, the impact of the decent homes funding has been substantial. It has produced a big improvement in many people&#8217;s lives, not just in better homes, but in all that flows from that. The hon. Lady eloquently explained some of those benefits, and I entirely agree that this programme has brought, and can continue to bring, real benefits to tenants in Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/9">The hon. Lady referred to the study, undertaken by Nottingham City Homes with Nottingham Trent university, of the wider impact of decent homes. That study has made a very useful contribution to our knowledge, and ought to be required reading for those who doubt the importance of investing in our social housing stock. It shows why the coalition Government were right to fund authorities to make homes decent. As the hon. Lady said, every &#163;1 million spent has created 21 jobs in Nottingham. The study gives a series of impressive statistics about the benefits that have been secured, not least reductions in crime. There are health benefits as well, of course, but some of those listed are, perhaps, a little tenuous; reductions in falls is one thing, but improvements in the respiratory health of children and in the mental health of tenants are more clear-cut.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/10">We have already confirmed almost half the allocation we set out in the comprehensive spending review. I know that Nottingham and others are keen to get certainty on their budgets for April 2013 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/11">The hon. Lady was, perhaps, wearing rose-tinted spectacles when she spoke of the performance of the previous Government. The Labour Government cut the decent homes programme by &#163;150 million in July 2009, cannibalising one part of the housing programme to pay for new housing policies elsewhere. They also failed to meet their decent homes target. They pledged in 2000</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/12">that they would ensure that all social housing was of a decent standard within 10 years. Sadly, that was not the case by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/13">Labour also made it clear in the general election campaign that they considered investment in housing, and social housing in particular, not to be a top priority. The then Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, told &#8220;Newsnight&#8221;:</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/14">&#8220;Housing is essentially a private sector activity. Let&#8217;s be honest about this...I don&#8217;t see a need for us to continue with such a big renovation programme.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/15">Therefore, although Labour started the programme, it has to be reported that they were throttling it back and were planning to do so more.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/16">When this Government came to power we were borrowing an additional &#163;400 million every day in order to close the gap between what we were spending and what was coming in. It is absolutely right that the Government should keep a tight hold on all their spending. The economic circumstances that have unfolded since show the sense of taking that initial decision and the importance of continuing to keep a tight grip on what we spend and how we spend it. That does include the decent homes programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/17">I can assure the hon. Lady that we are expecting to make an announcement on the decent homes allocation for the final years in due course. I very much take her point that it would be sensible to ensure that the timing of that allowed continuity of contracts and employment. That is a point I will take away from this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/18">I also want to say on behalf of the Minister for Housing and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, that his undertaking to visit the Meadows was given in good faith. He is very busy and very active, and I am happy to confirm that he will in due course visit the Meadows, as he undertook to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/19">I understand the hon. Lady&#8217;s enthusiasm to get ahead, and I share it. The Government are still supportive of all the work that the decent homes programme is doing and all the benefits that it brings. We remain committed to supporting backlog authorities such as Nottingham in making its homes decent, and to supporting some of the most vulnerable in society who live in those homes.</p>
