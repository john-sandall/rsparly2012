That is in part linked to the activities of M23 and other militia. In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about Rwanda, the UN group of experts will report in November.

She will be aware that we produced a report on conflict in the DRC, and we are undertaking one on the situation in Rwanda in the light of budget support being reinstated. Does she accept that the dilemma we face is that Rwanda is a country where development money delivers real results for poor people, but where issues such as freedom of speech and plurality are compromised? That is a dilemma we have to resolve.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right. It is worth remembering that 5 million people are living in poverty in Rwanda. Our programme of support is aimed at helping those people in particular. When we came into government, we attached more conditionality to our general budget support, not least through the partnership principles. It is things such as the partnership principles that I will look at in reaching the decision we will take in December.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.3/1">Is it not worth putting on record the fact that Rwanda has made tremendous strides in the last 15 years since the troubles of the 1990s, in no small part thanks to substantial assistance from the United Kingdom Government? That is something we should absolutely be proud of.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.4/1">I think we should be. In recent years I have spent time in Rwanda, which is a good example of where achieving things on the ground is often complex. Life is not black and white; we have to deal with real people and situations and navigate our way through them to the best of our ability. We know that there are still millions of people in Rwanda living in poverty. The aid programmes we have invested in there have been extremely successful, so there is absolutely a need to continue that work.</p>

Small and medium-sized enterprises&#8212;in fact, all businesses&#8212;are most important. Nigeria&#8212;and, as he mentions, Lagos in particular&#8212;is the growth hub of Africa, as the Prime Minister highlighted when he visited it last year.

	<p pid="c.217.6/1">The humanitarian situation in Syria is deteriorating rapidly: 2.5 million people are already in need and more than 350,000 have fled to neighbouring countries. The UK has already provided &#163;39.5 million of funding for essential food, heating and shelter to help people to cope with the coming winter. I am assessing with other agencies how we can ensure that we are well prepared if the situation deteriorates further, as many people suspect it will.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.8/1">The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Approximately half the support that we provide has been for refugees, and half to help people inside Syria. I have had discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme, the key providers of aid within Syria, and we are working with them to ensure that they can do their job efficiently. Clearly, they are neutral and dispassionate in regard to the politics, and it is vital that we use them.</p>

However, I am working closely with the Foreign Secretary on this matter, and I can assure my hon. Friend that I will bear in mind the point that he has made.</p>

	<p pid="c.218.2/1">I can assure the hon. Gentleman of that. Clearly, if we are to make any progress through the United Nations, it will be critical to get buy-in from those two countries.

	<p pid="c.218.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is shocking to see how what is now the Syrian civil war has affected children in particular. Half of our support has gone to refugees, many of whom are children fleeing with their families. The fact that we have provided trauma support for 28,000 children will give the House a sense of the scale of the problem that we are tackling, and we have announced a further &#163;3 million of support for UNICEF&#8217;s work. We are providing not only counselling but clinical care in places such as Jordan to Syrian refugees who have experienced sexual violence. That is an incredibly worrying aspect of the work that we are doing, but we are absolutely committed to doing what we, as a country, can do with our partners to help that situation.</p>

	<p pid="c.222.5/1">It has been a busy first few weeks in the Department. I have attended the United Nations General Assembly, where I was able to discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria. I have travelled to a World Bank meeting in Tokyo, where I met the Indian Finance Minister, as I have just said. I have taken the opportunity to meet my counterparts at the European Council of Ministers in Luxembourg. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I have introduced new financial controls and instigated a review of consultancy in the Department. I have also managed to visit country programmes in Kenya and Somalia. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="c.223.0/1">I take issue with the hon. Lady&#8217;s assertion that we have not focused on women and children. Doing so is absolutely crucial, and it has been at the heart of everything we have done, not least through the Prime Minister&#8217;s family planning summit, which he held with my predecessor earlier this year. As the hon. Lady will be aware, the millennium development goals focus on areas such as education, women and children, and we are determined to see that continue in the post-2015 goals.</p>

	<p pid="c.223.1/1" qnum="125617">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on being appointed not only to her new post, but as international violence against women champion. Will she demand more action from Governments in areas where there is a high prevalence of female genital mutilation, and give support to the brave local campaigners doing amazing work on the ground to combat such human rights abuse?</p>

	<p pid="c.223.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend, and pay tribute to her for taking such a passionate interest in this issue. Tackling female genital cutting is a priority for me, and there is now a rising desire in Africa to tackle it. Senegal, Burkina Faso, Uganda and the African Union have all indicated that they want to take this forward. We are currently designing an ambitious programme to help end FGC, and supporting civil society organisations working on the ground is likely to be a key component of our work.</p>

	<p pid="c.223.3/1">This week in London the Prime Minister will co-chair the first meeting of the UN high-level panel on post-2015 development goals. In this important week, does the Secretary of State accept that we will end the grotesque inequality that continues to scar our planet only through new, responsible capitalism&#8212;where ethics and profit are no longer competing options, Governments are active in support of sustainable growth, there is zero tolerance of tax-dodging and corruption, and unfair trade barriers are removed? Does the Secretary of State accept that this radical aid-plus agenda, combining responsible capitalism with social justice, will require a major shift in her Government&#8217;s approach to international development?</p>

	<p pid="c.223.4/1">In talking about the golden thread, our Prime Minister has been very clear about the importance of the key building blocks for all states and societies, such as access to legal rights and respect for human rights. I think having an inclusive society is another important building block, which is why female rights are equally important. We should also listen to the people who are playing a leading role in transforming their countries, such as President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia. I draw the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s attention to an article she has written in <i>The Times</i> today entitled &#8220;Aid is not an alternative to self-sufficiency&#8221;. She starts off by quoting Margaret Thatcher, and the article gets better from then on.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.0/1" qnum="125618">India has twice the number of billionaires as our country, yet is home to more than a third of those globally who subsist on less than 80p a day. Will my right hon. Friend set out for the House the steps the Government are taking to make sure that our aid goes to the most needy in India, and is not spent on projects that could and should be supported by the Indian Government?</p>

	<p pid="c.224.1/1">I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. My predecessor had already overhauled our development programme in India so that it was more targeted on not only the poorest states, but the poorest communities in those states. However, as India continues to develop, it is right that we continue to examine that programme, which is what I am doing right now.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.2/1" qnum="125619">Following the success on meeting millennium development goal 4 on clean drinking water, the then Secretary of State committed to doubling the number of people with access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, but we are yet to see any new plans. Will the Secretary of State update the House on what progress has been made on that objective?</p>

	<p pid="c.224.3/1">We have focused a lot of our development aid on making sure that there is access to clean water and sanitation, as some of the starkest statistics are in that area. Just one in 20 people in Afghanistan have access to a pit latrine, which tells us the scale of the problem we are seeking to address. The hon. Lady is absolutely right about this, and I assure her that my Department carefully focuses on clean water provision. I will write to her with more details.</p>

We owe them and all others who have lost their lives a deep debt of gratitude. Their courage, their dedication and their sheer professionalism will never be forgotten by our nation, and our sincere condolences are with their colleagues, their friends and their families.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.9/1">I am sure that the whole House will want to associate itself with the Prime Minister&#8217;s remarks about our brave service personnel and to send our deepest condolences to their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.224.9/2">Will the Prime Minister confirm that if he cannot get a good deal for Britain in the EU budget negotiations, he will use the veto and reject any advice on this matter from those who gave our rebate away?</p>

	<p pid="c.225.0/1">I can absolutely give my hon. Friend that assurance. This Government are taking the toughest line in these budget negotiations of any Government since we joined the European Union. At best, we would like it cut, at worst, frozen, and I am quite prepared to use the veto if we do not get a deal that is good for Britain.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.0/2">But let us be clear that it is in our interests to try to get a deal, because a seven-year freeze would keep our bills down compared with annual budgets. Labour&#8217;s position is one of complete opportunism. Labour Members gave away half the rebate, they sent the budget through the roof and now they want to posture rather than get a good deal for Britain&#8212;the nation will see right through it.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.1/1">I start by joining the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Corporal David O&#8217;Connor of 40 Commando, the Royal Marines, and Corporal Channing Day of 3 Medical Regiment, the Royal Army Medical Corps. Their deaths are a reminder of the unremitting danger that our troops face on a daily basis on our behalf. They both showed the utmost courage and bravery, and our condolences go to their family and friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/2">The Prime Minister has an opportunity today to get a mandate from this House for a real-terms reduction in the EU budget&#8212;which he says he wants&#8212;over the next seven years, which he could take to the negotiations in Europe. Why is he resisting that opportunity?</p>

	<p pid="c.225.2/1">I think the whole country will see through what is rank opportunism. People have not forgotten the fact that Labour gave away half our rebate in one negotiation and agreed a massive increase to the EU budget when in government. Now, today, Labour has not even put down its own resolution on this issue. The nation will absolutely see straight through it. The right hon. Gentleman is playing politics; he is not serving the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.3/1">When it comes to consistency, the Prime Minister seems to have forgotten what he said as Leader of the Opposition just four months before the last general election&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I would have thought that Government Members were interested in what the Prime Minister said when he was Leader of the Opposition. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.225.3/2">&#8220;At a time when budgets are being cut in the UK, does the Prime Minister agree that in reviewing the EU budget, the main purpose should be to push for a real-terms cut&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-12-14.647"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 December 2012; Vol. 502, c. 647</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.225.3/3">That is what he said when he was in opposition. So, when it comes to opportunism, this Prime Minister is a gold medallist. At a time when he is cutting the education budget by 11%, the transport budget by 15% and the police budget by 20%, how can he be giving up on a cut in the EU budget before the negotiations have even begun?</p>

	<p pid="c.225.4/1">We have to make cuts in the budget because we are dealing with the record debt and deficit that Labour left us. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to talk about consistency, perhaps he can explain why his own Members of the European Parliament voted against the budget freeze that we achieved last</p>
	<p pid="c.225.4/2">year. Perhaps he can explain why the Socialists group in the European Parliament, of which he is such a proud member, is calling not for an increase in the budget, not for a freeze in the budget but for a &#8364;200 billion increase in the budget&#8212;and while they are at it, they want to get rid of the rest of the British rebate. Is that his policy?</p>

	<p pid="c.226.2/1">The Prime Minister is certainly getting very angry, Mr Speaker, but perhaps he is worried about losing the vote this afternoon. The reality is that our MEPs voted the same way as his on the motion before the European Parliament 10 days ago. He cannot convince anyone on Europe. Last year he flounced out of the December negotiations with a veto and the agreement went ahead anyway. He has thrown in the towel even before these negotiations have begun. He cannot convince European leaders; he cannot even convince his own Back Benchers. He is weak abroad, he is weak at home&#8212;it is John Major all over again.</p>

Today is a good day to talk about energy because there is more investment in renewable energy under three years of this Government than under 13 years of the Labour Government. It is a good day to talk about energy policy because we have got a green investment bank up and running. That is what is happening under this Government. There has been no change towards renewable energy. Let me explain exactly. We have a big pipeline of onshore and offshore wind projects that are coming through. We are committed to those, but all parties will have to have a debate in the House and outside about what happens once those targets are met. The right hon.

	<p pid="c.229.3/1">That was a completely useless answer. There are investors all round this country who want certainty about energy policy. It is very simple for the Prime Minister. He has one Minister who says he is totally against wind energy&#8212;that is the Energy Minister whom he appointed, having sacked the previous guy&#8212;and there is the Energy Secretary who says he is gung-ho for wind farms. The Prime Minister just has to make a choice about where he stands. After all, he has a wind turbine on his house, so I thought he was in favour of wind turbines, but here is the reality. Lord Heseltine says in his report that there are people who are resistant to his ideas. We know who they are: the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. The evidence of the past two and a half years is that deregulation, sink or swim&#8212;their answer&#8212;is not the answer. Lord Heseltine is right and they are wrong.</p>

	<p pid="c.231.1/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. Last week&#8217;s news was welcome. The economy is growing, unemployment is coming down, inflation is coming down, the rate of small business creation is going up and a million more people are employed in the private sector than there were two years ago. The one absolute certainty is that the worst approach&#8212;Michael Heseltine confirms this in his report&#8212;would be to see more spending, more borrowing and more debt, because that is what got us into the mess in the first place. The Labour party has only one growth plan: the plan to grow the deficit.</p>

	<p pid="c.231.2/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his condolences on the death of my constituent, Corporal Channing Day. She was a courageous young lady. She always wanted to join the Army and for eight years served as a medic. Her job was to save lives&#8212;to run the line of fire in order to give aid. Imagine what it meant to a wounded soldier to see someone running to help them when all hell was bursting around them and to know that they were not alone. Corporal Channing Day is not alone today. She will soon return to the bosom of her family, to her mother, father, sisters, brothers, friends and family, who loved her dearly, and to the community, which is immensely proud of her achievements. This House and this great nation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland salute her courage, bravery and heroism.</p>

	<p pid="c.231.3/1">I would be very happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues to talk about the implementation of the covenant in Northern Ireland. It is something I have spoken about with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. I know that there are issues about its implementation, but I hope that it can be done, and I would be happy to have that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.3/2">The hon. Gentleman spoke very strongly and movingly about Corporal Channing Day. I think he is absolutely right that those in the Royal Army Medical Corp do a fantastic job. It has been a huge honour and privilege for me to meet some of them, including in Afghanistan. When you see the service they provide, you really can put your hand on your heart and know that British military personnel in theatre are getting medical care that is as good as that which anyone in history ever got. What they do is truly remarkable.</p>

Might it be possible to place in <i>The House</i> magazine an article, perhaps written by the Clerk, on the importance of using the third person singular, rather than &#8220;you&#8221;, in this House? This is not just fussy parliamentarianism, but a very important point that allows us to exchange the most bitter views without making them personal. We should not &#8220;you&#8221; it, but make references in the third person. We should not throw away what is quite an important protection for us. We can be friends outside the House whatever anger we have in this Chamber, provided that we keep it to the third person.</p>

	<p pid="c.237.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to disapply the European Union Free Movement Directive 2004/38/EC; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/3">I am pleased to introduce the Bill, which is intended to restate a basic tenet of national sovereignty&#8212;the control of our borders, and the principle that who comes to live and work in our country from foreign countries should be a matter largely for the British people and their elected representatives in this House, and not solely at the discretion and by leave of a foreign political entity. Free movement between sovereign countries should first and foremost be dictated by our own national interests. That basic truth seems to have been lost in a rush to be as communautaire as possible since 2004, to the detriment of many of the constituents in whose name we serve.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/4">Few would deny that it was a major error of judgment for the Labour Government not to exercise their right to a moratorium on the free movement directive for seven years, as most other EU countries did. It could be argued that it retarded efforts to tackle welfare dependency, low educational attainment and problems with skills and social mobility among many indigenous British workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/5">A recent YouGov poll found that 78% of voters who had deserted Labour since 1997 wanted net migration to be reduced to zero. Even 67% of voters who had remained loyal to the party believed the same thing. There is no evidence to suggest that they regard EU migration differently from non-EU migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/6">I argue that the forthcoming free movement of potentially huge numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens to the UK from early 2014 will render the Government&#8217;s welfare reforms null and void, such will be the likely distortion of the labour market. In addition, as things stand, it is very likely to put a huge strain on delivery in pinch points across the UK, an issue to which I will return later. The UK Statistics Authority estimated that in the second quarter of 2012, there were 1.4 million EU citizens in work in the UK, 107,000 unemployed and 436,000 economically inactive, and 388,000 children of EU citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/7">The Bill is not about ending immigration from the EU, although there is little empirical or academic evidence that mass EU migration since 2004 has been a definitive net benefit to the UK. Instead, it is intended to ensure that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government vary the free movement directive, not least as a response to significant public concerns about immigration. It is about not repealing but disapplying the current directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/8">The Bill is about ensuring that the most talented and hard-working foreign workers and their families come to this country from the EU to help our economy grow and thrive in a fiercely competitive global marketplace. It also highlights an asymmetry in the Government&#8217;s stated policy on reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. We rightly focus on that policy, but we accept EU migration as a fait accompli.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/9">Hon. Members will recall a television documentary shown in 2006 entitled &#8220;The Poles Are Coming!&#8221;, which presaged the impact of mass EU migration on my constituency. I make no apology for seeing the issue through the prism of my constituency and the impact that uncontrolled and unplanned mass migration has had on it. Peterborough is a regional hub for transport, logistics, food processing and packaging, agriculture and horticulture, but youth unemployment nevertheless stands at 11.5%, almost twice the regional average, and almost 12,000 people in my constituency are on out-of-work benefits. Some 34,480 national insurance numbers have been issued in Peterborough since 2004, in a local authority area whose population in 2001 was 156,000, and new arrivals make up one in five of the population, which is currently estimated at 184,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/10">There is an acute shortage of primary school places. In nine of the 33 primary schools in my constituency, two thirds of the children do not speak English as their first language, and in two schools the figure is more than 96%. The problem is one of not just resources but churn&#8212;the in-term movement in and out of schools of hundreds of children of itinerant and other seasonal workers&#8212;which regrettably has an impact on educational attainment. Likewise, health services in the city are under considerable strain. The number of births in the city leapt from 3,395 in 2003 to 4,680 last year, and GP registrations of EU migrants have almost trebled over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/11">The free movement directive is primary legislation that governs the right of member state nationals, and their families, to move or reside freely in other member states for up to three months, without any conditions other than that they hold a valid passport and identity card. The directive specifically makes it clear, inter alia, that people should have &#8220;sufficient resources&#8221; for themselves and their family members so as not to become a &#8220;burden&#8221; on the &#8220;social assistance cover&#8221; in the host country, and that they should hold comprehensive sickness insurance.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/12">The host member state is not obliged to provide social assistance during the first three months of residence, and UK law precludes EU citizens and family members from residing purely on the basis of that initial right to reside. Indeed, the UK has a habitual residence test. Perversely, however, some benefits such as jobseeker&#8217;s allowance are granted under UK law. That is an example of the UK gold plating as the directive&#8217;s exemption is clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/13">Host member states are permitted to require EU citizens and their family members to register with the authorities and impose proportionate and non-discriminatory sanctions on those who fail to do so. The UK Government fail to do that, and&#8212;bizarrely&#8212;the Home Office told me in a parliamentary answer last week that such actions are &#8220;optional&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/14">Member states are also permitted to restrict rights of entry on grounds of</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/15">&#8220;public policy, public security or public health&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/16">However, the UK Government have failed ever to test those conditions or the specific issue of &#8220;proportionality&#8221; that is implicit in the directive in respect of the deportation of persistent and prolific criminals who are EU citizens. The Government have rarely invoked their ability to refuse or withdraw any right under the directive in cases of</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/17">&#8220;abuse of rights or fraud&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/18">Recently, the Spanish Government, which is facing calamitous levels of unemployment, have begun to interpret the free movement directive much more robustly. All EU citizens and family members have to register with the authorities if they wish to reside in Spain for more than three months, and through that process the Spanish authorities can check whether the requirements of the directive regarding residence after that period are fulfilled. The authorities also require notification of any change of address or marital status.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/19">In summary, the free movement directive confers the right to reside on many people who do not work or who do not have enough resources to be self-sufficient. It allows ready access to the UK&#8217;s welfare system and throws up obstacles to the implementation of robust systems to check that nationals from other EU member states, and their families, are abiding by the rules and do not pose a drain on the health service or a criminal threat to society. It prevents automatic deportation of nationals of other EU member states when they have committed a crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/20">The formula in the Bill for stopping objectionable aspects of EU law, such as the free movement directive, is straightforward. The legislation simply has to state that its provisions apply notwithstanding any provision of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/21">Under my Bill, EU nationals and their family members would have the right to reside in the UK for up to three months, on the basis of a valid passport or ID card. That would facilitate tourism, and give those willing the opportunity to find work. With the right to reside for three months, EU nationals would have to be in work or self-sufficient, and they would gain access to benefits only in exceptional circumstances. EU nationals and their family members would need to be registered, and they would have no access to public funds during the first 18 months of residence. After 18 months, British citizens would be given priority over EU nationals for local authority housing allocation, which is in particularly scarce supply. There would be no right to reside based solely on being in vocational training until the EU national in question had completed five years&#8217; continuous employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/22">The right of permanent residence would typically be granted only after a continuous 10-year period of legal residence, rather than five years as at present. EU nationals and family members would be deported after being convicted of a crime in the UK and sentenced to 12 months&#8217; imprisonment, or more, in the same way as other foreign nationals.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/23">Time does not permit me to elucidate further, but this Bill would be popular and promote fairness and equity, not least for the hard-pressed UK taxpayer. It would facilitate the migration of only the most talented EU citizens to our country, and seek to restore the almost forgotten principle of member state subsidiarity and UK national sovereignty. It is for us to decide about our borders and who we allow into our country, and for those reasons, I strongly commend this Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40509" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="239"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0001.htm#12103160001679">
	<p pid="c.239.0/1">I rise to oppose this sad and bad Bill. The Bill is sad because I find it uncomfortable to hear in the House remarks</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/2">about fellow Europeans that cast them in a uniformly negative light. There are more British citizens living and working in other EU member states as a share of our population than there are EU member states&#8217; citizens living here. The Bill is a message to the 700,000 to 800,000 British citizens who are made to feel welcome in Spain despite complaints that they are taking advantage of Spanish health care, old-age care and social security services; it is gravely worrying to the many British citizens who are opening businesses all over the EU; and it is an insult to the many EU citizens who live and work in our country and contribute enormously to all levels of our economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/3">This is a bad Bill, and I wonder whether <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> has discussed it with employers in Peterborough and the wider region, which is one of the great agricultural and food processing centres of our economy. The east Europeans are there, as they are in Hull, which is also a great food processing centre in the English national economy, because local employers cannot find local workers to do the work. That has been the pull of immigration throughout the ages. Enoch Powell had to allow many people from different Afro-Caribbean countries into the NHS, and the textile factories and foundries of west and south Yorkshire had to invite many people from Pakistan, because they could not get the legendary indigenous working class to do those jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/4">Mr Evan Davis of the BBC made a programme on that very subject. He went to King&#8217;s Lynn and the region and tried to find local workers who were willing to get up at 5 am to fill the sandwiches or to pick fruit and vegetables in uncomfortable conditions, but he could find none. The Bill would condemn to abolition the many firms in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s region and elsewhere in the country that use that labour.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/5">Let me turn to my more fundamental objection. The Bill is part of the growing attempt by the Conservative party to break apart our relationship with the EU. The four freedoms&#8212;the movement of goods, capital, people and ideas&#8212;are fundamental. We cannot sustain the other three freedoms and say that we cannot have the free movement of people. In the 1980s, we were grateful for the free movement of people, when the &#8220;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&#8221; generation had to leave their own country because of the disastrous economic policies of the Prime Minister&#8212;I forget her name&#8212;and go and find jobs in Germany.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/6">If the hon. Gentleman wants to destroy the four freedoms, he should come out and say so, but he should not think we can have sauce for the British goose, but not sauce for the German Gans or the French oie&#8212;I do not know what the Polish word for &#8220;goose&#8221; is. We cannot have a rule that says we will control every EU citizen who comes into our country and not have the 26 other EU member states saying exactly the same thing. The Minister for Immigration has made that point repeatedly in Home Office questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/7">Specifically on the question of the 2004 enlargement, the hon. Member for Peterborough has confused&#8212;I do not mean this disrespectfully, but he may be confused&#8212;the free movement of citizens and the free movement of workers. The moment countries join the EU, their citizens have complete free movement as citizens. They must obey local laws&#8212;they must register with a police station in Germany, and register and have a residents permit if</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/8">they want to live in France. I do not object to that part of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Bill. That is why I was in favour of national identity cards&#8212;I do not want to raise old issues, but they are how the rest of Europe has some idea of who comes to live within the different frontiers of EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/9">The hon. Gentleman is right that the free movement of workers could have been delayed by seven years. To begin with, France and Germany applied those measures, but within two years they found they had become unworkable and lifted them. With the free movement of people, Poles, Slovakians and so on came into France and Germany. Different nationalities go to different areas of the world. People from south-east EU member states, including the incoming Romanians, tend to gravitate to Italy and Spain, while we get Poles&#8212;for historic reasons, we have a huge Polish community here, and have had since the end of the war. We have Ryanair and easyJet flying backwards and forwards with utterly full planes between all the main British and Polish cities.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/10">I welcome that for one simple reason: Britain has always depended on a flow of European workers, particularly the citizens of the sovereign Republic of Ireland. The greatest number of non-British EU workers on the Olympic games site, which was finished magnificently and on time thanks to a huge input of EU workers, came from the Republic of Ireland. If the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Bill was put into full force, we would be saying to every friend and family in Ireland, &#8220;You&#8217;re not welcome here, except on highly restrictive terms&#8221;. Coming partly from a Scottish-Irish family, I find that very depressing. The free flow of people between our two countries has been a positive thing.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/11">The hon. Gentleman is right that after 2008, when we had the crash and the sudden spike in unemployment, employment conditions got extremely tight. As we speak, unemployment is rising in Leeds, Bradford and Rotherham, as again we create a two-nation Britain under this Government. The plain fact is that hundreds of thousands of firms as well as landlords, as well as our tax and national insurance system&#8212;everyone who works has to pay taxes and NI&#8212;have benefited from the contribution of non-British EU workers. Hundred of thousands of firms that might otherwise have relocated outside the UK in search of hard-working and, yes, low-wage workers&#8212;that is a problem&#8212;stayed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/12">The answer to that is to build more houses and schools, and to ensure that workers in all firms are treated properly. We should be applying the agency</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/13">workers directive and the new living wage idea to ensure that employers cannot discriminate against local employees&#8212;because they would have to pay everybody fairly. That is my solution to the problem. The solution is not to put up barriers or destroy the free movement of people. If we do that, we kiss goodbye to the free movement of goods and capital. Let us not think that we can take away one pillar of what makes the EU work and assume that the other pillars will stay standing. They will not. Any discrimination that we choose to apply against any fellow EU citizen will be turned back and applied to us. We need visas to go to Australia and many Commonwealth countries, and many of the latter refuse to accept our agricultural products, but they are fully accepted in every EU member state.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/14">I once asked Radek Sikorski, the Polish Foreign Minister, &#8220;What about the Poles coming to Britain?&#8221;, and he said, &#8220;Every time a Pole feels he has to leave Poland for Britain it is a disaster, a national tragedy, a loss to our nation.&#8221; He is right. We need to build the economies of these countries. Mrs Thatcher massively increased UK contributions to the EU in the 1980s in order, she said, to help grow Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece. At that time, those countries were growing, and Ireland became a country of immigration, not emigration.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.0/15">For those reasons, I ask the House to reject the Bill. I do not propose to divide the House, but, without wishing to challenge the integrity or position of the hon. Gentleman, I hope that every decent Member of Parliament will think a bit more deeply and understand that a Britain open to the world is good for us. We cannot be open for business and closed to foreigners.</p>

	<p pid="c.243.6/1">This group contains all the amendments made in the other place to the provisions allowing for a business rates retention scheme. The scheme will, for the first time in a generation, allow local areas to share in the proceeds of growth. Continuing the precedent set when the Bill was considered in this House, each amendment was introduced by the Government to make the changes that we believed would improve the Bill. The majority of the amendments are highly technical and, in several cases, have been introduced in direct response to the discussions that we have continued to hold with local government on the operation of the scheme. Other recommendations give effect to local government&#8217;s preferred approach or, in one case, to a recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.6/2">Owing to their largely technical nature, I do not plan to explain each amendment in the group in detail&#8212;though I could be tempted&#8212;but I will outline what they do. They enable the Government to deliver on our commitment fully to fund the five-year discount on business rates up to the state aid de minimis level for businesses moving to an enterprise zone before April 2015. They provide for the scheme to operate on local government&#8217;s preferred administrative approach. That approach&#8212;the collection fund approach&#8212;is currently used for council tax, and so is familiar to it, and works well. They also provide for the appropriate assurance of calculation and information supplied under the business rates retention scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.6/3">The amendments will also clarify some points of detail for local government. In particular, they will remove any ambiguity about the basis on which local authorities can apply for a safety net payment on account&#8212;an important process. Authorities anticipate that they will need safety net support and will be able to access that support before the end of the financial year, and to simplify the arrangements for designing a pool without reducing the safeguards in place for pool authorities by removing the duty to undertake consultation with those likely to be affected by a pooling designation or revocation and in direct response to strongly held views of local government on this point.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.6/4">Taken together, these technical amendments to the non-domestic rating provisions will give effect to smooth implementation of the rates retention scheme, and I urge hon. Members to agree to them.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.0/1">As the Minister said, many of the amendments in this group are technical. I do not wish to take up too much time on them&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> That is the Minister&#8217;s job, not mine. If his Whips want him to talk for longer, that is his problem. There are a number of issues I want to raise in relation to one or two amendments.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/2">We do not have a problem with Lords amendment 1 or the subsequent amendments dealing with discretionary rate relief in enterprise zones, or with Lords amendment 2, which implements a recommendation by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. We support that, as we did in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/3">The group of amendments beginning with Lords amendment 19, however, which deals with administration of the rate retention system, raises a couple of questions on which I would appreciate clarification from the Minister. Billing authorities are being required to estimate their income before the start of the financial year. That estimate will determine the amount to be paid to Government as a central share and the amount to be paid to precepting authorities, to be transferred to their own funds. There are a number of amendments consequent on that change. If amounts are different, I understand that they will appear as surpluses or deficits on the authority&#8217;s collection fund. However, will the Minister clarify what would happen where a firm paying a major proportion of the authority&#8217;s business rates closed down mid-year&#8212;an example we have raised throughout the Bill&#8217;s progress? Surely that would lead to a deficit in the collection fund, so what would the local authority&#8217;s position would be? Can a collection fund be run at a deficit, or would the shortfall have to be made up from reserves? I should make it clear that I am talking about a really catastrophic event, such as a firm that pays maybe 20% or 30% of the business rates in an area closing down, as happened with Alcan in Northumberland, for example.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/4">As the Minister said, Lords amendments 34 to 38 deal with the arrangements for assurance. It is rather typical of the muddled way in which the Government go about things that they are having to make arrangements to take effect subsequent to the abolition of the Audit Commission before they have actually abolished it&#8212;so far they have only a draft Bill. The amendments ensure that the Secretary of State will define the assurance requirements though directions and produce certification instructions&#8212;I am sure he will work on them personally over the Christmas holiday. The amendments show the mess that the Government have got themselves into. They have no legislation ready to abolish the Audit Commission, yet they are having to put in place provisions in this Bill. The Government have ended up giving yet more power to the Secretary of State, in what was supposed to be a Bill to give more power to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.0/5">I would be grateful if the Minister clarified those points before we move on to the next group of amendments.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.1/1">I welcome the stance that my hon. Friend the Minister has taken with this Bill. It is sensible to adopt the Lords amendments that he has outlined, and I am glad to see them. When I was responsible for the Bill in my previous role, they seemed to me to offer useful clarification and to strengthen the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/2">I am particularly pleased that my hon. Friend referred to pooling. It is important that we encourage local authorities to explore to the maximum the opportunities that pooling makes available. The reason for that&#8212;the reason I think the Lords amendments are helpful&#8212;is that as the economy picks up, as it will, development opportunities will in many cases enhance the interdependency of neighbouring authorities. My London borough of Bromley is a good example. Many people in Bromley work in central London, but they are effectively part of the same economic area. The borough council pays for the services it gives people as residents, who contribute to the London economy through their work in the west end, the City of London or elsewhere, including, in some cases, across London borough boundaries&#8212;they may work in Croydon or somewhere such as that.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/3">There is therefore great merit in giving local authorities not only the maximum flexibility to pool, but the maximum encouragement to do so, because one would not want a council to approve a substantial development on its boundaries that might bring it all the financial benefits, but which needed planning support from neighbouring authorities under the duty to co-operate and their good will because of where the work force come from. Pooling is important, and the Lords amendments give us sensible flexibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/4">Importantly, pooling fits with some of the other parts of the Government&#8217;s localism agenda. One of the arguments made earlier&#8212;I noted it in their lordships&#8217; discussion&#8212;was about enabling local authorities to have adequate critical mass with their retained business rates, which they can use for tax increment financing, for example. The Bill has been important in taking steps forward on that. A pool will have a greater critical mass of funding, which can be used to approach the markets and enables greater leverage.</p>

	<p pid="c.245.0/1">My hon. Friend did a great deal of work on the Bill, for which I thank him. The Select Committee on Communities and Local Government visited Manchester some months ago, where we saw some fantastic examples of regeneration. Some had gone incredibly well, although admittedly one or two had not gone quite so well. Does he feel that pooling arrangements are likely to help such projects in future?</p>

	<p pid="c.245.1/1">I believe they can. Manchester is an interesting example. Indeed, my hon. Friend must be intuitive, because I was about to say that pooling can often fit sensibly with the other development that we have seen&#8212;in which Manchester has been something of a pathfinder&#8212;which is the establishment of joint authorities. It is a classic means of dealing with co-operation by local authorities from the bottom up without the need for&#8212;dare I say it in the current climate?&#8212;unitary reorganisation. The ability to form a joint authority creates the ability to procure jointly, pool business rates jointly and, therefore, invest jointly, as well as a raft of other things, which are beyond the scope of this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.245.2/1">I am with the hon. Gentleman on pooling and how economies such as those in Greater Manchester work, but he should not get too carried away with the Manchester</p>
	<p pid="c.245.2/2">example, because my understanding is that Tory Trafford and Liberal Democrat Stockport are not very keen on the idea of pooling resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.0/1">All those authorities signed up to the concept of the joint authority. Any pooling will have to involve sensible negotiation between the various authorities about what is in their mutual interest. I would have thought that a degree of caution was perfectly understandable at this stage in the process. The important thing we are doing in this Bill is putting in place the legislative means to enable areas such as Manchester and other areas with pooling to take up more of the opportunities as, I hope, confidence grows. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that the ability to pool is yet another reason the Government have no intention of going down the route of imposing top-down unitary reorganisation&#8212;I am sure this is a timely moment at which to remind ourselves of that point. I hope that the opportunity to pool will also encourage other conurbations to develop a similar approach to that being taken in Greater Manchester. Pooling would provide a means of achieving many of the benefits of what were once described as city regions, without the need for the top-down imposition that went with those arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.1/1">Does my hon. Friend envisage pooling working across county boundaries? My constituency lies in the east Lancashire economic area&#8212;within which co-operation would work well&#8212;but quite a lot of the economic activity spreads over into Yorkshire. For example, a lot of businesses have their headquarters in Lancashire and premises in Yorkshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.246.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="246"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0001.htm#12103160001691">
	<p pid="c.246.2/1">I must confess that my view on that has shifted somewhat. I was initially sceptical about cross-county boundary pooling, because of the potential administrative complexities involved. For example, we would have to consider how to deal with the tier split where two-tier areas were involved. It might be easier to achieve where only adjoining unitaries were involved. We should not rule it out totally, however. It is important to recognise that the proposal that we are debating fits into the broader localism agenda, in that it recognises that economic geography might not follow the purely administrative geography of an area. I am in favour of maximum flexibility, and my hon. Friend has raised a good example. In my area, Bromley probably would fall within the area of Greater London, but there are some local authorities on the edge of London, such as Thurrock, Slough and Watford, whose economic geography would make them as much a part of the London economic area as of the shire county of which they are a part. So I hope that the Government will consider this as an option, provided that the technical issues can be resolved. Perhaps the Minister will deal in detail with the important point that my hon. Friend has just raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.2/2">It is particularly useful to explore that point in the context of the pool providing an opportunity to raise funding for infrastructure investment. Earlier this week, in our debate on the Public Service Pensions Bill, we discussed raising the cap on the amount of local authority pension funds that could be put into infrastructure investment. I favour raising the cap, as the Bill proposes. The proposal before us today would provide yet another</p>
	<p pid="c.246.2/3">means of raising revenue streams that could be put together to enhance the amount of a local authority&#8217;s investment leverage.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.2/4">It is worth bearing it in mind that that happens elsewhere in Europe. We see a degree of it in the Federal Republic of Germany, but the area that I know best is in France. The French have developed quite sophisticated models of co-operation, known as communaut&#233;s urbaines. They are generally similar to a Greater Manchester-style joint authority, stretching across a conurbation. An example that I know well is that of greater Toulouse, which, thanks to the pooling of resources, has been able to procure, invest and deliver infrastructure jointly. This has led to the development of a metro system in Toulouse, a tramway going out to the suburbs and improved road links to Blagnac airport. Toulouse is an historic city with a considerable learning pool in the centre, but it is also inextricably linked to A&#233;rospatiale and the avionics industries around Blagnac, which are outside the municipal boundary. I am reminded that such co-operation was the logic behind local enterprise partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.0/1">My hon. Friend knows my constituency well. I see parallels between his examples and the expansion of Southend airport, which is owned by Southend unitary authority but located in the district of Rochford. How would the proposals impact on my constituents? It sounds as though they could present an exciting opportunity.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="247"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0001.htm#12103160001693">
	<p pid="c.247.1/1">I am quite well acquainted with my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, and I have visited Southend airport on a number of occasions. He has provided a classic example of how pooling could unlock significant opportunities. As he knows, Southend&#8217;s boundaries are tightly drawn around its urban area, but it is clearly part of a broader south Essex conurbation. Its development opportunities, of which the airport is an example, lie almost entirely outside its boundary, but people would think of them as being part of Southend because they form part of the economic area. It would cause all manner of upheaval if we were to resolve the problems through the top-down imposition of a unitary structure in south-east Essex, as we have seen happen elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/2">This kind of pooling, however, would give Southend and the neighbouring Rochford district an incentive to share the benefits that would come from the development of areas in Rochford that were on the periphery of Southend. The pooling of the retained rates would enhance Rochford&#8217;s council tax base. The measure would also make Southend a more attractive business destination, because it would be able to open up economic development and infrastructure opportunities that it would be unable to do entirely within its own boundary.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/3">My hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency provides a good example of how pooling could work. I can envisage Southend, Rochford and, say, Castle Point forming a natural economic subset that would hold together very willingly. The south-east local enterprise partnership, comprising Essex, Kent and East Sussex, is the largest in the country. That would probably not be regarded as a logical area in which to pool, although it might be more appropriate in some of the smaller LEPs that fit more tightly the economic geography of their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/4">Speaking as an Essex boy myself, I should point out that, in areas such as that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40503" name="James Duddridge">the Member for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge)</phrase>, pooling would take place across boundaries, in a sense. Although all the places concerned are all in Essex, Southend is a unitary authority and the two areas surrounding it&#8212;its hinterland&#8212;are still districts in the two-tier county of Essex. The point about the ability to pool across boundaries is important, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will address the technical issues involved. In this case, how would we resolve the question of Southend unitary authority not having to do a tier split of its benefit from the pool, even though the two surrounding districts would have to take into account the tier split? I do not think that the problem is beyond being reconciled, and such pooling would provide a powerful tool to encourage inward investment into Southend.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/5">The same would apply to another part of the Thames Gateway with which I am familiar, on the other side of the river, in the Medway towns. It would be sensible to give them the opportunity to have a pooling arrangement with their adjoining districts in the two-tier county of Kent. It would therefore make sense to sort out any technical obstacles to that type of flexibility. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40507" name="Jake Berry">the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase> suggested, even starker cases that cross long-established country boundaries could still make sense in economic terms. There is considerable merit in the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/6">It has rightly been observed that this proposal is by no means the only element in what is a considerable stream of technical amendments in this group. It would probably be appropriate if I now dealt with the others as best I can&#8212;unless I stray off course, Mr Speaker, although I know that you will not let me do that.</p>

	<p pid="c.248.2/1">Before my hon. Friend rushes on to his next point, may I slow him down a little and draw him back to the pooling of funds? He has spoken eloquently about my constituency of Rochford and Southend East, but does he think that areas involved in such pooling arrangements need to be contiguous? For example, there are many synergies between Thurrock, a unitary, and Southend, another unitary. The two are close, but they do not actually touch. Similarly, along the Thames Gateway line, we see places such as Margate and other seaside towns that could work well together even though they are not neighbours. Would they still be able to pool?</p>

	<p pid="c.248.3/1">That is taking the argument beyond what I was considering when I left office, which gave me more time to reflect on these matters. My hon. Friend and I both had a little time to reflect over the summer. Like me, he has been putting it to constructive use. I think there is merit in providing that option: why not? If the economic geography is such that the two areas hang together, why should we rule out such a possibility? In this day and age, investment decisions will be driven</p>
	<p pid="c.248.3/2">precisely by factors such as economic characteristics, infrastructure opportunities and the nature of the work force and the market, rather than by geographic contiguity alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.3/3">I mentioned earlier, for example, that Slough has a great deal in common with the economy of west London, without being actually contiguous to the London borough of Hillingdon. As I recall, a little bit of the county of Berkshire is located between the two. If such arrangements were wanted, merit could be seen in allowing Slough to enter into a pool with Hillingdon, with some other west London authorities or with Watford. Equally, going in the other direction, Slough might want to involve Reading. There is an argument for saying that there is a natural economic geography that starts almost at the Hammersmith flyover and which goes out through Brentford and then through what is generally called silicon valley. Those opportunities are also important.</p>

	<p pid="c.249.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an interesting argument. I wonder if I might plumb his expertise a little further. It occurs to me that some of the local enterprise partnerships that have been formed are natural economic areas that plainly do not run according to local authority boundaries. I am thinking particularly of what I think is called the Gatwick partnership, which runs from Croydon all the way down to Brighton. Indeed, in my own county of Hampshire, we have the M3 partnership, which runs up that artery towards the businesses and markets of London. I want to examine my hon. Friend&#8217;s knowledge on this subject. Is it possible for local authorities to pool partially, as it seems to me that in certain cases&#8212;with the Solent partnership, for example&#8212;there would be some logic in that? It seems right and proper that some of the moneys from Portsmouth and Southampton should be invested in that partnership or be centred on its work, but perhaps those two cities could look outside that area as well. Will he explain how that might work?</p>

	<p pid="c.249.1/1">I suppose it comes back to the technical issues that I mentioned on coping with tier splits in two-tier areas. We should not rule out the ability to try to achieve that, particularly if it can be done by agreement. It would be interesting to see if partial pooling could be achieved. It might not be something that happens at the beginning, but the point to remember about the whole of this local government finance reform is that it is making a major change in providing the legal mechanisms and the tools necessary for local authorities to use in relation to retained business rates. That is very important in itself, as this is, after all, the first time in many of our political lifetimes that the Treasury has forgone an element of revenue.</p>
	<p pid="c.249.1/2">At the moment, all the business rates are, in effect, nationalised, taken back to the Treasury and distributed on a formulaic basis, which does not provide the sort of incentive for economic development and investment that we all wish to see. The Bill puts that right. I hope it will be possible to make pooling more attractive over time. As the deficit is paid down and the economy grows, the local share available to go into the pool can perhaps increase from its current 50% level. That would make retention as a whole and pooling more attractive,</p>
	<p pid="c.249.1/3">because the pot produced from the pool will, of course, be greater, and therefore even more attractive as a potential investment vehicle. I think we should examine the case with some care.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.0/1">As my hon. Friend develops his argument, I would be interested to hear how his views might relate to east Lancashire. When we formed the LEP, the borough council of Rossendale, which I represent, did not want to go into a wider Lancashire LEP. Eventually, it did so, however, and I think the then Housing Minister made absolutely the right decision on that occasion, as the arrangement has proved to be a great success. When it comes to the pooling of two-tier authorities, I could foresee a situation in which Rossendale council, which looks south towards Manchester for economic growth, would want to team up with the Associated Greater Manchester Authorities, but Lancashire county council could wish it to remain within Lancashire county for pooling purposes. In that exact situation, in my hon. Friend&#8217;s opinion, who would have sway and which argument would win?</p>

	<p pid="c.250.1/1">If I were a lawyer, like my hon. Friend, I would be advising the parties to try to come to some negotiation rather than litigating, if I might put it that way, as it would not be in the authorities&#8217; interest to get into a dispute. The general approach has been, of course, that in the two-tier areas the bulk of the incentive should rightly go to the planning authority, as its members have to take the decision to allow development that may sometimes be controversial. It is right for such an authority to say to its electors, or to the people who sometimes complain about what the planning authorities do, that there are benefits to come from looking at the bigger picture, some of which will be captured for the local communities. I can see why that would be a sensible development, but it does not mean that I have become an advocate of unitary restructuring. It might be simpler, but the fact remains that the two-tier option has been taken into account in respect of the structures put in place by the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.4/1">I apologise for not having been able to be present at the start of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s contribution, but I have come in at a very interesting part of his speech. Does this not show up the exact problem with two-tier areas and two-tier authorities, in that fostering and supporting economic growth is so much more than simply the planning system, as it involves education, skills and transport? Many such responsibilities in two-tier areas are held at county level rather than at district level.</p>

	<p pid="c.250.5/1">I do not see it as a problem; the issue can be grappled with and dealt with. The right hon. Gentleman and I have debated unitary restructuring on more than one occasion over the years, and we end up on different sides of the fence. My point is that through</p>
	<p pid="c.250.5/2">co-operation it is possible to ensure that the economic development levers, which generally sit with the county council, can be sensibly allied to the development levers, which sit with the district council. A good example can be found in Essex, as Chelmsford has a successful local planning authority in Chelmsford borough council&#8212;it might now be Chelmsford city council since the town has been given city status&#8212;and has not experienced the friction that is sometimes used as an argument to justify unitary authorities. Both the county and its county town have recognised that it is in both their economic interests to grow Chelmsford as a significant hub in that part of the world. In that case, unitary reorganisation was not necessary to achieve significant economic regeneration in Chelmsford.</p>
	<p pid="c.250.5/3">I have to say that some of the downsides of unitary reorganisation that we saw under the previous Government, when it was enforced against the wishes of the local authorities, were a distraction from the serious job of getting on with economic development, promotion of the area and encouraging investment by sensible planning decisions. These issues can never be seen in isolation. The incentives in the Bill, linked with the duty to co-operate in planning terms, provide a further incentive for sensible arrangements not only between adjoining local planning authorities, but with the county authority as a highway authority, as highway considerations are often important in determining where development is acceptable and therefore where the investment might come from.</p>

Friend&#8217;s generosity in giving way, first because I know that he is eager to deal with other matters in his speech and I do not wish to delay him unduly, and secondly because to describe myself as a novice when it comes to local government finance would be an insult to novices throughout the country. I have learned more about the subject as a result of listening to my hon. Friend, who exhibits the patience of Aristotle teaching one of his slower students.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.4/2">My question relates partly to the issue of two-tier and one-tier local authorities and their decision-making processes, and partly to the interaction between the attitudes to pooling taken by local authorities and those taken by the local and broader business communities. May I briefly draw a parallel? Sometimes there is a clear understanding between teachers and people who wish to set up a free school, but the project is delayed by some intransigence or slowness of understanding on the part of the local authority. Similarly, different authorities have different ideas about how they wish to proceed. For example, my own county, which benefits from unitary structures, contains some rather small areas. Will my hon. Friend comment on that?</p>

	<p pid="c.252.0/1">My hon. Friend has raised a couple of important points. I shall begin with the last, if I may&#8212;and I shall not forget the other Members who wish to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/2">We should not make the error of thinking that unitary status is always a solution. Some unitary authorities that are on the small side do not follow their natural boundaries, and their critical mass is towards the lower end of the scale in terms of economic, financial and managerial capacity. It is clear to us now that the creation of a string of fairly small unitaries was not necessarily the best solution. We should not assume that unitary is always good and two-tier is always bad. Some unitaries work and some do not; some two-tier areas work, while in others there are tensions. We need to ensure that they work better in future, and I believe that the Bill and the Lords amendments will be one means of helping them to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.0/3">My hon. Friend&#8217;s point about perception is important too. I experienced some frustration when I was first elected as a councillor in the London borough of Havering in 1974&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40302" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase> that it was a little after the Municipal Reform Act 1835, but it was a while ago nevertheless. In those days, not only was I one of the few members of our 60-odd-strong council who were interested in taking part in the pan-London bodies that we had to have, but I was regarded as very dangerous&#8212;dangerously outward-looking&#8212;because I had stood for the Greater London Council as well. In 1974, some members of the borough council still thought in terms of the two predecessor authorities. We did not have cabinets in those days, but there was concern about whether the committee chairmen were drawn sufficiently from the Romford end or the Hornchurch end, even if they were members of the same political party. That inward-looking tendency is one of the bigger challenges that we face in dealing with local government as a whole, but attitudes have improved massively since those days in 1974, which is to local government&#8217;s credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.252.2/1">You are, as always, the guardian of rectitude in this place, Mr Deputy Speaker, and, as you know, I am always the willing servant of rectitude in these matters. The point that I was making was that we had indeed moved on a great deal since 1974, in terms of thinking as well as chronology. The situation is better than it was. However, we still have to deal with some entrenched thinking. I believe that, by promoting pooling, the amendment can break down some of that thinking, which, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford, can spill into other areas of policy decision-making as well as those relating to local government finance. I hope that, by encouraging economic investment, pooling will make it easier and more desirable to provide the educational opportunities cited by my hon. Friend in the context of</p>
	<p pid="c.252.2/2">free schools. His point was well made: all the various legislative measures interact as part of a broader localism agenda.</p>

I think that it contains much that we, as a Government, would wish to take on board. As for the specific point raised by the hon.

Perhaps you will allow me a slightly lengthy intervention, Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to avoid a lengthy speech from me later in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.253.4/2">The &#8220;Commentary on Lords amendments&#8221; in the explanatory notes refers to &#8220;billing authorities&#8221; and &#8220;precepting authorities&#8221;. My hon. Friend has already referred to planning authorities and highways authorities. In fact, the commentary uses the phrase &#8220;major precepting authorities&#8221;, but does not explain what &#8220;major&#8221; means in this context. Perhaps I am slightly sensitive about such terms because I represent a slightly smaller precepting authority, but is a distinction being made between parish</p>
	<p pid="c.253.4/3">and district councils, or between major and minor precepting authorities? My hon. Friend knows a great deal more about these matters than I do, but I was equally confused by the reference to billing authorities, given that police and fire authorities are effectively billing authorities. What do those terms actually mean?</p>

	<p pid="c.254.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a fair point. You will be familiar, Mr Deputy Speaker, with a joke that is well known in local government finance circles. It is said that the formula grant is like the Schleswig-Holstein question. Only three people have ever understood it; one is dead, one has gone mad, and the third has forgotten. The same is true of some of the complexities of local government finance. When I arrived at the Department for Communities and Local Government, I was not wholly convinced that that was a joke, but there were some very sound officials who put me right on all occasions.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/2">The nomenclature to which my hon. Friend refers is slightly historic, but it is important. For practical purposes, the billing authority will be the unitary authority in the case of the Southend part of my his constituency, and the district council in the Rochford part. In most cases the major precepting authority is a county council. In Greater London, in my case, the London borough of Bromley is the billing authority, but the Mayor of London and the Greater London authority is the major preceptor. I think fire and police authorities also count as major precepting authorities. That is because of how they have developed and become separated from the county councils, although they were originally intended to be part of them.</p>

	<p pid="c.254.4/1">That point is slightly different from the pooling point. I was talking about the provisions that deal with the tier splits. We are returning some of the moneys&#8212;the business rate&#8212;directly to local government. That was formerly taken by the Treasury and distributed by formula grant. Some of those moneys will be needed to fund district council functions in two-tier areas, and some will be needed to fund county council functions in two-tier areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.4/2">That highlights why there has to be a passing of money. It is collected by the billing authority; that is the case at the moment. Southend borough council and Rochford district council collect all the business rates and then have to send the money to central Government as, I think, a monthly payment. It is then returned in the local government finance settlement each year, predominantly by way of the formula grant&#8212;although there are one or two other grants, as this is a slightly complex world. We are allowing authorities to keep some of that money at the beginning, but because it has to fund two types of authority&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.255.3/2">I have outlined the essence of the issue, and the reasons why we have references to billing authorities and major precepting authorities. There are other precepts; the parish council can levy a precept, but it is not a major precepting authority. Very occasionally, there will also be certain levies put on top, but for our current purposes we need not discuss that and add further confusion.</p>
	<p pid="c.255.3/3">Usually the district council in a two-tier area is the planning authority, and it is also the billing authority. Importantly, however, for investment purposes&#8212;this is where this point links in with the question of business rates retention&#8212;the highway authority will tend to be the county council, which often has significant economic development resources that district councils do not have, and the education authority will be the most significant body for the skills agenda and in attracting the required work force. That is why pooling makes sense. It links the pooling of resources with pooling and collaboration on a raft of issues, which is essential in the modern world.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.9/1">My hon. Friend makes a fair point. When seeking clarity on these matters, we are sometimes bedevilled by history. A passenger transport authority would, I suspect, be a levying authority rather than a precepting authority for the purposes under discussion. At present, it would not necessarily fall within the scope of this pooling. It is important to raise such topics, however. There must be a means whereby the pooling of retained business rates includes incentives for transport authorities. In Greater Manchester, the solution has been the creation of a joint authority. There might be merit in considering a similar solution in Birmingham. I am sure the Minister will take that point on board, and I ask him to address it in his concluding remarks. It is also worth pointing out that if there is a large amount</p>

	<p pid="c.257.5/1">When I was in the Department, we did not get into the issue of pooling council tax, for the simple reason that we were dealing with the business rates element. As I saw it, the first step in the equation was to secure the return of a significant amount of business rates revenue to local authorities, rather than for it to be taken back through the nationalised system, as I might call it, whereby it goes to the Treasury and is then redistributed through the formula grant, the point being that over a period of time we would be able to make local authorities less dependent on formula grant as the principal source of their income.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.5/2">Interestingly, we should perhaps explore, as a future step along the road, the means whereby local authorities might voluntarily&#8212;I stress that this must have a voluntary basis&#8212;examine ways of aligning their council tax receipts. After all, authorities can seek to pool the product of that in their investment decisions at the moment. I referred to the success of the communaut&#233;s urbaines in France, which has come about because they have been able to set up joint investment funds and procure directly.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.5/3">In a sense, they have been putting together the product of their local taxes, and we might able to do that. We must remember that the billing authority sets the level of council tax in any given place, but there is no reason now why local authorities in an area could not deliberately align their council tax levels if they wished to do so to make sure that their area was not disadvantaged economically by having different rates within what might be almost the same built-up area. That is important. The level of the business rate is not changed by these proposals, because the multiplier continues to be set nationally, but the incentive is in retaining the product. The amendment provides us with the important tool of giving maximum flexibility in the pooling of the product to get the maximum benefit from investment for the area, particularly in economic development terms.</p>

	<p pid="c.258.0/1">On the amendment and its effect on enterprise zones, I have been an advocate of the do-it-yourself enterprise zone, which I hope could be achieved in east Lancashire, along the M65 corridor, by using the localisation of business rates. Local authorities would be able to give rate holidays to people who set up new businesses within a DIY enterprise zone. This amendment allows a deduction for rates which should have been in the enterprise zone. Would that preclude the DIY enterprise zone or encourage such a zone?</p>

	<p pid="c.258.1/1">It ought to be a means of encouraging that type of zone. That seems to be the logic of the proposal. Being able to offset and make the deduction is necessary in ensuring that there is an incentive. I am sure that the Minister will be able to confirm that position. My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen makes an important point about the interaction of pooling and enterprise zones: it is important not to create a disincentive to having an enterprise zone. Equally, we must not create a distortion in the local economy whereby investment is purely sucked into an enterprise zone because of the benefits, and other parts of the local authority area or the conurbation, which happen not to be in an enterprise zone but have real development opportunities, are set at a disadvantage. It is important to make sure that we get that interaction right.</p>

We should seek to give the maximum flexibility to local authorities on how they use these various tools, because that is genuinely localist. What will be appropriate in Rossendale will probably not be appropriate in Bromley, but it is sensible that those alternatives are available. I want an emphasis on outcomes, rather than on structure or process. Breaking down the barriers that can sometimes be an impediment is an important part of that. My hon. Friend the</p>

The solution that the Government propose is workable and elegant, and will merit attention. The amendments clarify and strengthen the position, so I hope that they will also commend themselves to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/3">Important amendments are also proposed to the schedules in respect of the position of major precepting and billing authorities. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East is not in his place, as those amendments will help to clarify the issues he raised. I hope that those amendments, too, will be seen as important and valuable. Although there are a lot of them, they deal with certain themes, and all of them, taken together, represent a significant strengthening of the Bill. I hope that this stream of amendments will commend itself to the House.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, who has identified some key issues that are important both generally and in relation to particular areas. I want to add to his comments on pooling and the arrangements for different types of authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.2/2">I represent a constituency that has district councils, a county council and a unitary authority. Indeed, Dorset&#8217;s local enterprise partnership has boundaries that encompass</p>
	<p pid="c.259.2/3">two unitaries, umpteen districts and the county council. It is important that we should be clear on how pooling can take place so that we can facilitate it, because I certainly see it as a driver for growth. The important point, however, is about choice. Some authorities might not want to play and although that might be a pity, the important point is that this is all about our localism agenda and putting more power into people&#8217;s hands at the lowest possible level.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.0/1">Rather than yielding to recommendation 11 of Lord Heseltine&#8217;s report, which is that we should impose unitary authorities, is it not true that we are much more likely to get unitary-type authorities by accretion through election and localism than by imposing them from the top down? They will also last longer and be more robust.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.1/1">I sincerely believe that the driver must come from local people at a local level. Anything imposed from above inhibits good local decision making and will inhibit growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.1/2">I am talking about making decisions at the lowest possible level and I and, I assume, many other Members have been lobbied by the National Association of Local Councils. Of course, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst dealt with the question of the distribution of the business rates between the billing authority and the precepts but, as I understand it, town and parish councils do not come into the equation. I would be very pleased if the Minister could clarify the difference the amendments will make and how it will be possible for the billing authority to drive activity down to the local level and to town and parish councils. I happen to be attending the annual meeting of the Dorset Association of Town and Parish Councils on Saturday, so it would be helpful if I could be clear about what we pass today.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.2/1">Were we to consider devolving fiscal powers to town and parish councils, would we not also need to review their functions as a corollary? In comparison with international examples, our town and parish councils have very limited functions that are at the most micro level&#8212;they have powers on just street lights, fencing and allotments, for example. If we are going to take an holistic approach, we should perhaps consider in their entirety the functions that we expecting parish and town councils to discharge.</p>

	<p pid="c.260.3/1">There have been many innovations in some areas with the close working of councils at all levels. We want to generate a spirit of that happening at all levels, because we all know that in difficult economic circumstances parish and town councils have taken over some functions. It has happened rather naturally and sometimes it works well, such as when they have the &#8220;Links&#8221; man deal with all the weeds. It can be as simple as that, but there is a lot more scope for such working. I agree with my hon. Friend on that general principle.</p>
	<p pid="c.260.3/2">Let me return to the thrust of this whole section of the Bill: the business rate retention scheme. It is incredibly important to add to the growth agenda and it is an important ingredient. It puts local decision making where it should be and provides opportunities and flexibility. I hope that with our good growth figures during the last quarter, we will all be incentivised to do</p>
	<p pid="c.260.3/3">the best we can for our local economies. Members of Parliament should take a leadership role and support those organisations. What an opportunity!</p>
	<p pid="c.260.3/4">Finally, I believe that the Local Government Association is in favour of the retention of the local business rates, but there are of course doubts about the details. May I ask the Minister whether the LGA is fully behind the amendments? It is true that Members of the other place scrutinised the Bill extremely thoroughly. Some very good ideas came out of that scrutiny and although I totally support the thrust of the amendments, I merely seek the clarification that I have requested.</p>

	<p pid="c.261.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman admonishes me. It was powerful and eloquent. The hon. Lady has great experience in local government in Dorset and she added to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.2/2">It is timely to remember the basis on which business rates were centralised. I do not want to go too much into the history, but there was a significant degree of criticism of the decision of the previous Conservative Government to centralise business rates. There was an historical context, however, given what happened in too many of our large municipalities under the metropolitan district councils, particularly in the midlands and the north of England. The local councils had a mandate, and I accept that, and were elected by local ratepayers&#8212;later council tax payers&#8212;but they often used that mandate to attack the policies of central Government. One way they did that was by significantly increasing business rates, which were then localised, above the rate of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.2/3">The Government had to choose what to do about that fiscal weapon, used disproportionately by Labour councils, and its impact on regeneration, growth, business development and entrepreneurship in the areas where it was used. That was the context. I am a localist&#8212;actually, I was a localist, but I am probably now a born-again centralist. However, I was then a localist.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.2/4">I must not be too unkind to the right hon. Lord Heseltine, but I fear that his views on regeneration have ossified and, perhaps, stopped in about 1981. The answer to every question for Lord Heseltine involves banging the table, big figures, big organisations and big macho approaches to local government, but that does not always reflect the nuances of the different power structures and checks and balances in modern local government in a 21st-century country. I hope that I have not been too unkind to Lord Heseltine, but I am sure he has heard worse&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> He speaks incredibly highly of me. He is a very talented man who created a fantastic business&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.262.6/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for taking an intervention on such an important point. May I remind him that One North East, the RDA for the north-east, was independently assessed as delivering &#163;4.50 to the regional economy for every pound of public investment?</p>

	<p pid="c.262.7/1">When I was shadow regeneration Minister, I met One North East in a rather salubrious hotel in central Newcastle. I agree that it did some good work, but if we consider all the regional development agencies throughout the country, they failed in two respects. They did not ameliorate the internal divisions in the economies in their areas, because even in the north-east,</p>
	<p pid="c.262.7/2">the economies of Stockton and Middlesbrough are amazingly different from those of Morpeth and Hexham, and they are amazingly different from those of Bishop Auckland or the City of Durham. At the same time, the RDAs failed to tackle social, demographic and economic inequalities between the regions, and they did not facilitate the growth in private sector jobs and regeneration that we would have wanted in the north-west and the north-east, although that did happen in London, the south-east and the south-west.</p>

	<p pid="c.263.0/1">May I reinforce my hon. Friend&#8217;s point? I am sure that he is aware not only that the regional development agency system failed to address such regional inequalities, but that inequality between the regions actually grew rather than reduced under the Labour Government, despite the expense of such a top-heavy bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="c.263.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a typically astute point. The Local Government Association did not have an axe to grind against the previous Government, but it produced several reports showing that the significant public investment in regional development agencies under that Labour Government did not deliver objective outputs. My hon. Friend and I have scrutinised regeneration legislation that has addressed those points.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/2">There is an intellectual coherence in the Bill because if we are devolving power to the lowest level, which the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole talked about, and if we are to give local authorities a vested interest&#8212;and fiscal incentive&#8212;in driving regeneration and growth on the basis of local priorities, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40507" name="Jake Berry">the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase> mentioned, local enterprise partnerships are the model to use. Those partnerships are driven by business and give local authorities of whatever political persuasion the opportunity to show leadership and vision.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/3">I will be honest with hon. Members: there are some fantastic Labour councils, such as Lewisham and Wigan. I am positive about Wigan, which is a fantastic place to live, because my wife is from there. It is unfortunate that it has a Labour council, but to give it its due, it is doing a good job. The local enterprise partnerships have a complementary relationship with the new homes bonus, and there is therefore a fiscal incentive to drive forward a philosophy on the basis of local need. Money comes into the pot via the new homes bonus, and then local authorities may make a value judgment about whether the quality of life in their area is such that they wish to build hundreds or thousands of new homes, or to keep things as they are. Authorities know that they will not get that fiscal incentive for the delivery of core services. My local authority in Peterborough wants to build 25,000 homes between 2009 and 2026, so it will have a fiscal incentive to encourage the building of private sector and shared equity housing, as well as social and affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/4">The Bill rights a wrong that has existed among the political classes in local government for years. Our country does not devolve sufficient power locally, and our rate of raising money locally is probably the lowest in the western world. We have not engaged as we should have done over the years in things such as residential</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/5">estate investment trusts and giving fiscal incentives for the building of private sector housing. We have not engaged with local authority bonds, unlike as in Canada and the United States. It is anathema to us that we should use a bond issue to fund the building of a bridge, a community centre or a new road, but that happens in every municipality in the United States. Boards of supervisors and mayors in towns, counties, cities and states throughout America think nothing of that, but for us it is like another world. It is good that we are now focusing on delivering infrastructure that is aligned with local people&#8217;s priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.263.1/6">I know that you will forgive me, Mr Deputy Speaker, for my little perambulation observing the vicissitudes in Lord Heseltine&#8217;s thoughts about regeneration. However, the Bill makes sense and gives weight to the Government&#8217;s real commitment to localism.</p>

Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> and others.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/2">The proposals on the retention of business rates represent a fundamental shift in the way in which local authorities are funded. They give councils a strong financial incentive to drive local economic growth. We will ensure that there is a stable starting point for the scheme so that no council is worse off as a result of its business rates base at its outset, and that will be achieved through a system of tariffs and top-ups that will be fixed in future years so that councils benefit from the growth of their business rates. Tariffs and top-ups will be uprated by inflation to ensure that a major part of authorities&#8217; top-up income under the scheme is not eroded in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/3">We have also proposed further protections to ensure that councils can meet local needs, including a safety net&#8212;I will directly deal with the specific question asked by the hon. Member for Warrington North later&#8212;that will be funded by a levy that recovers a share of any disproportionate gain from growth. The safety net will help to ensure that service provision does not suffer as a result of any volatility in a council&#8217;s business rates base. We announced that we intended to set the safety net threshold at a level between 7.5% and 10%, with the proportional levy ratio at 1:1, subject to consultation. That consultation took place over the summer; it has now ended, and we will consider the responses that we received before we take a final decision for this year&#8217;s settlement.</p>

I record my thanks to him for the fantastic work he did in bringing the Bill to the point at which I inherited it. He gave a great speech outlining some of the thoughts underlying the Bill and answering a great number of questions from Members to help everybody in the House have a fuller and better understanding of where the Bill is coming from and therefore what it aims to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.2/6">Business rates retention changes the ground rules for local government and moves power back to where it should be. To pick up on a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase>, it effectively puts local money back with local people in local communities&#8212;local money for and by, to coin a phrase, local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.3/1">I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee. I would like to thank him for his courtesy in inviting me to the Select Committee on Monday, and I enjoyed talking through some of the issues that local councils face. He tempts me to move outside the scope of the amendments, and I think the Deputy Speaker has made clear his views on their scope, but I will expand a little further on pooling without being tempted too far outside the terms of the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/2">Pooling gives councils a new tool to support economic growth across their area and greater ability to invest in the things that will have a greater impact on economic growth. As has been noted, the more the money comes together, the bigger its multiplier effect&#8212;the leveraging&#8212;can be. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made a comparison between this and the debate earlier this week on pension schemes, and how,</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/3">by bringing that money together and build it up into bigger pots, it can have a much more beneficial impact on local areas. That is why it is important that we allow councils to support economic priorities that have a benefit across a wider area. We are allowing councils better to weather any downturns in business rates income by sharing fluctuations in those rates. I will come back to the issue of a particular business.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/4">It is worth local authorities looking at and thinking through the effects of pooling, which will give them greater resilience and greater buying power and allow greater economic growth. I encourage local authorities to consider it, and they have until <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-09">9 November</phrase> to submit proposals. Earlier this year we had more than 20 expressions of interest from authorities. I stress that pooling is wholly voluntary but in terms of resilience, buying power and the ability to grow, I encourage councils to look carefully at it.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/5">We heard queries about whether pools may cross county boundaries and whether they must be linked geographically or in any other way. In the true spirit of localism, it is for councils themselves to determine the make-up of a pool. They will not be restricted to pooling within a county boundary, allowing rates retention to support the priorities of local enterprise partnerships where this is what councils want.</p>

	<p pid="c.266.6/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point and I am pleased that he had the chance to make that succinct intervention. An important by-product of business rates pooling is the opportunity for local authorities to look across the piece at whether they can pool to give themselves greater resilience, to look at the other funds that they can bring in, including the new homes bonus, and to look at their local enterprise partnership, their Portas money and any city deals that they might have, and how they can pull these things together, so that those authorities can work together to supercharge the opportunity to be part of local economic growth and to drive it from their local perspective.</p>

	<p pid="c.267.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very interesting suggestion. As I said, there is no county boundary restriction on local authorities working together. One of the more imaginative things that we are seeing in local government generally is that authorities are not delineated by their geographic boundaries. We have seen, for example, the excellent shared services and other work between South Holland and Breckland district council, which do not share a geographic boundary but have found a way of working together. Such arrangements are possible and councils should looking for such interesting and exciting opportunities to work together.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.1/2">We have, however, said that there should be a clear rationale for the geographic coverage of a pool if councils are to work together. It is important that councils have the flexibility to do what is right for them. That has worked well in local enterprise partnerships, on which a number of speakers have commented this afternoon. One of the reasons that LEPs are gaining such support and will be such a long-term success and powerhouse is that they have not been artificially designed and drawn on a map by people in Whitehall. They have come about as a result of communities, business organisations and local authorities coming together to decide what works for them and their community.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.1/3">Some interesting structures have developed. For example, in my part of the world, Great Yarmouth, the New Anglia partnership crosses the county boundary between Norfolk and Suffolk. It focuses much of its time on the energy industry across Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. It goes further in that it does not pick just one piece of land as its enterprise zone. It has a number of different sites because that is what the local business people, communities and local authorities coming together thought would work best for them. That is showing success already.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.1/4">Councils can choose whether they join a business rates pool, with all the benefits that that brings, during each reset period. Enterprise zones are different. In interventions and speeches, Members have asked about opportunities for pooling and whether that will lead, in effect, to mini-enterprise zones. It is worth noting that there is effectively the opportunity for local authorities to create&#8212;I think the Secretary of State has used the phrase&#8212;enterprise zone-lites by putting many of the opportunities that enterprise zones offer into local areas to drive growth, but enterprise zones differ in respect of pooling. Enterprise zones, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40507" name="Jake Berry">the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase>&#8212;he is no longer in his place&#8212;rightly pointed out, offer a wider and longer-term series of benefits because they run over 25 years and receive additional funds from the Treasury. Councils, working with their local partners, will need to consider what is right for their local areas. If they can do that, together with pooling, as I said in my opening remarks, they will see some real benefits for supercharging their economic growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.0/1">Will my hon. Friend have a word with our colleagues in the Treasury about the design of some fiscal policies that are based on regional boundaries, such as the national insurance holiday, which disadvantage those on the wrong side? For instance, Peterborough was at a disadvantage compared with, say, Corby or the south of Lincolnshire because it was in a different county and region. There was an obvious disincentive for businesses to consider Peterborough, based on that fiscal change.</p>

I think that we share the same philosophy in these matters. He made an important point about pooling, for which I am grateful, and there are some other issues that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40390" name="George Hollingbery">the Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery)</phrase> raised. As I understand it, the key element in Lords amendment 1, which deals with my hon. Friend&#8217;s point, is that the Government have undertaken to fund the discretionary rate relief in relation to enterprise zones so that there is not the disincentive to have an enterprise zone that there might otherwise be. Will he indicate that that is the way the rate relief will be delivered so that we can be sure that it is worth while for a local authority to have an enterprise zone without prejudicing the benefits of rate retention?</p>

	<p pid="c.268.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and hope that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will allow me 30-seconds leeway to thank him for his kind words. This is the first time I have been at the Dispatch Box during a debate in which he, who he is a good friend, has spoken, so I want to put on the record how fortunate I am to be following in the footsteps of someone who laid so clear a path, and one that I support and agree with. Equally, that offers a challenge, because I have quite an act to follow. As in all the matters we are discussing this afternoon, he is absolutely right that enterprise zones are structured in that way so that there is no such disincentive. It is important to bear in mind how the incentives work. Business rates retention offers local authorities a clear incentive to help drive growth, because they will benefit from all the growth they see. That is something we very much want to see so that local authorities are absolutely at the heart of driving economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.3/2">I will turn now to some of the question hon. Members asked. The hon. Member for Warrington North asked what happens when a major business goes down mid year, a point <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40302" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase> also touched on. The payments to major precepting authorities would be set on the basis of estimates of income made by the billing authority. Those payments will not change, so billing authorities might need to consider how they would fund any shortfall in the short term before the safety net calculations are made.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.4/1">Will the Minister explain how a billing authority would fund a shortfall of 20% in its business rate income?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.269.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" speakername="Brandon Lewis" colnum="269"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0002.htm#12103160001790">
	<p pid="c.269.0/1">I must stress that that is the approach the Local Government Association wanted and has been pushing for. It is also linked to the operation of the safety net more generally if a business has a problem mid-year. The draft regulations we published last week envisage that safety net calculations and payments being made after the end of the financial year, and safety net payments on account to be made where the authority thinks, on the basis of its estimates before the start of the year, that its rates income will be less than the threshold. The draft does not currently propose for authorities to be able to apply during the year for a safety net payment on account, in line with the clear views of our local government finance working group. These regulations are out to consultation in draft, and we look forward to receiving comments and will obviously feed back.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/2">The hon. Member for Warrington North also commented on the discrepancy, as she perceives it, between some of the Bill&#8217;s clauses and the situation with regard to the Audit Commission. I was somewhat flabbergasted, because I think that she might have been trying to argue for retaining the Audit Commission, but this is a transitional phase. It seems amazing to suggest delaying parts of the Bill or not having the clause that will allow it to move forward in dealing with that side of the Audit Commission, because the Bill is about driving growth of about &#163;10 billion. To do something because of her views on the Audit Commission seems very short-sighted for our economy, so she will excuse us if we resist that.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/3">I will turn to the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, who made a powerful and clear speech in which she talked about town and parish councils working together. On the technical side of her point, I point out that parish councils raise their own cash with their precept; they are funded not through the money raised by business rates, but directly through council tax. We feel that it is right that the district billing authorities receive funds from business rates as they are the key local drivers of growth. However, I want to stress that I feel clearly&#8212;this has been reflected in the comments made by several hon. Members this afternoon&#8212;that they should work with all bodies that can support growth, including parish councils, and will be involved in some areas in the potential for growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/4">We have worked with the Local Government Association, the National Association of Local Councils, with which I had a good meeting earlier this week, other organisations and parties in the other place throughout the passage of the Bill, and I would like to thank all parties that have been involved in feeding into it. It is also important to note that there is a range of measures for driving economic growth at community level, which provides parish councils with a particular opportunity to get involved. There are community budgets, neighbourhood planning, the right to build, the right to challenge, and the community share scheme, all of which will play a huge part.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole&#8212;I know that parish councils are close to her heart&#8212;will have noted that only today we announced formally the measures to make it easier to establish new parish, town and community councils, which I think is an important step forward, working with local communities, to offer the opportunity for more people to get involved</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/6">and to be part of their local community. Their local council at parish, district, county, unitary and metropolitan level will be part of driving economic growth, which is at the heart of the move forward with the business rates retention scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.0/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> spoke clearly about the power and ability of LEPs and touched on Lord Heseltine&#8217;s report, which highlights exactly where LEPs and local enterprise zones have a huge part to play. As I have said, the business rates retention scheme makes a fundamental shift in the way local authorities are funded. It will give councils a strong financial incentive to be part of driving local economic growth.</p>

I welcome his decision to choose this moment to start that debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.1/2">What I think is important in business rates retention and the way it moves the goalposts and the way local councils work is that it is really starting to shift back to what local authorities always want&#8212;I know this from my time as a council leader&#8212;which is to have their hands on the purse strings and the ability to have a direct impact on the amount of money they can bring in. They want more direct control over the way they work, their decisions, the way they develop the local economy and community and the way they involve the community. Local authorities will see a financial benefit and will be able to use that income to provide even more benefits for their communities and residents, and perhaps they will also use it to keep council tax down and, in so doing, further develop the work the Government are rightly doing through the council tax freezes we have brought in over the past few years. This is a very important step forward, and we are pleased that local government seems to be enthused by it. We hope that it motivates them towards growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.1/3">We are looking at the consultation results that we have received, and we will return to them later this year. We are setting out a whole new framework in which local government can work and where it becomes part of driving its local economy. That is not only a key part of how it shapes its community; it means that it can benefit from the advantages and growth that it sees in that community. The community will see that the local authority is benefiting in that way, and we will get a positive circle that can only be good for our communities, for our residents, and for economic growth in our country.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.3/1">Amendment 3 was moved in the other place by my noble Friend Baroness Hollis of Heigham. It calls for one very simple thing: a review of how the new system for council tax support is working three years after the Bill as enacted comes into effect. We tabled amendment (a) to make clear the original intention of the amendment in applying only to England because this is a devolved matter in Wales. When my noble Friend introduced the amendment in the Lords, she made a clear and persuasive case that was supported by a good majority.</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/2">The Government opposed the measure at the time, but I understand that they may now decide to accept it; the Minister will tell us. Opposition Members may wonder why that is, but in fact, we know why. The Government know that their policy on council tax is a shambles. It is so bad that they cannot even convince their own Members to support it. Their councils in North Yorkshire, including the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s council, have campaigned against its unfairness. The departmental Secretary of State&#8217;s own county council says that it has major implications for some of the most vulnerable members of the community. West Oxfordshire, the Prime Minister&#8217;s council, has refused to implement any scheme at all and will rely on the default scheme. Westminster, the Tories&#8217; flagship local authority, which we hear so much about, says that it will not implement it because residents are already adversely affected by changes to local housing allowance and other benefit cuts. This is what Westminster said in one of the documents that it submitted:</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/3">&#8220;The previous Community Charge (Poll Tax) experience shows that there are inherent difficulties in asking benefit claimants to pay small sums of Council Tax. This can make the debt difficult, and in some cases uneconomical, to collect.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/4">It also says:</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/5">&#8220;A decision to pass on the funding cut to claimants would be a reputational risk for the Council, as residents will perceive the cut as a local authority decision (rather than a central government given benefit cut).&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.271.4/1">In their consultations, Tameside suggested that it would need to make &#163;3.575 million of savings, while Stockport said that it will &#163;2.4 million of savings in relation to any new council tax support scheme. If Stockport or Tameside applied for and were eligible for the DCLG&#8217;s support mechanism, Tameside would get only &#163;460,379 and Stockport &#163;385,550. This is so unfair.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.5/1">Indeed; my hon. Friend is exactly right. I will want to return to those issues later.</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/2">What is happening, of course, is that councils that are better off with fewer claimants can afford to subsidise the scheme, while others cannot. I have quoted Westminster, the flagship Tory local authority, and that is before we even move on to what the Government&#8217;s noble Friends in the Lords say. Last week Lord Jenkin was asked by the BBC whether there were echoes of the poll tax in this proposal. He said, &#8220;Yes, oh yes&#8221;&#8212;and after all, he should know, as he was the architect of the poll tax. When he warns the Government of the risk of backlash, they should listen, because he knows what happened last time. The late Lord Newton of Braintree&#8212;not, by anyone&#8217;s standards, a woolly liberal&#8212;is recorded as having said in the Lords last year:</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/3">&#8220;Is it sane?...I can hardly believe my ears&#8221;.&#8212;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-10-06">6 October 2011</phrase>; Vol. 730, c. GC377.]</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/4">These are the Government&#8217;s allies, let us remember, and if they are aware of the problems it is no wonder the Government are now thinking about a review.</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/5">The Liberal Democrats&#8212;those of them who are here&#8212;should listen to Lord Greaves, the architect of many of their by-election victories, who told the <i>Lancashire Telegraph</i> that the scheme was &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; and told the <i>Financial Times</i> that it was</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/6">&#8220;the poll tax all over again.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/7">How far have the Lib Dems fallen that the party of Lloyd George is now voting for Pickles&#8217; poll tax?</p>
	<p pid="c.271.5/8">No wonder the Government are trying to find a way out of the mess they have created. No wonder they have decided not only that a review might be a good idea but to bring in some transitional relief as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.1/1">Labour Front Benchers believe in a fair deal for vulnerable people wherever in the country they happen to live, and we do not believe that a disabled person in Wokingham should be treated differently from a disabled person in Wigan. Our principle is that the help that someone gets should be dependent on their situation, not on where they happen to live. That is a key part of our policy. Let me say this to the hon. Lady: this is a policy designed to hit the poorest people hardest, especially the poorest people who happen to live in the poorest local authorities, which have already taken the biggest cuts in spending power, as we have seen during the passage of the Bill. Let us remember the figures. Liverpool will have lost &#163;235 per person in spending power. In Hartlepool, the figure is &#163;183. In Wokingham&#8212;I could not resist mentioning it just once more in the context of this Bill&#8212;it is a grand total of &#163;1.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.2/1">I put it to my hon. Friend that we may well have disagreement between individual Members, and possibly even parties, about whether it is a localist measure to devolve council tax benefit to local authorities or whether it is sensible to have a national benefit, but no one who is sensible, looking at this, can possibly agree that it is proper and right to make a 10% arbitrary cut in the</p>
	<p pid="c.272.2/2">amount of money available for such people at the time that the system is being decentralised. That is what is utterly objectionable and what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon.

	<p pid="c.273.0/1">My right hon. Friend is right. The reduction in the money available for council tax benefit is not the only thing that we are dealing with. The very same councils will be hit by the Government scheme for business rate localisation before being hit again by the reduction in the amount available for council tax. The Government call it a 10% cut, but in fact it is much more than that, because their calculations are based on what they think the cost of council tax benefit payments will be next year. It is no surprise to hon. Members who have followed the Bill&#8217;s passage through Parliament to learn that the Government believe that the cost will go down. In fact, the number of claims is rising as more people face reduced hours of work or unemployment. The Government have produced a wonderful document, which could have been written by Pollyanna, stating that claims will go down because the number of people on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance will go down and pensioner take-up will decline and so on. That is nonsense.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.2/1">I say to the hon. Gentleman that the one thing we would not do is target the poorest and most vulnerable for cuts at the same time as giving a tax cut to millionaires. The Government&#8217;s priorities are entirely wrong.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.3/1">Surely one thing we could do is agree with Birmingham council&#8217;s proposal to defer the plan for at least one year, so that the transitional arrangements can be properly worked out and places such as Birmingham will not end up losing about &#163;10 million, which no fair-minded person would believe was the deliberate intention.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. During the passage of the Bill we have repeatedly tabled amendments asking for the measure to be deferred, but the Government have always turned them down. His figures are right, too: Birmingham will lose more than &#163;10 million, Manchester almost &#163;5 million, Liverpool &#163;6.1 million, Haringey &#163;3.8 million and Cherwell &#163;747,000. The poorest authorities are losing more money overall, have more claimants and are therefore less likely to be able to make up the shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="c.273.4/2">As I have said, a person&#8217;s entitlement will no longer depend on their position&#8212;it will depend on where they live. An unemployed person in Peterborough will be treated differently from an unemployed person in Portsmouth, and a disabled person in Wokingham will be treated differently from a disabled person in Wigan. That is why this is a wrong-headed policy that will need review and, when we get to that review, the policy&#8217;s ill-effects will be all too apparent.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.0/1">My hon. Friend is being incredibly generous in giving way. I have mentioned the &#163;3.575 million that the Tameside council scheme will lose. That comes on top of the council&#8217;s delivery of &#163;43 million of savings in 2010-11 and 2011-12 and &#163;22 million of savings this year, and it estimates a further &#163;70.4 million of savings over the next three years.

	<p pid="c.274.1/1">My hon. Friend makes his point eloquently. The Government have always failed to acknowledge not only that this policy affects the same economies again and again, but that it has a devastating effect on local attempts to grow their economy. The very people who are losing money are those who went out and spent money in local shops and businesses, because, by the very nature of their low incomes, they have to spend everything they get. Councils are now faced with the most awful decisions and the people being hit hardest are people with disabilities, their carers and, most of all, the working poor&#8212;the people who this Government try to pretend do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.1/2">We all remember the former Housing Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, telling a Select Committee that if someone was working they would not get council tax benefit, because they would not need it. He did not believe that people who were in work received council tax benefit. He did not believe in the existence of those 743,000 people who are on non-passported council tax benefit and are in work. I admit that I sometimes find it difficult to believe in the existence of the right hon. Gentleman, because he has so many different identities&#8212;I often wonder whether he is an internet marketing guru masquerading as a member of the Government&#8212;but those working people on low incomes are certainly there and cannot be ignored.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.1/3">Among the options that councils are consulting on are: paying no award less than &#163;5 a week; restricting awards to the cost for a band D and, in some cases, even a band A property; restricting awards between 80% and 90% of value; increasing the taper; and abolishing the second adult rebate. The list goes on and it gets worse. One council&#8212;Tendring&#8212;is proposing residency criteria, so that people will only become eligible for support if they have lived in the district for five years. If someone moves there for work&#8212;after all, the Government want people to move for work&#8212;and happens to lose their job, hard luck: they will not get a penny. Those of us who know our history will recognise that proposal immediately for what it is. It is a reinstitution of the Poor Law&#8212;if someone needs relief, they should move back to their own parish, or in this case their own borough. On that basis, I wonder whether the Government live in the 21st or the 18th century.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.1/4">It is no wonder that the Government have introduced a &#163;100 million transitional relief fund. There is no better proof of the shambles that they are in than the fact that they have made that announcement after local authorities have begun consultations on their schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a very important point. This should not come as a surprise to the Government. The Communities and Local Government Committee inquiry reported in September 2011, and in the report we drew attention to the problems at that time with the time scale, the difficulties with implementation and the unintended consequences. We asked the</p>
	<p pid="c.274.2/2">Government to consider a delay in order to allow more time for everything to happen. Their only response has been to complicate matters even further with a &#163;100 million offer right at the last minute and in the middle of a consultation process. Could there be a more cack-handed way of running a policy?</p>

	<p pid="c.275.0/1">I am tempted to say to my hon. Friend, who is the distinguished Chair of the Committee, that I cannot think of a more cack-handed policy, but then again this Government constantly surprise us by coming up with something more cack-handed than we had ever thought of. He is right about the problems with the transitional relief fund. Councils have begun consultation on their schemes, but now the Government want them redesigned to qualify for a transitional grant. Their conditions include the requirement that those currently receiving 100% relief should pay no more than 8.5% of tax, that the taper does not increase above 25%, and that there is no sharp decline in support for people entering work. Having embarked on a system that they insisted should rest on local decision making, they are now dictating how the scheme should be designed.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.0/2">Even so, that does not solve the problems. There is no legal clarity on whether councils will now have to consult again on these new schemes. Could the Minister give councils some advice about that? There is no indication of how, if they have to do another consultation, its cost will be met, and there is still a &#163;400 million funding gap, even according to the Government&#8217;s own figures.</p>

	<p pid="c.275.2/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. It is not sufficient to bridge the funding gap. It seems from the indicative amounts that my own local authority will get back &#163;320,000, including money for the police and fire authority precepts, but lose &#163;1.3 million. Birmingham will get back &#163;2.4 million out of &#163;10 million, Manchester &#163;1.1 million out &#163;5 million, Liverpool nearly &#163;1.5 million out of &#163;6.1 million and Haringey &#163;888,000 out of &#163;3.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.2/2">Those councils are caught in a dilemma once again. If they adopt the Secretary of State&#8217;s scheme, there will still be a huge funding gap, and how will it be met? It would be difficult under the Government&#8217;s scheme to meet it through cuts to council tax benefits for other claimants of working age, pensioners are protected and there is a limit on the council tax rises that local authorities can introduce, so the only alternative is cuts in services. Yet local authorities that are already managing to fund the shortfall will now get a windfall. Westminster will get &#163;318,000 and West Oxfordshire &#163;116,000. That is not transitional relief for local councils, it is emergency relief for Conservative councillors facing the electorate next May.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.4/1">My right hon. Friend is entirely right. I suspect that if a council found itself in financial difficulty and did not have reserves, Ministers would be the first to stand up and accuse it of failing to plan prudently for that eventuality.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/2">The scheme will last only one year. Will schemes have to be redesigned again after that? If so, people will have had to cope with three different council tax benefit systems in three years. Currently, they might pay nothing, but next year they might pay 8.5%. After that, who knows&#8212;15%, 20%, 30%? There is huge uncertainty for the poorest people in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/3">As my right hon. Friend says, local councils will also be left with huge financial uncertainty. The Government believe that the number of pensioners claiming council tax benefit will drop, but everyone who deals with benefits believes that it will rise, because in future the sum in question will be shown as a reduction in someone&#8217;s council tax bill rather than a separate benefit. If unemployment goes up in an area, if a major employer closes down or if there are increases in part-time working, as there have been recently, local authorities will bear all the financial risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.6/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. One problem with the system that the Government are introducing is that people will face two tests for benefits, possibly with two different tapers. For someone in the universal credit pilot, it will have to be decided whether the council tax benefit taper is applied before or after the universal credit taper. That clearly has not been thought through.</p>

	<p pid="c.277.0/1">That is not the only complication, of course. An individual whose income has changed and who has difficulties will now face the problem of going to the local council offices to sort out their council tax benefit, then going to the Department for Work and Pensions&#8212;either at the office if they can get there, or online or over the telephone&#8212;to sort out their housing benefit changes.

	<p pid="c.277.1/1">Absolutely right, and because of that there is real doubt among local authorities about whether they can collect payments from people who have never had to pay anything before and simply will not have the money to pay. Treasurers are predicting collection rates of only about 40% or 50%, and local authorities predict huge deficits because of the likelihood that they will not collect most of the money. What, then, are local authorities to do? Will they take people to court when they know that they do not have the money to pay? That would carry a huge cost to recover a small sum of money.</p>

	<p pid="c.278.2/3">I have been reading the Minister&#8217;s blog; it is very entertaining and I recommend it to my hon. Friends as it is a treasure trove of Tory doublethink. The Minister begins by repeating the usual mantra that if someone is not in work, it is their own fault. He states that too many people</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/4">&#8220;expect to be able to rely on benefits and those who are hard at work are starting to get the hump.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/5">Let me say to him that 1,540 people in Great Yarmouth might start to get the hump with him because they are employed and in receipt of council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/6">There are others. Will the Minister tell his disabled constituents, the vast majority of whom would like nothing better than to have a job, why they face an increase in their council tax? The Government trumpet their council tax freeze while imposing council tax rises on the poorest people in the country. When the Minister next visits a group of carers in his constituency&#8212;people who do daily the things that most of us could not imagine doing, and who save the country millions of pounds every year&#8212;will he say why their reward is an increase in council tax?</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/7">Elsewhere on his blog, the Minister writes that</p>
	<p pid="c.278.2/8">&#8220;the sign of a compassionate country and a modern democracy is how it caters for those who are most vulnerable.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.278.4/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. We have said throughout discussions on this Bill that it is about centralising power and devolving the blame&#8212;after all, Tory-run Westminster council recognises that. That is the test the Minister set for his Government&#8212;the sign of a compassionate society in a modern democracy&#8212;but I am afraid the Government have failed that, and failed some of the poorest, most vulnerable people in our society. Benefits for people who are disabled will no longer depend on their disability, but on where they happen to live. We are talking about people who are sacrificing their careers to look after members of their family who are ill or disabled, and those who go</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/2">out to work every week for poverty wages, because they believe that working&#8212;when they can work&#8212;is the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.4/3">The Government seek to stigmatise those people as scroungers and they should hang their head in shame. Those people are doing the right thing, contributing to society and doing their best on a low income. The amounts they are being asked to pay may not seem much to people on the Government Benches, but to an individual or family living on the edge, they are unobtainable. Every penny they have is accounted for and there is nothing left for emergencies. To try and find even a couple of pounds at the end of the week is out of the question; it is just not there. That is why council treasurers are expecting to collect only 40p in every &#163;1, and why we risk a repeat of the poll-tax fiasco, when thousands of people left the electoral register to try and avoid the tax, and 5,000 people went to prison.</p>

By the time we get to the review, it is likely that the Ministers who introduced these measures will have moved on. The poorest and most vulnerable people, however, will still be paying the price.

	<p pid="c.280.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is getting very worked up again, but may I remind him that, when his Government took office, the economy was growing and unemployment was falling? If he calls that a failure, what does he call the longest double-dip recession since the war?</p>

	<p pid="c.280.5/1">I call the greatest deficit in our peacetime history a failure. The benefits system that Labour created was so confusing and complex&#8212;it has some 32 different benefits in it&#8212;that it is virtually impossible for anyone to navigate it. I call that a failure. I call the fact that spending on council tax benefit doubled over the 13 years of the Labour Government a failure, because they did not achieve what should have been the objective of aiding people back into work. Some of my constituents have not known the opportunity of work for three generations. I call that a failure. The suggestion that the Labour party did anything other than fail is a bogus one. No amount of rhetoric and high-flown words can hide that reality.</p>
	<p pid="c.280.5/2">We have not heard from Labour Members what they would do about the problem. They have made not a single constructive suggestion.</p>

What would they do to reform the system to increase the incentives to get people who are unemployed into work? What would they do to ensure that, when people move into work, the loss of benefit is not too great a disincentive? Our transitional scheme seeks to deal with that, but what would they do?

	<p pid="c.281.2/2">I put it to the hon. Gentleman that he is complaining not about rhetoric&#8212;we have heard quite a lot of his rhetoric&#8212;but about the experience of Members of Parliament who know from their constituencies that very large numbers of people will be badly hit by the measures, and will suffer hardship, deprivation and poverty as a result of them.

	<p pid="c.281.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman is always touchy when his Government&#8217;s record is called into question, but he must learn to live with that, because his record is questionable. The simple truth is that the Labour Government&#8217;s doubling of spending on council tax benefit is not a success; it is a mark of failure. I have heard not one word on what Labour Members would do to redress the situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.3/2">I am relaxed about whether there is a review. The provisions of the Bill require local authorities, at local level, to keep their schemes under review. I am confident that a national review would demonstrate that the measure is necessary. Not a word has been said by Labour Members about how they would make good the funding gap that would be left if nothing were done. There is nothing from them about that. It is like the old prayer that is adopted&#8212;&#8220;Lord make me virtuous, but not yet.&#8221; They say they want to reduce the deficit, but they will not tell us when or how they will do so. Failing to reduce the deficit damages the underlying economy, real and sustainable growth, and the prospect of real and sustainable jobs for the very people about whom they claim to be concerned. Locking people into a massively complicated benefits system, which they created, is not helping&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i> Labour Members&#8217; laughter demonstrates the air of unreality that hovers over them. They will not accept their responsibility. They behave like ostriches. To paraphrase the late George Carman QC, they prefer to put their heads in the sand, thereby revealing their thinking parts.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is nothing compassionate about that. The attitude of Labour Members is blinkered&#8212;to put it as charitably as I can. They think the only way to deal with people compassionately is by continuing with a rigid and failed system.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.1/1">For a split millisecond, the hon. Gentleman had me sold on the idea that he was convinced about a simplified benefits system. If he is convinced, why does he believe council tax benefit should not be part of the universal credit system? The proposals will result in a different council tax benefit system for every local authority area in the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.282.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="282"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0002.htm#12103160001850">
	<p pid="c.282.2/1">The hon. Gentleman, whom I respect in these matters, makes an interesting point. I have two points to make in response. First, we consulted prior to the design of the system, and one question that came up is whether we should include council tax benefit in the universal credit. The cross-party local authority associations did not want that, which we reflected in the Bill. That was their view at the time and I still believe they were right. We adopted a localist stance, and we need take no lessons on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.2/2">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman says there will be different approaches in different areas, but I should gently tell him that he betrays the error of the Labour party&#8217;s thinking. Labour Members take a monolithic approach, but local economic circumstances, the demands on people who are not in work, and the demand that they place on council budgets, vary from place to place. The whole point of localising the scheme is to recognise that local authorities are generally better placed than a monolithic and centrally administered scheme to recognise the particular influences on the jobs market and routes back into work in different places.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on the work he put into the Bill, which is a worthwhile contribution to localism. Does he agree that one great virtue of localism is that it gives elected local authorities the opportunity to inculcate their values in the local community? Tendring council might have values it wants to promote in the context of the legislation, but socialist local authorities might want to implement more socialism locally.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Labour Members&#8217; approach is bizarre. They claim to be localist but object when anything is localised. They claim to recognise the need to reduce the deficit&#8212;I am never quite sure about that&#8212;but never actually say how or when they would do it. Instead, they just give a blanket criticism of anything that seeks to move things forward.</p>

The ability to design schemes in different ways is, and should be, a local choice. It is strange that there should be any objection to that. The Government have provided help, of course, and not only through the transitional scheme, which I regard not as a mark of weakness but as a mature and sensible reflection on how to proceed in a constructive way. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Again, that sense of unreality wafts across from the Opposition Benches.

	<p pid="c.283.3/1">We did some very sensible and mature things a year ago: we paid out &#163;30 million upfront to assist with the design of the scheme; we gave early notice of our statement of intent; we enabled local authorities to run their consultations early while the secondary legislation was going through; and we listened to suggestions for further refinements, such as ensuring that the taper works smoothly so that it eases people back into work as their income rises. The Government should be congratulated on taking all that on board, not criticised, but that is not going to happen, of course, such is the Opposition&#8217;s unreal mindset. They seem to have locked themselves into a closed way of thinking.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/2">What is the best way of getting people back into the labour market? How do we deal with the fraud that, I regret to say, is an issue with some benefits? The vast majority of benefit claimants act honestly and properly, but significant sums are, I am sorry to say, lost to fraud. That is far better dealt with locally, because local council officials and members have better local knowledge and are better linked to the various enforcement agencies. Significant savings for the honest and genuine claimant can be made through the better running of the scheme and by dealing with issues such as fraud, but those things are better dealt with locally.</p>

	<p pid="c.284.0/1">That is a sensible and useful point. As in our earlier discussion about pooling business rates, there is sense in pooling some of the critical mass and resource available between local authorities. Again, if we are trying to get people back into the job markets, which might span more than one local authority area, it is sensible for there to be a means for local authorities to work together.

	<p pid="c.284.3/1">The hon. Gentleman might remember from those days that I was involved, as an officer, in setting up the local fraud units, which were successful.

	<p pid="c.284.4/1">The point I take from the hon.

We have sensibly reflected on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.4/2">It is important that we get to grips with this intractable issue. Amendment (a) sounds innocuous, and if my hon. Friend the Minister advises the House to accept it, I would have no difficulty in doing so, but the Labour party has not tabled it out of an interest in carrying out a significant and worthwhile review.

	<p pid="c.284.5/1">I have heard a number of speeches by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, but that was probably the worst. There was a total failure to acknowledge any problem with the proposals we are debating this afternoon and an attempt to deflect blame elsewhere, rather than recognising that he has created something that will haunt him, his colleagues and all Members of Parliament, who from next April are likely to see large numbers of aggrieved constituents coming to ask why they suddenly have to pay sums of money that they do not have the means to pay. Then&#8212;this is an interesting point about the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s suggestion about fraud&#8212;when those constituents see that some councils will not pursue relatively small arrears, just because it is uneconomical to do so, they will probably think, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s probably no need for me to pay.&#8221; If ever something were likely to undermine the culture of payment and responsibility, it is this kind of scheme, in just the same way that the poll tax undermined the culture of paying because it was seen as unfair, because it was arbitrary and because the arrears that built up took an enormous amount of time to recover.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/2">All this is unnecessary. We can have a debate about whether council tax benefit should be localised. I have been happy to participate in that debate, and there are arguments both ways. There is an argument that council</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/3">tax benefit should be part of a universal credit and benefit system. There are also arguments about localisation. We can have those debates. I would have been happy to participate in an argument about that and to try to develop either a local or national scheme that worked and that met the objectives that had been articulated. However, that is not what we are debating this afternoon. This is a ham-fisted set of proposals, cooked up by the Government in a way that shows a complete lack of joined-up thinking between Departments&#8212;the Department for Communities and Local Government is going in a completely different way from the Department for Work and Pensions&#8212;and then imposed to a chaotic timetable.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/4">The way this House has handled the process is a cause for concern in itself. Our first debates about the Bill were in January, when the Committee stage was taken on the Floor of the House and had to be rushed through without adequate time to consider all the issues. Then the Bill was parked for three or four months. We heard nothing more about it. We wondered what was going on, until the penny dropped and one of the Clerks was wise enough to point out what was happening. The Government had suddenly realised that if they went through the parliamentary procedures, the Bill would fall with the end of the Session. They had to park it because they had not realised that the only way to get it through the current Session was not to take it through the House of Lords in the previous Session, so that they could then reintroduce it in this one.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/5">Here we are, less than six months before the implementation of a hugely complex scheme that will affect the benefit entitlement of around 4 million people nationally, without the details agreed and with an extraordinary series of last-minute adjustments, including the transitional relief. We could not devise such a chaotic implementation programme if we tried. I am really disappointed that Ministers have not acknowledged that this is a mess. The right way forward now is to say, &#8220;We need time to get it right.&#8221; Let us give them credit: let us give them the opportunity to say that localisation is the right thing to do, but then please let us recognise that this is not the right way to do it. We have to give local authorities sufficient time to prepare, consult and carry their communities with them. We have to give them the means to do that without these arbitrary cuts, which affect individuals so harshly and unfairly, because there will be marked differences between categories of people.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/6">Let us take the position of two households, one just over pension age and the other just under. Under the arrangements that are being introduced, if they both receive an equivalent amount of benefits, one group will be protected from any cuts because they are over pensionable age and the other will not. How will that be explained? How is there any sense of fairness whatever if those households&#8217; circumstances are broadly the same? There will be anomalies, problems and a sense of injustice on the part of the public, and then there will be all the administrative issues in trying to collect small sums of money. It cannot make sense to proceed in this rushed way towards what is likely to be serious administrative chaos in early spring next year. The sensible measure would have been to say, &#8220;We must take stock. We must now pause and try to get this right.&#8221; Even if the</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/7">Government will not accept that, they should at least confirm that there will be a review. It cannot be right to proceed with such a chaotic scheme that has gone through such a bad gestation period and that is now going to produce the kinds of problems that Members have articulated so well today, without a commitment to a thorough review.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.5/8">The other place did us a service by passing the amendment that would make a commitment to such a review, and the Government should, at the very least, accept that the measure must be reviewed independently and fairly; otherwise, we shall be condemning large numbers of our citizens to an unfair and harsh series of measures that will impact on their livelihoods and that they will find impossible to understand. The Government are committing local authorities to implementing harsh and unfair measures for which they will get quite a lot of the blame. The whole thing is a terrible mistake, and I just hope that the Government will now recognise that they have a serious responsibility to the public and to local authorities to try to make the best of the very unfortunate position that they have got themselves into.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.0/1">I will deal first with the points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>. I am still relatively new to the House, having joined in 2010, and I am certainly new to the Dispatch Box. I have to say that the opening remarks of his speech were the most undignified I have heard in this Chamber in my short time here. I therefore do not intend to comment further on what he had to say.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">The hon. Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> made a point about the scheme in general, and I shall respond to it directly. She seemed to suggest that her party would like to see a centrally controlled policy scheme, rather than trusting local councils. I must point out that the Local Government Association does not want this provision to be part of universal credit; it wants it to be localised, if it needs to change. I was disappointed that Labour Members seemed to lack trust and faith in local councils and local councillors to do what is right for their communities. We have far more trust and faith in them than Labour does.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/3">I was astounded to hear at least one Member complain that the Government&#8217;s pledge of a further &#163;100 million to help local authorities with the transition was unhelpful. That provision is of course voluntary; local councils do not need to take part and do not need to take up any of the money. It is simply a transitional grant that will be available if councils wish voluntarily to take up the offer of it. Some councils will come up with different schemes. It is part of localism that they will do what they think is right for their local communities. Some might have large reserves. If, for example, a council had about &#163;45 million in reserve, it might use some of that to prepare for the changes. The Government&#8217;s position is that that should be a local decision. This is about local councils having the political will to do the right thing, to look at what is right for their communities, and to work to develop economic growth to get more people off benefits and into work. That goes hand in hand with the business rate retention that we discussed earlier.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.1/1">It is important to record the fact that no Labour Member is saying that localism is a bad thing. The Minister cannot have it both ways, however.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.1/2">Either the Government take a localist approach, in which the arrangements for council tax benefit will be different from one local authority to another, or they do what the Minister says he wants to do, which is to simplify the system. That would involve one nationwide system.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.0/1">I am not quite sure what point the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. This is a localised scheme in which local councils will do what they want to do. Different councils are consulting on different schemes, and in response to some of the consultations the Government have made provision to allow local authorities some transitional money to help them to move to what might be a better scheme for their area. But&#8212;this is the key point&#8212;that money is part of a voluntary scheme. It is up to local authorities whether they take part in it, or whether they go ahead with what they believe is the right scheme for them.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.1/1">By the Minister&#8217;s own admission, then, this is not a simplified scheme. It is a localised scheme, but it is not simplified. Every local authority will have a different system in place, which will add to complexity.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.2/1">I think the hon. Gentleman is starting to understand that localism means that local councils can do what they think is right for their local communities, understanding that what might work in one local community would not necessarily be right in another local community in respect of the schemes they devise to secure economic growth, to create more jobs or to get more people off benefits in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.3/1">It is not an absolute certainty that localising council tax will indeed lead to fiendish complexities. It is entirely within the gift of local councils to negotiate among themselves to have council tax schemes grouped, which could then be agreed across, say, Hampshire. Given the commonality of economic prosperity in the area I represent, that would seem to make sense. Does the Minister agree?</p>

	<p pid="c.287.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I would add that there is a range of things for local councils to look at. Some local authorities will be looking to bear down on some of the fraud and error, which we believe is worth &#163;200 million a year. They will be looking to come up with schemes to drive economic growth, to put more people into work, to be more efficient. They might be looking at saving money through shared services in the management teams and various other schemes. The flexibilities we are putting in place give them a huge opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.4/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">The hon.

	<p pid="c.288.4/1">It is all down to local councils to decide, but one of the complications is that the Government are localising council tax benefit, but centralising housing benefit.

Are the Government to sort out this problem between the two Departments?</p>

	<p pid="c.288.5/1">I am sure we can take that back to the DWP, but I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that this goes some way outside the remit of the amendments. I will reflect on his comment and come back to him on it. As I have said, councils will have choices about how to meet the cost of support, and local authorities that have consulted on their proposals will need to consider whether they want to apply for the grant or whether they need to make changes to the proposed schemes in order to do that. I shall return to that issue in a few moments, if Members wish it.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/2">Let me deal with the specific amendments. I shall ask the House to agree to Lords amendment 3 and to the other Lords amendments, but to resist the Opposition amendments to the amendments, which I shall ask the hon. Member for Warrington North to withdraw.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/3">Lords amendment 3 requires the Secretary of State to provide for a review of council tax reduction schemes within three years of the Act coming into effect and sets out certain considerations for that review. As Baroness Hanham made clear in the House of Lords, Government routinely review policy and respond to ensure our objectives are met. The transitional grant scheme announced on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-16">16 October</phrase> was a direct response to those authorities that are proposing schemes that place what the Government consider to be an unacceptable burden on the very poorest. That is why we will accept that amendment, but we will not seek to overturn it.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/4">In accepting the principle that Government should keep policy under review, I would make a couple of points. The terms of the review, as set out in the amendment, do not bind the Government to any course of action as a result of the review&#8217;s recommendations. I know that the Local Government Association is keen for us to make that clear. We will need carefully to consider the findings of the review before considering how we will respond. We remain clear that localisation is our preferred policy. It strengthens incentives to support local growth and jobs, drive down fraud and</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/5">error and hold down council tax. It gives local authorities control over how to design support schemes, taking into account the impact on local populations and council tax collection rates. It also ensures that funding for council tax support is paid directly to the authorities that provide vital services. All those are important considerations that the Government would want to take into account in any future review.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/6">The Opposition&#8217;s amendments seek to ensure that such a review would apply only to England, but I believe that if the Secretary of State is required to review the operation of local schemes in England that are provided for under powers in this Bill, such a review should also take place in relation to schemes that are similarly provided for in Wales. Let me explain that further.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/7">Such schemes will be provided for under regulations to be introduced by Welsh Ministers, so it is right for Welsh Ministers to lead on any review. In complying with the requirement of the Lords amendment, the Secretary of State will therefore seek to agree with Welsh Ministers the scope and format of the review in relation to Wales. It will also be for Welsh Ministers to consider the implications of the review&#8217;s recommendations for the framework for schemes provided for through their regulations, and the powers provided, at their request, in the current Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/8">In the light of these assurances, I do not think that the Opposition&#8217;s amendments are necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/9">Lords amendments 83, 84 and 86 would enable regulations made by the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers about council tax reduction schemes of billing authorities in England or Wales to make provision equivalent to the provisions of, or the provisions that could be made under, sections 32 to 34 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007. The amendments would also give billing authorities in England power to make additional provision in their local scheme which replicates, or could be made under, those sections. The amendments would allow local authority schemes to provide for extended payments, which are an important way of supporting work incentives.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/10">Lords amendment 85 is a technical amendment. It is intended to ensure that the power in new paragraph 6 of schedule 1A to the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which allows major precepting and billing authorities to reach an agreement to vary payments or instalments that are required to be made under regulations about funds, applies&#8212;as was intended&#8212;only to regulations in relation to council tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/11">Lords amendments 87 to 90 would ensure that the expertise of members of the First-tier Tribunal could be used in the deciding of appeals against decisions made in relation to council tax reduction schemes. The amendment would enable First-tier Tribunal members to sit as members of the Valuation Tribunal for England at the request of the president of the tribunal, with the approval of the Senior President of Tribunals, and only in relation to appeals that relate in whole or in part to council tax reduction schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.5/12">I urge Members to agree to the Lords amendments and resist the Commons amendments, and invite the hon. Member for Warrington North to consider withdrawing amendment (a).</p>

	<p pid="c.295.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House takes note of European Union Documents No. 16844/11, No. 16845/11, No. 16846/11, No. 16847/11, No. 16848/11, No. 6708/12 and Addenda 1&#8211;3, No. 9007/12, No. 12356/12, and No. 13620/12, relating to the Commission&#8217;s proposal on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), 2014&#8211;2020; agrees with the Government that at a time of ongoing economic fragility in Europe and tight constraints on domestic public spending, the Commission&#8217;s proposal for substantial spending increases compared with current spend is unacceptable, unrealistic, too large and incompatible with the tough decisions being taken in the UK and in countries across Europe to bring deficits under control and stimulate economic growth; notes that UK contributions to the European Union budget have also risen in recent years due to the 2005 decision to give away parts of the UK rebate; agrees that the next MFF must see significant improvements in the financial management of EU resources by the Commission and by Member States and significant improvements in the value for money of spend; further agrees that the proposed changes to the UK abatement and proposals for new taxes to fund the EU budget are completely unacceptable and an unwelcome distraction from the pressing issues that the EU needs to address; and calls on the Government to seek significant savings to the Commission&#8217;s seven year framework, as set out in the Prime Minister&#8217;s joint letter with France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-18">18 December 2010</phrase>, which stated that &#8216;payment appropriations should increase, at most, by no more than inflation over the next financial perspectives&#8217;.</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/3">The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, is making a rapid getaway, but if he wants to deal with the motion, I shall not stand in his way.</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/4">It is a pleasure to have been sprung from the sometimes stormy world of planning policy into the calm and genteel discussions that characterise such European issues. The debate is, if nothing else, timely, given the forthcoming negotiations on the EU&#8217;s annual budget for 2013 and on the multiannual financial framework, which sets out budget ceilings for the seven years between 2014 and 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/5">When I became Financial Secretary last month, hon. Members can imagine the delight I felt to find that the EU negotiations were at the top of my in-tray. However, now that I have had a few weeks to immerse myself in the budgetary demands that have been made by not only the institutions of the EU, but several member states, I have to report that my normally cheerful mood has soured. Frankly, the sheer lack of shame displayed by those demanding more of our money is extraordinary. They want more at a time when the International Monetary Fund predicts that Government spending across the EU will fall by more than 8% between 2010 and 2017. They want more at a time when Mr Barroso, the European Commission&#8217;s President, has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/6">&#8220;public finances must be consolidated&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/7">and that</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/8">&#8220;sound public finances are needed to restore confidence that is so essential for growth&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.295.2/9">They are asking for more at a time when the Commission itself is forcing deep public spending cuts on member states that have the misfortune to be locked into a debt crisis. At just such a time, the European Commission has thought it reasonable to propose an increase in what the EU spends of more than &#8364;100 billion, which is 10% more than it spends already.</p>

	<p pid="c.296.0/1">In light of what my right hon.

	<p pid="c.296.3/1">Our position is that we want the EU budget to be cut, but part of the negotiating mandate that the Prime Minister has agreed is that the very most that we would accept would be a real-terms freeze. However, we want a cut, as I shall explain.</p>
	<p pid="c.296.3/2">The Commission&#8212;this time with the European Parliament&#8212;has proposed an increase of 6.8% for the 2013 annual budget. That is for a year in which the IMF forecasts that growth throughout Europe will average 0.5%. My view, and that of the Government, is that such a demand constitutes a grotesque imposition.</p>

	<p pid="c.296.5/1">I cannot confirm that, but I noted from the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s article in the <i>New Statesman</i> that he is calling for increases in the budget, especially for the structural funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.296.5/2">The Commission&#8217;s proposal is totally unacceptable, so let me say very clearly to hon. Members, as well as those around Europe who might be watching, that it is not happening. On the MFF, we will accept no real-terms increase in the EU budget for the next seven years. We will veto any proposal that either does not cut the budget, or does not at the very least freeze it for the whole of the period. There will be no more budgets that pursue ever closer union through ever higher spending.</p>

	<p pid="c.297.2/1">Let me make a bit of progress and then I shall, of course, give way to hon. Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.2/2">Our opposition to the demands of the Commission is more than a matter of headline figures alone. When we dig down into the detail, there is always something repellent to find. For example, let us consider the EU administration costs. Members may not be aware that the pay of employees within the EU bureaucracy increases automatically each year. There is, however, a sensible provision to set this aside at times of economic crisis yet, unbelievably, the EU Commission is taking the EU Council to court to insist that the EU is not experiencing a time of economic crisis and that pay should rise. This is the same Commission that has attended four ordinary and three emergency European Councils during the past 12 months to agree unprecedented measures to bail out member states which have been unable to fund themselves without help. So while some member states face a crisis of solvency, the institutions of the EU face a crisis of credibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.297.3/1">I welcome the right hon. Gentleman to his post. I have known him for a long time and he has always been a very good pro-European. One of the elements that determines how much Britain pays towards the EU is VAT. If we increase VAT in this country, it means that we pay more money to the EU. Can he tell us precisely how much more we are paying by virtue of the increase of VAT to 20%?</p>

	<p pid="c.297.4/1">The hon. Gentleman may have known me for a long time but he has a faulty memory. It was his Government&#8212;he served, I think, as Europe Minister in that Government&#8212;who gave away half of our rebate, which caused the increase that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.4/2">Though they are ready to lecture others on fiscal discipline, it is fiscal incontinence that characterises the approach of the European institutions. Administrative costs need to be hammered down to bring them into line with the modern world, yet the response of the Commission&#8217;s spokesman has been little short of insolent. The British Government asked the Commission to model cuts of &#8364;5 billion, &#8364;10 billion and &#8364;15 billion to its staffing budget, and the Commission refused. Its spokesman said:</p>
	<p pid="c.297.4/3">&#8220;We declined as it&#8217;s a lot of work and a waste of time for our staff who are busy with more urgent matters&#8230;we are better educated than national civil servants. We&#8217;re high fliers, not burger flippers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.4/4">As the Prime Minister has pointed out, one in every six of the Commission&#8217;s employees earns over &#8364;100,000 a year. The ordinary working people of this country have run out of patience with the attitude displayed by</p>
	<p pid="c.297.4/5">the Commission. The British public are ready to make sacrifices to put Britain back on its feet, but not to featherbed a self-styled elite and its agenda. We are not rolling back wasteful public spending in this country only to see it re-imposed from Brussels.</p>

The last time the country had the misfortune to be in the hands of a Labour Government, including the shadow Foreign Secretary, who was Europe Minister at the time, far from agreeing even a real-terms freeze or a cut, they increased the budget over seven years by 8%. That is the record of the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/2">It is not just the overall total. Once more we see the usual suspects circling round Britain&#8217;s budget rebate. That rebate was secured for future generations by Margaret Thatcher at Fontainebleau&#8212;the rebate which Tony Blair and his Europe Minister, the shadow Foreign Secretary, put on the table in 2005, in the negotiation of the current multiannual financial framework. Of course, when I say negotiation, what I mean is unconditional surrender, giving away in perpetuity a large part of the rebate in return for nothing. If seven days is a long time in politics, seven years is even longer. The amendment to the motion would delete all mention of this betrayal. The act would be forgotten, but the consequences have not gone away.</p>

	<p pid="c.298.2/1">The position of the Opposition is truly incredible, given their record in government. However, the problem that the good people of Brigg and Goole have with the multiannual financial framework is that all we can do is hope for a freeze as potentially the best outcome. Does that not show just how much the European Union has managed to take away the sovereignty of this country?</p>

	<p pid="c.298.3/1">Every budget negotiation under the seven-year framework has resulted in an increase. That must now stop. The next seven years must see an end to the perpetual ratcheting up of EU spending. The Prime Minister will be looking to achieve precisely that. As far as the Government are concerned, what remains of the rebate, after the predations of the Labour party, is absolutely non-negotiable. That means that even talking about it is a waste of time. Without it, our net contribution would be by far the largest in the EU, twice as big as that of France and more than one and a half times that of Italy or Germany as a percentage of gross national income.</p>

Those sitting on the Opposition Front Bench are the same men who gave away so much of our rebate and who would surely surrender the rest on demand to curry favour with Europe. It is the party that, the last time it was in power and had the opportunity to negotiate an MFF, agreed not to a cut or a freeze, but to an 8% real-terms increase. It is a party whose socialist comrades in the European Parliament declared that the Commission&#8217;s proposed 10% increase was</p>
	<p pid="c.299.5/3">&#8220;not sufficient to finance all the EU&#8217;s objectives&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.299.5/4">It is a party that nearly bankrupted our country but now claims conversion to the rigours of fiscal rectitude. It is a party whose last act in office was to sign Britain up to the EU stabilisation mechanism when it did not ever have a mandate to govern. It is a party that is so caught up in its cynical political games that it calls for a cut in the budget but at the same time says we should not deploy our veto to secure Britain&#8217;s interests. It is not a party that deserves to be taken seriously, as its opportunistic posturing this week shows.</p>

	<p pid="c.299.7/1">One of the issues that I hope unites Members of this House is a reflection that the structural funds need to be cut.

	<p pid="c.300.0/1">Although it might be popular on the Government Benches, I think that the country is getting sick and tired of Eurosceptic words from Ministers but very little action on the ground.

If I am incorrect, will the Financial Secretary please correct me on the record?</p>

	<p pid="c.300.1/1">The shape of the budget needs to be negotiated&#8212;it has not been settled yet&#8212;but it is true to say that as a result of the giveaway of the rebate that the previous Government introduced we lose out from spending that goes to the new member states that previously would have been abated.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/2">Let me address the three main differences between the motion and the amendment. First, the amendment would remove the condemnation of the previous Government for giving away part of our rebate. Despite the talk of fiscal responsibility, the aim is to conceal the loss to this country of &#163;10 billion. That amount, coincidentally, is nearly equal to the whole of Britain&#8217;s share in the budget increase proposed by the Commission&#8212;an increase to which we are opposed. It is simply not credible to vote for restraint and then to remove from criticism the most wasteful surrender of the British taxpayer&#8217;s interest that any Prime Minister has made in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/3">The second effect of the amendment would be to delete references to new EU taxes. Yet the tax sovereignty of this country is, or should be, non-negotiable. In particular, this removal would send a signal that this House supports the introduction of a new financial transaction tax which could badly undermine Britain&#8217;s economy. By the Commission&#8217;s own analysis, the tax would lead to a fall in European GDP of up to 3.5% and nearly half a million job losses.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/4">Thirdly and finally, there is the call simply to cut the EU budget and not, as the Government&#8217;s motion has it, to cut or, at the very least, to have a real-terms freeze. Let me address this aspect precisely, as it comes to the crux of the matter. I should like to say this not only to Labour Front Benchers but to all those Members present who are genuinely outraged by the budget proposal. Like them, I believe, very simply, that the EU should cut now, and keep on cutting. The Opposition call on the Government to persuade others and to build alliances with those who share our concerns. On the issue of budgetary restraint, that has been exactly our approach. In 2010, the Prime Minister achieved a historic breakthrough when he agreed with the leaders of Germany, France, Finland and the Netherlands that</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/5">&#8220;payment appropriations should increase at most, by no more that inflation over the next financial perspective.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/6">If this position were to be agreed to, then it would be the first time in the history of the EU that the seven-year budget has done anything other than accelerate. No one is pretending that this would represent all the long-term reform required&#8212;not a bit of it&#8212;but it would be a turning point. Having reached such an agreement, which has been scrutinised in this House in the two years since it was published, it is surely right for the Prime Minister to keep to his commitment rather than have to give backword at the last moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/7">This Prime Minister has been clear, as neither of his two predecessors were, that the remorseless rise in spending in the EU has to stop, and it will stop. If there is no cut, or no real freeze, there is no deal: the framework will be vetoed. The Prime Minister has a formidable task in persuading other countries of this&#8212;many of them were looking forward to a seven-year payout&#8212;but he has made a strong start, and he deserves the support of this House as he goes in to bat for Britain.</p>

May I first place on the record my appreciation to the Leader of the House, who is not in his place, and to the new Chief Whip, for scheduling this debate? Without the Government helpfully timetabling the motion on the report from the European Scrutiny Committee, we would not have had the opportunity to express the view of the House of Commons today.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/2">Our economy has struggled in the past two years. We have stood still while our international competitors have accelerated away, and the flatlining economy has been bad for public finances, with borrowing higher so far this year than in the same six-month period last year. It is therefore clear that all demands on the public purse need to be considered with care, and our contribution to the EU budget can be no exception.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.3/1">The two Government parties have a lot of history to confront, but I do not want to be as partisan as the Financial Secretary, except to say that in a week when 1 million letters are being sent clawing back child benefit, when police budgets are being cut by 20%, when pensioners are having their tax allowances frozen, and when some of the poorest in society are being asked to pay more in tax&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It is a fact. Given all that, would it not be perverse if the European Union were exempt from those cuts?</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/2">When times are tough, not only in Britain, but in countries throughout Europe, it is all the more important that the negotiations on the next seven-year EU spending review&#8212;the multiannual financial framework&#8212;spurn the inflationary tendencies which simply repeat previous settlements plus a nominal price adjustment.

	<p pid="c.304.6/1">I would like to make progress as we have a limited amount of time.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.6/2">The next seven years of the EU budget should prioritise jobs, growth, infrastructure and practical programmes that rejuvenate fragile economies. Building up those elements, however, means reducing EU spending elsewhere. Savings can be made on the common agricultural policy, which currently costs European nations &#163;45 billion with the UK contributing about &#163;1 billion a year. The common agricultural policy is a distorting barrier to trade liberalisation, a wasteful programme that is in need of further reform, and it is astonishing that the Government motion does not refer to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.6/3">Savings can be made on aspects of EU structural funds that represent 35% of the budget and are too often committed in a haphazard manner and depend on outdated commitments rather than future priorities. Unless structural funds contribute to positive economic development, they cannot be justified. Savings can also be made on subsidies for tobacco growers, which will be discontinued, on outdated practices such as relocating the European Parliament to Strasbourg for a week each month&#8212;that costs &#8364;200 million each year&#8212;on non-essential projects such as the House of European History museum, which cost a reported &#163;137 million, and on export refunds, which cost millions and disfigure fair trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.6/4">Savings can and must be made, and delivering a real-terms reduction in the EU budget requires a relentless focus on the justification behind detailed expenditure. That is why we need a more effective and independent EU auditor who is able to examine the impact of programmes on the EU economy. The auditor must also improve the accountability of spending on pro-growth activities, which will require the bringing together of disparate Commission priorities under the auspices of a single commissioner for growth, persistently and single-handedly concentrating on that overarching concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.6/5">How capable is our Prime Minister of delivering real reform in the EU budget? Can he come back with a deal that sees the contribution from the UK Exchequer reduced in real terms? Those are the tests he must now face. We know that his phantom veto last December placed the UK in the margins of influence, just when it mattered most, but today&#8217;s debate must be about more than the frailties of the Prime Minister. It boils down to how much we care about taxpayers&#8217; money&#8212;money that is hard-earned and needs to be safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.6/6">For every 1% that the Government concede in additional spending on the multiannual financial framework, nearly &#163;1 billion will transfer from UK taxpayers to the EU budget over the seven years of the spending review period. If negotiations fail because a member state walks away from the talks, we will simply see last year&#8217;s settlement rolled forward and supplemented by an automatic 2% inflation upgrade which, as I said, will cost our taxpayers at home an extra &#163;310 million in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.0/1">Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has not realised that trying to negotiate in a calm way on a deal that was agreed two years ago by our Prime Minister is the most sensible way to proceed. If he looks into it, he will find that new member states also have a lot of skin in the game, and they will not want us to use our veto because they will also lose out. This is not just about Britain and Britain&#8217;s veto, but about dynamics across the whole EU membership. Using our stated policy over two years in a consistent and calm fashion gives us the best chance of achieving real reductions in cost for the British taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.1/1">I have a lot of respect for the hon. Lady and she made a calm and persuasive point. The difficulty is that the Prime Minister has not been calm in these negotiations; indeed, he has deployed the veto almost three weeks before negotiations have even started. It is important to have a consistent and calm strategy, and the window of opportunity must surely be to persuade nations across the EU that their taxpayers also want a spending reduction in real terms. If the Prime Minister ends up at the November summit writing a cheque for hundreds of millions of pounds more, he will surely send an unpalatable message to millions of hard-pressed taxpayers across the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.306.7/1">I will not give way for a moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.7/2">Some people seem to think that querying the size of the EU budget is anti-European, but it is not. For those of us who believe strongly in the benefits of coming together as a community of nations and working jointly</p>
	<p pid="c.306.7/3">in the EU, it is our duty to prove that pooled budgets can be spent wisely and effectively, and retain the confidence of taxpayers everywhere. Good relationships with other EU states require a level of diplomatic acumen to persuade our partners that there is an alternative way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.7/4">The Conservative party in opposition believed in a real-terms cut. We have heard what the Minister has said and the Prime Minister was quoted at Question Time. However, we now hear that sources in No. 10 are backtracking and implying that the proposals are impossible to deliver. It is all very difficult, but what has changed? Frankly, the Prime Minister needs to have his hand strengthened in the negotiations, and it is our duty as a Parliament to fortify him at this critical stage and help him on his way.</p>
	<p pid="c.306.7/5">The amendment makes it crystal clear that a real-terms reduction should be the goal. It is a position identical to that laid out in our amendment when we last debated this question in the middle of July, and it is a position that we still support today. It is time for the House of Commons to speak with one voice on behalf of the whole nation and say to the Prime Minister, &#8220;This is what we expect of you. This is your task. Let&#8217;s do the right thing for the taxpayer and have a real-terms reduction in the EU budget.&#8221; We support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="c.307.2/1">We simply cannot afford to agree an inflationary increase to the EU. This country has 13% less income than it had just five years ago, and we are seeing 20% reductions to domestic spending. According to the House of Commons Library, if an inflationary increase is agreed, next year it will amount to &#163;290 million, every penny of which we will have to borrow. Hon. Members will have spoken to constituents on different issues, and police officers have been to my surgery. They understand that their pay is frozen, although they are less happy about changes to their pay and conditions and about not getting their increments, but they do not understand why other elements of the budget, particularly the EU, should be guaranteed inflationary increases, let alone inflationary increases all the way through to 2020.</p>

	<p pid="c.307.4/2">As well as my police officers, my local council, Medway council, of which I was a member, passed a motion asking Members of Parliament representing that area to vote for a cut in the EU budget. It wrote:</p>

	<p pid="c.308.1/1">Many hon. Members will be asking themselves the same question.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.1/2">We heard from the Financial Secretary what these EU officials are paid. The Prime Minister went to Brussels a week or two ago and said that one in six EU officials earned more than &#8364;100,000. He might have understated his case, because we need to compare like with like. Not only do they earn more than &#8364;100,000 but they pay a special, incredibly low tax rate that applies only to people who work for the EU. They get an enormous expatriate allowance that shoves on another &#8364;15,000 to &#8364;20,000. They get a huge housing allowance. And, while a group of people in this country are about to lose child benefit of about &#163;85 a month, EU officials get paid, tax free, another &#8364;300 per month per chid. They contribute virtually nothing to their pension contributions. Under the arrangement we have in this country, any time a public official earns more than the Prime Minister&#8212;&#163;142,500&#8212;that has to be signed off by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. If we had to sign off every time an EU official was, in effect, getting the same take-home pay there as the Prime Minister&#8217;s salary here, that would apply to more than 5,000 European Union officials, or more than one in six. The Chief Secretary would be doing nothing else except signing off those requests.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.1/3">Today we have an opportunity to debate and vote on the multiannual financial framework&#8212;the long-term budget. This comes round once every seven years. It requires unanimity among member states and primary legislation in this House to implement it.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, despite the agitation among Government Members, the real issue is not the objective&#8212;there is a general consensus on the need for cuts to the budget&#8212;but the weakness of the Prime Minister in being unable to negotiate and having to threaten a veto?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.308.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40502" speakername="Mark Reckless" colnum="308"  time="016:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0003.htm#12103160002523">
	<p pid="c.308.3/1">No, and that is not a sensible point at all, because we have a one-off opportunity. It is this House that ultimately votes, so if any Government Members feel uncomfortable&#8212;not because of who I will be following through the Lobby, but because of who may be following me, in support of my Conservative</p>
	<p pid="c.308.3/2">amendment&#8212;I say to them: if we send the Prime Minister to Brussels telling him that it is acceptable to agree an inflationary increase, he may come back to this House having agreed that inflationary increase. We will then have to vote on primary legislation, in Committee and on Report, for that inflationary increase for the EU budget, all the way to 2020. If Members do not want that, they should vote today for my amendment.</p>
	<p pid="c.308.3/3">The other strong argument for the amendment is this. Some people say, &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to get a real-terms cut,&#8221; but we will certainly not get one if we do not even try. If we use the veto, that is not a bad place to be; in many ways, it is better than where we would be with an agreed inflationary increase. There are two strong reasons for that. First, either we operate within a multiannual financial framework under the old, frozen ceilings carried forward, or we agree new ceilings going up by inflation, allowing higher budgets in future. Each of those budgets is always negotiated under qualified majority voting annually; the question is, where we have unanimity and where we need legislation, do we allow inflationary higher limits to 2020 or not?</p>

	<p pid="c.309.1/1">If my hon. Friend does not mind, I shall continue, as others may like to come in</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/2">The second point is that if there is no agreement on a new MFF, the process of money being transferred from the budget towards the new member states will not continue. What happened, in that disgraceful decision in 2005 when Labour gave away the rebate, is that a process was put in place whereby the new member states do not pay towards our rebate in the way that the old member states do. If the Prime Minister vetoes an MFF package, that process of money shifting to new member states will be suspended; therefore, the process by which the rebate is given away will, at least for that period, be stopped, which is a significant gain for Britain. If there is an inflationary increase, as the Government propose, we will be looking at a net contribution going from &#163;9.2 billion last year to &#163;13.6 billion at the end of the process. We simply cannot afford that.</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/3">The European Commission put out its own press release, which asked the question: &#8220;What will happen if a new MFF is not agreed?&#8221; The press release states that failure to agree a new MFF</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/4">&#8220;would considerably complicate the adoption of new programmes. And in the absence of new legal bases, including their indicative financial envelopes, no commitments could be made&#8230;those multiannual spending programmes&#8230;the 2014 budget would probably only cover the agricultural payments and the payments on outstanding commitments,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/5">and that organisations</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/6">&#8220;benefiting from EU-funds&#8230;would face severe drawbacks.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.309.1/7">If hon. Members are prepared to vote through primary legislation&#8212;later, when we get that chance&#8212;and if they are happy with an inflationary increase in the EU budget, plus everything else that will happen because of the continued loss of the rebate if that is agreed, they should vote for the Government motion. If hon. Members think that the European Union has too much money and that its budget is too large and needs to be cut, they should support my amendment.</p>

	<p pid="c.310.0/1">This debate comes at a very particular time in the economic situation in Europe. The debate on this multiannual round did not start a week or a year ago; it started three or four years ago, and it is vital that we give a clear message to the European Union, the Commission and the other member states that, however ludicrously pro-European we might be&#8212;as is the case with me&#8212;we do not believe that the European Union and the Commission should spend more money at a time when every member state is having to make cuts.</p>

	<p pid="c.310.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not. A lot of people want to take part in the debate. Perhaps he will catch Mr Speaker&#8217;s eye later.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.2/2">Mr Barroso, in his introduction to the original version of the Commission&#8217;s suggestions, said:</p>
	<p pid="c.310.2/3">&#8220;The European budget is the instrument for investment in Europe and growth in Europe.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.310.2/4">That is arrogance of the highest degree. It might be one instrument&#8212;a tiny part of the equation that is trying to refocus Europe towards a more competitive economy that is able to fight for jobs and added value against countries such as Russia, China and Mexico&#8212;but the biggest instruments must surely be the member states, or even the nations and regions within them. For instance, the factor that will make a difference to the resolution of Spain&#8217;s problems will almost certainly be the economic future of Catalunya and whether it invests in IT and future industries. It will not be the EU budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.2/5">I am also convinced that, whatever happens to the EU budget, it will not make a dramatic difference to solving the problems in Greece or in Spain. The issues in those two countries are completely different. In Spain, for instance, the sub-prime mortgage market and the way in which houses were constructed along the coast, often for the British ex-pat market, is the single biggest problem that is dragging down the Spanish economy. So I say to Mr Barroso that, although I am ardently pro-European and I believe that the European Union has been one of the great political success stories of the past 100 years, I do not believe that the EU budget is the way to resolve the problems of those countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.310.2/6">Government Members have been talking today about the small-ticket items in the EU&#8217;s expenditure. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury held rather different views from those he holds today when he was a member of the Social Democratic party. When I was a member of the Conservative party, I held exactly the same views on Europe as those I hold today. The sadness is that the Conservative party has abandoned its past.</p>

	<p pid="c.310.3/1">May I again correct the faulty recollection of the hon. Gentleman? The reason that I was a member of the David Owen branch of the SDP, rather than the one that went off in a different direction, was precisely because of its position on Europe, and I held the same views then as I do now.</p>

	<p pid="c.310.4/1">As you know, Mr Speaker, I love apologising to Government Members, and I apologise to the Minister. The point I am making is a serious one, however. He referred to some of the small-ticket items</p>
	<p pid="c.310.4/2">in the EU budget, but the big-ticket item is the common agricultural policy. If we do not address that issue in this next round, we will manifestly have failed to deal with the gaping moral and ethical hole at the centre of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="c.311.8/1">I am grateful. Does the hon. Gentleman agree, then, that in order to be able to negotiate successfully on the big-ticket items as he says, we need a sound basis on which to go forward? Supporting an amendment that would simply trash all negotiations with other EU members, such as calling for a cut that is nigh on impossible, would not be the way to progress any decent negotiation on structural reform in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.311.9/1">To be honest, I do not agree with the hon. Lady. If I take her back to the last debate I had with her on this issue, I do not think that that is the position she was advocating then. In her heart of hearts, she would prefer Parliament to give a strong single voice today, so that the Government have a negotiating position whereby they can go to Brussels, Strasbourg or wherever and say, &#8220;Look, we have the whole of Parliament behind me saying, &#8216;We&#8217;ve got to cut&#8217;.&#8221; That is why I hope she will vote for the amendment today.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.9/2">I know that some hon. Members do not like structural funds at all&#8212;perhaps this was the issue that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase>, who has already left the Chamber, wanted to raise&#8212;but I believe structural funds have a role to play in trying to make the whole European Union far more competitive in the world economy. That is certainly true for places like the valleys in south Wales. Sometimes the money is not particularly well spent, but if we did not have structural funds and cohesion funds, the danger is that each individual country would end up abusing state aid to protect specific businesses in their own country, thereby undermining countries like our own that choose not to go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="c.311.9/3">I ask Government Members this: how could we possibly go back to our constituents and say to teachers, fire officers, police officers and all the rest, &#8220;We want to give more money to the European Union, but you&#8217;ve got to live with a pay freeze, and you&#8217;ve got to live with less money, with 19% cuts year on year to local authority funding for the building of hospitals, homes and so forth.&#8221;? I just do not see how I could possibly argue that.</p>

	<p pid="c.312.1/2">I resent the Minister&#8217;s answer to my earlier question, as I think he simply misunderstood it. When the Government increased VAT in this country to 20%, it increased the amount of money we would have to pay to&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>The Minister has probably been inspired by officials at this point, so he may know the answer.</p>

	<p pid="c.312.2/1">I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman, as a former Minister for Europe, did not know the answer&#8212;that the tax base is notional, so the levies of VAT make no difference whatever. It is irrelevant.</p>

	<p pid="c.312.3/1">I will explain it all to the Minister later; he is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.312.3/2">There are some specific savings that the EU could and should make. One relates to the ludicrous caravanserai between Brussels and Strasbourg. I merely point out to Conservative Members that it was John Major who negotiated that final agreement in the treaty of Amsterdam; I wish we were able to dismantle it. It costs us &#163;180 million a year, and it is a complete and utter waste of time and money. Similarly, we have to tackle the common agricultural policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.312.3/3">My final point for Conservative Members is this. If they choose to start their negotiating position first by saying that the veto is going to be used, and secondly by saying that there is a long shopping list of things that they want the EU to deliver&#8212;the new Margaret Thatcher, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> has often referred to a shopping list&#8212;the danger is that when they get to the till, they will have to say how they are going to pay. If they have already said that they want to get out of justice and home affairs policy and all sorts of other European Union policies, they will not have a negotiating leg to stand on. If they have already declared that they are going to use the veto, they will end up with a worse, rather than a better position for the United Kingdom and will be paying more money. That is why I, as a good pro-European, will be supporting the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="c.313.0/1">The Labour party&#8212;the Opposition&#8212;will of course vote with us this evening, not the other way round. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40098" name="Dennis Skinner">the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)</phrase> correctly pointed out, exactly the same happened with the Maastricht treaty.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/2">The amendment proposed so ably by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40502" name="Mark Reckless">the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless)</phrase> is absolutely right. It deals not just with the mechanics or the technicalities, but with what is really going on under the surface. The real questions are, &#8220;Where is the money coming from?&#8221;, and &#8220;What is the object of this multiannual financial framework?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/3">I have been to many conferences in the past year in my capacity as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee&#8212;in Cyprus and Denmark, and, before that, elsewhere&#8212;and I have attended similar conferences with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40051" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr Lidington)</phrase>. They are living on another planet: that is the real problem. The main feature of that big landscape is where we are today. This is part of a picture that must be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/4">I know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is conscious of that. He knows that Mr Barroso&#8217;s speech calling for a federal Europe, which was made only a short time ago, has put us at a crossroads. We cannot continue to assume that what was being considered before that date still applies. We are now on a different journey. They are on one planet, and we are on another. We have to make a stand, and that is what this is all about.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/5">A letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-18">18 December 2011</phrase> from the Prime Minister and from the Prime Ministers of several other member states, included the following passage:</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/6">&#8220;European public spending cannot be exempt from the considerable efforts made by the Member States to bring their public spending under control.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.313.0/7">We are cutting here; we need growth. They are not cutting, but increasing. That is the point.</p>

	<p pid="c.313.1/1">I know that my hon. Friend has a great deal of empathy with the private sector. The private sector is the engine of growth in our economy and it becomes more efficient every year, but does my hon.

	<p pid="c.313.2/1">Absolutely. It is impossible to make any public expenditure&#8212;including our contributions to the whole of the public sector: health, education, local government, the lot&#8212;unless the money comes from reasonably taxed small and medium-sized enterprises. Yet the whole of the Commission&#8217;s paper&#8212;which is at the heart of the 2020 strategy and at the heart of why the Commission is asking for this increased amount of money, which it calls an investment for growth&#8212;contains only one reference to small and medium-sized businesses, in one line. That is the problem we are up against. We cannot give money to the public sector unless we get it from private enterprise on a reasonably taxed basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.313.2/2">The Prime Minister&#8217;s letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.313.2/3">&#8220;The action taken in 2011 to curb&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.313.2/4">&#8212;&#8220;curb&#8221;: that is the word he uses&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.313.2/5">&#8220;annual growth in European payment appropriations should therefore be stepped up progressively over the remaining years of this financial perspective and payment appropriations should increase, at most, by no more than inflation over the next financial perspectives.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.313.2/6">The situation was wrong then, and it has got worse since. That was in December 2011. We are now in October 2012, and we know what the picture is, and it is getting progressively worse. That is why we had to call for a reduction rather than merely what the Prime Minister describes as an</p>

	<p pid="c.314.1/1">Absolutely; that is a very good point indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.1/2">I would like to dig a little deeper into what this money is supposed to be used for. It is all set out in the papers laid before the House for the purposes of this debate. They talk about turning the EU into a &#8220;smart&#8221;&#8212;whatever that means&#8212;&#8220;sustainable and inclusive economy&#8221; delivering</p>
	<p pid="c.314.1/3">&#8220;high levels of employment productivity and social cohesion.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.314.1/4">How on earth are they going to achieve that given the measures they think will produce growth? Almost every single aspect of what they want to deliver is based on increasing grants and subsidies, but not on asking where the money is coming from.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.1/5">The money comes from our constituents. It comes from the taxpayer. It does not grow on trees. That is what they do not understand. Therefore, the entire strategy on which this multiannual financial framework is based is nonsense. It is an Alice in Wonderland fantasy, as I have repeatedly said when I have had the opportunity to meet the other 27 Chairmen of the national scrutiny committees. I have noticed that there is increasing awareness, too. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">The hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> was with me only a few weeks ago, and he noticed the degree of response I was getting from the other member states&#8217; national chairmen. They understood that they were in deep trouble.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.1/6">The money does not grow on trees in Spain; that is why there are demands for independence from Catalonia. The money does not grow on trees in France or Germany either. The fact is that it has to be found.</p>

	<p pid="c.314.2/1">The hon. Gentleman and I have significant differences about what this country&#8217;s approach to the EU should be, but does he agree that the important thing at this moment in time, with every EU member state having to make public expenditure cuts, is that the EU itself should make cuts?

	<p pid="c.314.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I do not think this is just a cynical move, even though there is an element of that. As I find when I go to meetings with those in the presidency, there is a recognition: they know they cannot go on spending money that is not there. That is the truth. That is all this argument is really about. It is about the big landscape of whether, like</p>
	<p pid="c.314.3/2">Mr Micawber, we can just hope something will turn up. It will not; it has to be built through real growth policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.3/3">Unfortunately, the report the European Commission produced only a few months ago shows it has not got a clue how to generate that growth. I was also deeply disturbed to see that the amazing report by the European Parliament calling for all these increases was welcomed by the vice-president of the European Commission, Maro&#353; &#352;efcovic. He said the MFF was &#8220;an investment budget&#8221; for delivering growth in &#8220;the entire EU.&#8221; He condemns himself outright simply by endorsing the 150 pages of unadulterated rubbish that came out of the European Parliament in its interim report.</p>

	<p pid="c.315.1/1">I absolutely agree. The real problem is that their answer is to give more money to the public sector and to ventures and projects that, as the Court of Auditors report shows, increasingly fail. The trouble is that the European project is a failing project.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/2">They will not recognise that, so what are they doing? They are saying, &#8220;We are going to go off and have a federal Europe.&#8221; Well, let them have it. They can have their federal Europe if they want, but we, in this country, cannot possibly be part of it&#8212;that is unthinkable. The Prime Minister knows it is unthinkable, and my genuine belief is that he will come to discover that it would be better to veto this and to ensure it does not go through, because he has already been presented with the crossroads. The crossroads was presented by Mr Barroso, and the crossroads is being presented by the other member states. There is no turning back. We therefore have to say no. We say no to this, we say no to the illegal banking regulations that we have just been looking at and we will be saying no to the proposals for any new treaty. If we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is and actually say that we will not accept this, we will be serving the national interest.</p>

A lot people here, on both sides of the House, will be doing what their party has asked them to do. I believe, fundamentally, that the issue of Europe has reached the point where party is not as important as the issue.

We could make a decision tonight that says, &#8220;We do not want to see an increase&#8212;we want to see a cut.&#8221; However, come the end of the process, by majority voting, we could be outvoted, no matter how many diplomatic skills we use. I am sure that many hon. Members think that they could do better if they were negotiating, but no matter how good our negotiating skills we may not get what we have asked for. My view is that we should veto at that point and then, when we are sent our bill, we should say no and tell them that we will send what we agreed.

	<p pid="c.316.2/1">Given that the Minister and the shadow Minister both said that it is the policy of the Government and Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition that they would wish to see a reduction in the European Union budget and given that there is a motion before the House asking for such a reduction, will not the public find it bizarre if that does not go through tonight?</p>

	<p pid="c.316.3/1">In my simple way, that is what I am trying to say. We are beginning to look really out of touch. It is beginning to look as though we are not interested in the people we were elected to represent. I believe that tonight is the night when we can make that difference and really change things.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.3/2">I must make an apology. I am very lucky that my constituency is literally five minutes away and I agreed some time ago that at 6 o&#8217;clock I would light the bonfire on Hallowe&#8217;en night. I shall leave to light the bonfire</p>
	<p pid="c.316.3/3">and I shall come back to vote. I hope that on that bonfire there might be something to signify something about the European Union; it would be rather nice if there were. It is not likely, however.</p>
	<p pid="c.316.3/4">Finally, I ask Members to realise that they should not worry about who is with them in the Lobby tonight. They should not worry about whether they are in the Lobby with people with whom they would rather not be in the Lobby. They should recognise that they are going into that Lobby to represent the people who elected them and should think about what they would want them to do.</p>

I apologise for giving the false impression that they were going to vote with the Government tonight.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.5/2">One problem is that this is a Westminster village affair, and I want to know what is happening on the streets in my patch. There is a lady who has been walking the streets of the Corby constituency for eight weeks or so; her name is Christine Emmett and she</p>

	<p pid="c.318.1/1">I shall press on because other Members wish to speak and I want to be as brief as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/2">I think that every Member, whether they vote for the Government&#8217;s motion or not, wants a reduced budget. We all think that there should be a real reduction in the EU budget, because how can we tell our constituents that they are suffering cuts so that we can give the European Union money to waste? We have a superb Minister at the Dispatch Box listening the debate. At its conclusion, I genuinely hope that the Government will be able to accept this modest amendment. Would not that be great? The British people, instead of seeing artificial division, would then know that the whole House was in favour of a reduced budget in real terms, albeit perhaps with the exception of Plaid Cymru Members, who might have done a dirty deal somewhere along the line.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/3">The real issue that I want to talk about is the rebate. I shall give Prime Minister Blair the benefit of the doubt, because when he gave up the rebate, he thought that there would also be a massive cut in common agricultural policy payments, meaning that our net contribution would not go up. According to figures from the House of Commons Library, during the following five years of the Labour Government, our net contribution to the EU was &#163;16 billion. That is a lot to pay for membership of the EU, but unfortunately, since Tony Blair left, our rebate has gone down and there has been no reform of the CAP, so over the period of the coalition Government, as things stand&#8212;even without a budget reduction&#8212;we will be paying &#163;36.4 billion to be a member of this club. How can we say that we will pay &#163;36.4 billion, and then that we will pay some more to allow for inflation?</p>

	<p pid="c.318.5/2">Cutting away the rest of the rhetoric, hon. Members must decide whether they will vote for a Conservative amendment calling for a real reduction in the budget, or a coalition motion that effectively calls for an increase, because it allows for inflation. I am sure that, secretly, the Prime Minister would like the whole House to vote for the Conservative amendment, because it would strengthen his hand in the negotiations enormously if he could say, &#8220;There is a united House of Commons demanding a reduction in the budget.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.319.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase>. I agree with him entirely that the Prime Minister has a wonderful opportunity, if he wishes to grasp it, to use the united stance of the Commons on EU budget cuts to increase his bargaining power in Brussels, but I fear that the Prime Minister&#8217;s negotiating position is more about damage limitation than about getting the EU budget reduced. A unique opportunity exists for EU budgetary reform and all due diligence should be directed towards advocating an overall reduction in the EU budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.2/2">The House of Commons Library has set out clearly what the reductions are for each of the Departments over the current comprehensive spending review period. There are reductions of 23% for the Home Office, 27% for the Ministry of Justice, 19% for the Ministry of Defence and 19% for the Department for Work and Pensions. Across the board there is an 11% real reduction in Government spending. In the Northern Ireland Office the reduction is 12%, in the Wales Office 12% and in the Scotland Office 11%. These are real cuts. There is nothing in these figures which allows for a freeze but an increase to cover inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.2/3">It is difficult for people in the community, as has been said by previous speakers, to understand why the Prime Minister tells people that in order to get the economy on the right footing, drastic real-terms cuts in the budgets of Government Departments are necessary, affecting front-line services. That message has been sent out by national Governments in the EU, right across the board, yet when it comes to EU expenditure, we are told that the most that we can aspire to is some kind of inflation increase. To the people in the street, to whom <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> referred, this is not only bizarre, but incomprehensible. They expect the Members whom they send to the House of Commons to stand up for the United Kingdom and for them, and to say that the same rules should apply to spending on the EU as to everybody else.</p>

	<p pid="c.319.3/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman know that the European Parliament describes the Commission&#8217;s proposal as representing a freeze of the multiannual financial framework between 2014 and 2020, and says that it would not be sufficient to finance the existing policies which come out of the treaty of Lisbon? Is there not something ironic in that, in relation to the Government&#8217;s motion?</p>

	<p pid="c.320.0/1">Absolutely. When it comes to the European Parliament, nothing surprises me. I must speak up in defence of Members of the European Parliament, including the Member from my party, who consistently vote against these federalist ideas and against increases to the budget, and stand up for the people who contact us daily, saying enough is enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/2">With reference to what the EU is doing, let us look at some of the areas of expenditure to which this year alone the UK will contribute &#163;15.8 billion and by 2014-15 &#163;19.2 billion, and that is before the increases going forward. A Member referred earlier to the European Parliament and the fact that it does not have a single seat. Ending that wanton inefficiency would equate to &#163;1.26 billion over the seven years of the 2014-20 period, but there seems to be no appetite in the EU to change that.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/3">With respect to quangos and agencies, there are 56 EU quangos, twice the number in operation in 2004. The cost to European taxpayers has increased by 33% in the past two years alone, with an estimated expenditure of &#8364;2.48 billion in 2012 alone. We were told that when it came into being, the External Action Service would not cost the British Exchequer any more money, whereas it has done precisely that. If we got rid of that unnecessary body, we would save EU taxpayers more than &#8364;480 million every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.320.0/4">I think the Minister referred to the House of European History, of all things, which, I am told, is aimed at promoting an awareness of European identity since 1946. It will cost &#163;136.5 million by 2015, with British taxpayers contributing &#163;18.6 million. Those are simply a few examples of the absolutely scandalous waste of money towards which our taxpayers are having to contribute year on year through our contributions to the EU budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.320.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that this is about fairness.

One of the problems with Parliament and politicians generally is that people do not feel that we have any connection with them or relate to their day-to-day problems. The choice before the House tonight is clear: either we vote to send a clear message that enough is enough, we expect what applies to UK Government expenditure and the national budgets of other member states to apply to the European Union, and our choice is to be on the side of the taxpayer and our people, who are out there suffering daily as a result of the cuts&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.321.2/1">This is about a debate we are having now on a budget from 2014 to 2020, not about a position we took in 2009 before any of us knew we were going to be in a coalition Government. This is a position we can decide for ourselves, knowing the circumstances we are currently in. They are entirely different situations.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.2/2">We are essentially discussing a comprehensive spending review of the European Union from 2014 to 2020, for which the European Commission has asked for a budget of &#8364;972 billion. That is roughly &#8364;100 billion above what would be a real-terms freeze. That is completely unrealistic at a time when EU member states are under real budgetary pressure, and some more so than others. It would be unacceptable for the United Kingdom to agree an increase of that magnitude, because it would represent roughly &#163;10 billion in extra contributions. Therefore, it is absolutely right that the UK Government are going into the negotiations, in concert with many other member states, asking for a real-terms freeze. That is what is important: the position our Government are taking is in agreement with that of many other member states. It is a position that has a realistic prospect of achieving the success that most of us actually want. Undermining the United Kingdom&#8217;s position today will blow a hole in that negotiating position and make it much less likely that we will get the outcome many of us wish to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="c.322.0/1">I absolutely agree, and I will come to that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/2">The negotiating position of arguing for a real-terms freeze is agreed right across the coalition Government. There is no one more Europhile than the Deputy Prime Minister, who tomorrow is going to make a speech in which he highlights several of the reasonable differences that exist between the coalition parties on our relations with the European Union and makes it absolutely clear that he fully agrees that a real-terms freeze is the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> mentioned the case for reform. The European Union spends 33.8% of its existing budget, as negotiated in 2005, on the common agricultural policy and 5.7% on a very bloated central administration system, with the caravan moving between Strasbourg and Brussels, and it could make cuts in those areas. Yet it spends only 9.2% of its budget on the competitiveness agenda&#8212;on supporting research and development and small and medium-sized enterprises. That is where we want the European Union to spend whatever its agreed budget is in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/4">The Government are right to argue against what the European Union calls its &#8220;own resources&#8221;&#8212;in other words, tax revenues directly hypothecated for the EU&#8212;and to say that we do not want that to happen with VAT. They are also right to argue against a Europe-wide financial transactions tax. My colleagues and I think that there is a good case to be made for a financial transactions tax across all the global financial centres, but many of those are outside the European Union, most obviously in Switzerland. It is not for the European Union to make the case for an FTT, and it certainly should not be the recipient of any revenues from an FTT should one be imposed in future, because it would then be taking on the personality of a state and a Government, and that is not the vision of the European Union that the Liberal Democrats wish to see. It is also right that the Government should argue for the retention of the British rebate.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/5">Labour&#8217;s position is quite extraordinary. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40098" name="Dennis Skinner">The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)</phrase>, who is no longer in his seat, gave the game away by alluding to the Maastricht votes of 20 years ago. Its position is a marriage of genuine Euroscepticism&#8212;I accept that&#8212;and naked opportunism. We in the coalition Government have waited two and a half years for Labour Front Benchers to tell us which of the cuts that the coalition Government are implementing they agree with, and, if they disagree with all of them, which has been the position thus far, at least to suggest alternatives. There has been total silence. The only cut that they are brave enough to suggest is one that has to be imposed by 26 other member states&#8212;they show no bravery at all in suggesting cuts in our own budgets. That is incredible, and for those Labour Members who are Europhiles, it is an embarrassing position in which to find themselves. I can only assume that they have been put there by their more senior Front-Bench colleagues who are not with us at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/6">Labour Members should know that it is not possible to achieve a real-terms reduction in the MFF. They did</p>
	<p pid="c.322.0/7">not manage it in 2005, when they negotiated an increase. The current leader of the Labour party, the current shadow Chancellor and the current shadow Foreign Secretary were leading members of that Government. Liberal Democrat MPs and Conservative MPs voted against an increase in November 2007. In recent years, our Members of the European Parliament, Liberal Democrat and Conservative, have consistently voted against a real-terms increase in the European budget. Labour Members of the European Parliament have voted against a freeze in the EU budget; all they voted for was extra money for the trade unions. We want the EU to spend more on measures that grow the European economy, deepen the single market and make the EU globally competitive.</p>

	<p pid="c.323.0/1">I welcome the junior Minister of State and hope he will tell us where the senior Minister of State is this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.323.0/2">This has been an excellent debate and we have heard principled contributions from Members of all parties, who hold deep, long-held convictions about Europe and the direction of travel. Anyone who is aware of my view will know that I am the co-chairman of the all-party group on European reform and that I believe that Britain is better off in Europe but that the current organisation is not satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="c.323.0/3">To give an example, <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January</phrase> saw the introduction of a European-wide ban of battery eggs, for which the UK, under the previous Government, and many other countries had campaigned successfully. However, it became clear that a number of eastern and southern European nations would fail to meet the <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January</phrase> deadline. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee took evidence on the issue last year and, when we asked the European Commission what it would do if the UK chose not to allow these illegal eggs into the country, it said that it would prosecute the United Kingdom, which is an obscene and perverse position to adopt. Saying that it would prosecute a country for upholding Europe&#8217;s own laws shows that the Commission has got its priorities wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.323.0/4">The Minister discussed cutting structural funds, but I disagree. The solution, as explored by the all-party group, is that if we repatriated the structural fund powers and spent the same amount of money as we hand to Brussels, we would have hundreds of millions of pounds more to spend in Wales, Scotland, the south-west and the south-east.</p>

	<p pid="c.324.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that this is not a debate about whether we should be in or out of Europe?

	<p pid="c.324.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct. Whether people live in Coventry, Bournemouth, Tunbridge Wells, Ribble Valley, Dunfermline or Cardiff, education budgets, child care, housing budgets and defence of the realm are being cut, yet we are expected to hand more and more money to Brussels bureaucrats to spend on vanity projects that will then attack British industry and British farmers. The British public will not understand if Members of this House, who claim that they want the best for the British taxpayer and that they want to support British industry, do not vote according to their principles and their long-held consciences and allow themselves to be corralled by their Whips into voting for this coalition motion.</p>
	<p pid="c.324.1/2">It is interesting that this is only the second time that we have seen a large Liberal Democrat turnout in the Chamber since the start of this parliamentary Session. The first time was when we debated House of Lords reform. That says it all about the quality of the motion. I urge hon. Members from all parties to listen to their taxpayers, British industry and their consciences and to vote for the amendment.</p>

I feel rather uncomfortable with what I am about to say, because I agree with pretty much everything that has been said, particularly by Government Members. Of course we all want a real cut&#8212;I am sure the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Financial Secretary do. The nub of the debate, however, is what my hon.

	<p pid="c.324.2/2">I think that the multiannual financial framework, or EU budget to use a simpler term, is insane.

Clearly he will read <i>Hansard</i>, and he will know the message that the Whips give him and so on, but do we want to bind his hands when he goes into the negotiations?

	<p pid="c.325.0/1">The real-terms freeze that the hon. Gentleman says is realistic is of course an inflationary rise.

What has suddenly changed their minds? We need not take any lectures from them. Their policies are incoherent, opportunistic and completely lacking in credibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.3/3">That brings me to the nub of the argument: which way will we go? Will we ask the Prime Minister for something that he can achieve, which is a real-terms freeze? That does not mean that he will not do better than that, because I believe he will fight our corner for real-terms cuts. I am sure he is listening to everybody who is fighting for real-terms cuts, or at least to Government Members, but what is his bottom line? What is the red line beyond which we should pull out the veto, which the hon. Member for Nottingham East has not admitted he is willing to use? That red line has to be at least a real-terms freeze. That is what today&#8217;s debate is really about.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.3/4">I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to consider what message we want to give the Prime Minister. It should be that he should negotiate in the best interests of UK plc. That means fighting for a real-terms cut&#8212;I want that, and so do all my right hon. and hon.

	<p pid="c.325.4/1">You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, were both Members of this House in 1992-93, when I was one of those pro-Europeans</p>
	<p pid="c.325.4/2">who followed my pro-European party leader, John Smith, and the spokesman for foreign affairs, Lord Robertson, into the Lobby with people whom I would never have described as having the same view as me on Europe and its future. The same thing will happen this evening, but I wish to make it clear that I do so not because I agree with the tenor and tone of the many Europhobic speeches we have heard from Government Members&#8212;and some, unfortunately, from this side of the House&#8212;but because I believe it is wrong for the European Union to increase its spending at a time when national budgets, not just in this country but in Greece, Spain, Portugal and elsewhere, are being reduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.4/3">This is not the most important debate about the future of Europe that we will face, and we must put it into perspective. Although there is talk of billions of pounds and euros, the EU budget is only 1% of the GDP of all member states. In this country, public spending accounts for more than 40% of our GDP each year, and we must put into perspective the fact that the EU&#8217;s total spend is very small.</p>
	<p pid="c.325.4/4">In his introductory remarks, the Minister referred to the size of the Commission. I was unable to intervene at that point, but let me place on the record that the European Commission has, in total, between 30,000 and 33,000 employees who serve 27 member states. The Minister&#8217;s Department in Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs alone has about 80,000 employees, and we must get such things into perspective. We do not have a gargantuan European Union bureaucracy hoovering up resources; in fact, the UK Government spend five times as much servicing the interest on the national debt each year than they do in European Union contributions.</p>

	<p pid="c.326.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is talking about the administration of the European Commission, which at 30,000 employees I think is still too large.

	<p pid="c.326.1/1">I agree with that, but I also point out that the UK contribution to the European Union is less than that of Germany. Our net contribution&#8212;with the rebate that was retained by the previous Labour Government&#8212;is comparable to that made by France, a similar country in terms of size, population and GDP. We are among the net contributors, but the European Union is also about solidarity. One thing that led to the growth of the European Union, and the increased trade and prosperity from which British workers and British companies benefit, is the fact that countries such as Spain and Portugal&#8212;and, increasingly, countries such as Slovenia&#8212;are growing and benefiting by their membership of the EU.</p>

	<p pid="c.327.1/1">I would hope that my right hon. Friend and I&#8212;we are of a similar age&#8212;will live long enough to see that, but I do not think it will happen immediately. It will require the eurozone to become much more tightly organised than it is today.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.1/2">Last week, I visited Germany and Norway with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. We are considering the future of Europe and the implications for this country of different options that might arise. Two or three years ago, the political debate in Germany was about trying to keep Britain on board and to move with Britain. However, the reality, right across the political spectrum, is that Germany has given up on the UK under the coalition Government. The Germans see their future as being with France and Poland, and their priority will be to save the eurozone at all costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.1/3">That means that the UK will be in an uncomfortable position. The Prime Minister might have signed a joint letter with European leaders in 2010, but the reality in 2012-13 is that Germany is not with us. Anybody who thinks that only Germany is not with us should read the remarks of Radek Sikorski, the Polish Foreign Minister, who gave a radical speech in Oxford just a few weeks ago, in which he used phrases such as:</p>
	<p pid="c.327.1/4">&#8220;Poland wants to be with Germany and France as partners&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.1/5">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="c.327.1/6">&#8220;You could, if only you wished, lead Europe&#8217;s defence policy&#8230;Britain&#8217;s leaders need to decide once again how best to use their influence in Europe&#8230;The EU is an English-speaking power. The Single Market was a British idea. A British commissioner runs our diplomatic service&#8230;But if you refuse, please don&#8217;t expect us to help you wreck or paralyze the EU.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.327.4/1">All Government Members will recognise how deeply shabby Opposition Front Benchers&#8217; behaviour has been. I was a Member of the House when Blair negotiated away a large part of the rebate on the understanding that the common agricultural policy would be reformed. A large part of the rebate disappeared, but the CAP was not reformed, and Labour Members now have the audacity to complain that the CAP needs reform. It is a deeply shabby performance this afternoon by the Labour party and the official Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.4/2">I want address my comments in the short time I have to my hon. Friends. On the specific motion, hon. Members will agree that, if the Prime Minister manages to negotiate a real-terms freeze in the EU budget, it will be the</p>
	<p pid="c.327.4/3">toughest financial negotiated settlement the EU has seen. If he achieves that, he will have achieved something that no one has achieved before. That is a matter of fact.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.4/4">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40329" name="Mike Gapes">the hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes)</phrase>, who used to chair the Foreign Affairs Committee, said, we are talking about part of an overall picture of negotiations that the Prime Minister will have to undertake over the next few years when renegotiating our position on Europe. As many countries become closer in the eurozone, where will that put us? We must renegotiate.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.4/5">Colleagues on the Government side of the House have a choice: we either support the Prime Minister or we do not. If colleagues are not prepared to support him, every time they go into a different Lobby from him, they weaken his negotiating hand in Europe. Please let us not accept the blandishments from some that the Prime Minister has a negotiating strategy that he is not willing to show us. I can assure the House that the Prime Minister is perfectly capable at the Dispatch Box of telling the House what he wants to do, what he wants to achieve and where he wants to be supported.</p>
	<p pid="c.327.4/6">I was a Minister throughout every day of John Major&#8217;s Government, and I know just how much that Government were weakened by colleagues persistently going into the Division Lobby voting against the 1992-97 Conservative Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.328.0/1">My hon. Friend and the Front-Bench team have articulated the challenge of achieving even a settlement that allows for no increase other than one in line with inflation, and part of that challenge involves building a coalition. It would be completely counter-productive, having got the agreement of Germany, France and the Netherlands, to go back to those countries and say, &#8220;Actually, our Parliament&#8217;s changed its mind.

	<p pid="c.328.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It is time we started to be grown up. I am sorry if I sound like an old stager but, having lived through the Major years, I must say to my Conservative colleagues that we simply cannot carry on with the sort of self-indulgence that we see on the Order Paper today. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221;] No, no. We cannot continue with this self-indulgence.</p>
	<p pid="c.328.1/2">The reason Blair was able to give away the rebate was largely because we lost the general election in 1997, and one reason we lost the general election was because the nation was not prepared to vote for a party and a Government that they saw as being deeply divided. <i>[Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> might think that amusing, but I do not think that the country thought it amusing that the Labour party was in a position to give away a large part of this nation&#8217;s rebate.</p>
	<p pid="c.328.1/3">The Conservative party has a responsibility to do the best it can for the country, and I have every confidence that the Prime Minister is seeking to do that. He has to renegotiate the whole of the UK&#8217;s position within the EU. That will take considerable tact and diplomacy, and he is entitled to consider that he has the support of Conservative Members when he does so.</p>

	<p pid="c.329.6/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>, although I took exception to some of his comments about the Opposition&#8217;s view.</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/2">I have served in Parliament for 12 years, and I supported increases to the EU budget, but this time, with the depth of the recession and a double-dip that was predicted before the general election, clearly the economic conditions are very different. Although the case is being made for a cut on the grounds that the economy is doing badly, I wonder how many Government Members would make the case for an increase when there is growth in the economy and Europe is doing well, as it has in the past.</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/3">In times of austerity, it is clear that there is no popular mandate for an above-inflation increase in the multiannual financial framework. The Opposition have outlined the need for a real-terms cut in the budget for 2014 to 2020. I will not revisit the arguments&#8212;they have already been articulated by my colleagues&#8212;but on the question of the veto, the Prime Minister has no friends in Europe. I was on the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs visit to Berlin; I have spoken to the Germans and others from elsewhere in Europe in recent months. The Prime Minister was bragging today that he has a veto and is not afraid to use it. That is like the madman with a gun&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a gun and I&#8217;m not afraid to use it&#8221;&#8212;but the trouble is that the gun is pointing at the Prime Minister&#8217;s feet, and he will isolate himself even more as he goes into those important negotiations in November.</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/4">I would like to address the need to look at budget reform, particularly the pressing need to retain and strengthen the aid budget delivered through the general EU budget, which is about 70% of the EU&#8217;s total spending on aid. The EU institutions are the world&#8217;s second largest aid donor behind the US, disbursing</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/5">$12.6 billion of development assistance in 2011. Combined with the aid provided by each member state, the EU is responsible for some 60% of the world&#8217;s official development assistance. That is something to be commended. I am sure I do not need to remind the Financial Secretary, but the coalition agreement states:</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/6">&#8220;The Government believes that even in these difficult economic times, the UK has a moral responsibility to help the poorest people in the world. We will honour our aid commitments, but at the same time will ensure much greater transparency and scrutiny of aid spending to deliver value for money for British taxpayers and to maximise the impact of our aid budget.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/7">The European Commission&#8217;s &#8220;Proposals on external action instruments&#8221;, published in June last year, provided the basis for negotiations on development assistance in the multiannual financial framework. The European Commission proposes a 19% real-terms increase in the EU budget-financed development co-operation instrument. I am all for us cutting the contribution for this country; at the same time, I do not think that we as a developed nation should neglect the poorest people in the world. I hope that the Financial Secretary and the Prime Minister, when he goes into those negotiations, will support the Commission in securing a well above-inflation increase in the development co-operation instrument. That would mean an increase from &#8364;17.2 billion in 2007 to 2013 to &#8364;20.6 billion. I would also like to see budgetisation of the European development fund, which for a number of reasons is outside the European Union budget, in addition to major reform of the common agricultural policy. The CAP amounts to about &#163;45 billion, with the UK contributing around &#163;1 billion. In relation to aid policy, the CAP undermines international trade liberalisation and distorts trade, running counter to the objectives of the aid budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.329.6/8">It is easy to lose sight of the human tragedy of poverty&#8212;the inability to pay for medicines to help a sick child; not knowing where one&#8217;s next meal will come from; war-torn countries without the basic infrastructure to support communities. Britain has moral authority in this area, but we can retain it only if we remain committed to a real-terms increase in the EU aid budget and a real-terms decrease in Britain&#8217;s contribution to the EU budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.330.0/1">The speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40488" name="Mark Hendrick">the hon. Member for Preston (Mark Hendrick)</phrase> sounded more like a speech in favour of an increase in the European budget, albeit disguised as a speech in favour of a cut, because that happens to be what he is being asked to vote for today.</p>
	<p pid="c.330.0/2">I note that passions are high in this debate, not least among my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40329" name="Mike Gapes">the hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes)</phrase>. Let me assure them both&#8212;because I think they come from the same European stable&#8212;that the last thing those of us who support the amendment want to do is wreck Europe or to wreck our relationship with our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.330.0/3">But something very big is happening in British politics&#8212;much bigger than this debate. We are debating the European multi-annual financial framework, but there is something rather familiar about the positions being adopted by those on the two Front Benches. One could almost imagine that, if they were to change places, each</p>
	<p pid="c.330.0/4">would be making the other&#8217;s speech. Indeed, in the last Parliament, one felt that that was exactly what was happening. There is something deeply disconnected about the debates that we have been having in the House about our future relationship with the European Union, and about the aspirations of the British people and what they want that relationship to be.</p>
	<p pid="c.330.0/5">I would caution my right hon. and hon. Friends against taunting Labour Members over their volte face on this issue. I have no doubt that they have made a volte face on the question of European spending, but for us to accuse them of doing so will cut absolutely no ice with the voters. I would note, however, that the Labour party&#8217;s volte face represents a big shift in the politics of this country and in the politics of our relationship with the European Union. Labour is an opposition party that is hungry for power. Even Labour Members can now sense the tide of opinion that is flowing against the European Union among our voters. They are picking up the vibrations from their constituents and from the voters they need in order to get elected, and they have discovered a new principle in order to reflect that: they now want to cut the European budget.</p>

Those institutions are so overpowering and so powerful that even the veto of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom cannot stop the European train on its way to its destination. The British people feel that something has gone wrong with that relationship. This was not the basis on which we were sold membership of the institution, and it was not the basis on which all the assurances were given by successive Governments that each treaty represented no substantial change and was just a &#8220;tidying-up exercise&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.331.5/1">I would just point out that we should not try to make ourselves too important in this debate. This is a take-note motion. I have spoken in many debates on such motions. The amendment expresses an opinion on whether the Prime Minister should adopt this little bit</p>
	<p pid="c.331.5/2">of body language or that little bit of body language. It will not make a blind bit of difference to what he does when he goes to the Council of Ministers. The amendment is simply a cry of despair from the British people who want their elected representatives to say something to the Front Benchers of both parties, who have betrayed the British people on the question of our relationship with our European partners throughout the 20 years I have been in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.331.5/3">The problem in this country is that the governing class is now so out of line with our people&#8217;s aspirations for the relationship with our European partners that they are putting the United Kingdom in the worst of all possible worlds. It cannot deliver the engagement of the British state with our European partners on the terms set down in the treaties, and it is not trying to deliver the different terms of agreement with our European partners that the British people would prefer, that our country needs, and that are in the national interest. So wide is this gulf that even the Labour party is picking up the vibrations and is beginning to respond.</p>

	<p pid="c.332.3/1">I do not want to leave the European Union; I want us to engage in a renegotiation of our terms of membership. Now is perhaps not the occasion for such a debate, but it is quite clear that the European Union is becoming a very different kind of European Union&#8212;even from the European Union agreed in the Lisbon treaty, let alone from the Common Market, which the British people voted to join all those years ago. It seems to me that if the EU is changing fundamentally and we do not want to be part of a political union, an economic union or part of a currency union or a banking union, we are going to have to change the arrangements by which the EU can legislate to make the laws in our own land.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.3/2">That seems to me to be absolutely plain and axiomatic, absolutely simple, yet what we have at the moment is a coalition that is paralysed by that coalition&#8212;paralysed by an institutionalised disagreement by the two parties in coalition. The renegotiation opportunities at the moment are passing us by. The British people are aware of that paralysis and I do not think that they will put up with it. We are going to finish up having more debates like this, more crises, more difficulties, more dysfunctionality in how Ministers are forced to conduct themselves in the councils of Europe&#8212;and that will put this country in the worst of all possible worlds. To that extent, I agree with the hon. Member for Ilford South.</p>
	<p pid="c.332.3/3">What this country needs to do is rapidly reassess what relationship we want with the European Union so that our resources can no longer be appropriated in a manner over which even this House, which founded its powers on the control of supply, has no control. As for &#8220;own resources&#8221;, it is about the European Union having the right to sequester taxation, money and supply from</p>
	<p pid="c.332.3/4">our country, without the consent of this House. I do not think that is what the British people want; it is certainly not good value for money, and they can see that. This relationship is in crisis. The message that a vote for this amendment tonight will convey to the Government is that they are not addressing this crisis with sufficient urgency.</p>

	<p pid="c.333.0/1">It is a great joy to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase>. In this debate, I believe the people of Northern Ireland would expect me to lay down the marker that if we as citizens of the United Kingdom have to share in the necessary austerity measures required to get us out of our current financial problems, we should expect the same rigours to be placed on the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.333.0/2">I have the honour of serving as Finance Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive. Over the last couple of years, I have had to defend and explain and implement a 40% cut in the capital budget of the Northern Ireland Executive. I have had to resist Ministers who stood out in the streets protesting against cuts to the education budget, the health budget and other budgets, and explain that we were at an end of making money available for all the things we had to do. I think the people would find it difficult if, when it came to the over-fed bureaucracy of Europe, we did not take the same stance. As for the arrogance of the bureaucrats in the European Union&#8212;sometimes described as the Bisto bureaucrats who think that the gravy train is still running&#8212;we need to put down a marker and say that the years of simply asking for money and getting it are at an end.</p>
	<p pid="c.333.0/3">Many Members have said today that this is only a cynical exercise, that it will hurt the Prime Minister, that Labour Members are jumping on the bandwagon and that they are a bunch of hypocrites. I must say that I share some of the cynicism about what happened in the past, but this is not about what happened in the past; it is about what we are going to do now. I am sure that if the former leader of my party were here, he would tell the House that there is great joy in heaven over one sinner that cometh to repentance, and that there should be unbounded delight on the other side when a whole party-load of sinners may have come to repentance and renounced their fiscal sins of the past.</p>
	<p pid="c.333.0/4">Regardless of the motives behind it, the amendment does not weaken but strengthens the Prime Minister&#8217;s position. It enables him to go to Europe and say, &#8220;The entire House of Commons supports my position, and I have to go back to the House and explain. Either you make changes in the budget, or I cannot carry it in the House of Commons, because I am facing united support for the stance I am taking.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.333.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making his case in typically passionate terms and I am reluctant to interrupt him, but, as a realist, is he aware that the 8% increase in the last multiannual budget was the smallest increase ever agreed in the EU? The chance that Brussels will now accept a real-terms freeze, let alone a cut, is virtually zero, and therefore we are almost inevitably heading for a veto. Is</p>
	<p pid="c.333.1/2">not the only real question whether the Leader of the Opposition joins the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in supporting that veto?</p>

	<p pid="c.334.0/1">I have no difficulty with the veto. I do not have to be ambivalent about the veto. Whatever is required in these vital negotiations&#8212;whatever leverage is required&#8212;must be used. The point I am making is that the best leverage that the Prime Minister can exert in the negotiations is his ability to say, &#8220;Regardless of their positions on the party-political spectrum in the House of Commons, all its Members support me in saying that we will not give an extra penny to the European Union, and, furthermore, we want to see a reduction in the amount of money that we give to the European Union.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.334.1/1">I agree that we should constrain the amount of money we send to Europe, but in financial terms the difference between the amendment and the original motion could be less than &#163;1 a year. Why divide the House when we all wish to constrain that amount?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.334.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40223" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="334"  time="018:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0003.htm#12103160002629">
	<p pid="c.334.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is wrong. As so much of our rebate is not covered in the new arrangements owing to increases for new member states, our contributions would go up by 5.3% over the seven years even if we opted for and secured a real-terms freeze in the budget. We are talking not about pennies, but about billions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.2/2">The bottom line that is suggested in the motion would actually prove very costly for the British taxpayer, which is why a motion proposing not a real-terms freeze but a real reduction in our contributions to the EU could, and in my view should, gain unanimous support in the House. That is the only way of ensuring that the austerity that people in the United Kingdom have had to experience is also experienced in the European Union. It is not that there are no ways in which money can be saved. For 17 years, the European Union&#8217;s accounts could not even be signed off because billions could not be accounted for. The amount of waste that takes place in the EU shows that it is not impossible to make reductions.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.2/3">I do not know whether I shall be on the right or the wrong side of the vote tonight, in terms of who wins, but I do know that the Lobby that I go through will be the Lobby entered by Members who are standing up for people who have experienced austerity, and experienced it stoically because they believe that it is the right way to ensure the financial soundness of the United Kingdom. I will go through that Lobby because I am on the side of those who want to give the Prime Minister the best hand in the negotiations. I will go through that Lobby for the sake of the people who want to see an end to European and bureaucratic waste. For those reasons, I shall support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="c.334.3/1">I support the amendment. Teachers, police officers and nurses in my constituency have told me, &#8220;Not a penny more.&#8221; Today we paid tribute to our armed forces&#8212;those fallen heroes and heroines&#8212;but this Government have set in place a pay freeze for our armed forces. In April next year, armed forces salaries will be capped at 1% for the next</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/2">two years. Is it right, and can we justify to our constituents, that our brave armed forces, spilling their blood in Afghanistan as we speak this evening, are not going to receive the same treatment as the European Union&#8212;a wasteful, profligate and inefficient European Union?</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/3">Is it so difficult to conceive that a multiannual budget over the next six or seven years of almost &#8364;1 trillion might be able to find some efficiency savings? Our local councils are having to find them, member states are having to find them and, most importantly, our constituents are having to find them. There are increasing numbers of food banks, and people are struggling to pay their utility bills and to put shoes on their children&#8217;s feet for the new school year. It is our job to represent our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/4">I say to Front Benchers that we do not risk doing ourselves a disservice. We are not being self-indulgent, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> said. I think it is the ultimate act of self-indulgence to continue to ignore the will of the British people. The British people want us, as their representatives, to stand up to an over-bureaucratic Brussels&#8212;an obese Brussels that needs to go on a diet like everyone else, including all our constituents, this Government and member states throughout the European Union. The Prime Minister&#8217;s hand can be strengthened by a united Parliament. A disunited Parliament will weaken his negotiating hand.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/5">The Government speak about a real-terms freeze. Let us be truthful: a freeze is not a cut. What is this real-terms freeze? It is not really a freeze as there will be increased cash&#8212;an extra &#163;300 million a year, year on year, will be required by the European Union even if the Prime Minister is successful with the so-called real-terms freeze. That sum is the equivalent of two medium-sized district general hospitals in each of our constituencies and of a medium-sized borough council&#8212;the same councils we all represent, who are looking for 20% cuts or more. Let us stop dancing on the head of a pin, as the Conservative party so often does. Let us stop playing semantics and being disingenuous with the British people. We are talking about &#163;300 million next year, and hundreds of millions, and billions, of pounds beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/6">This is the decision we have to make today: are we going to continue to ask families throughout this country to stop putting new shoes on their children&#8217;s feet in order to pay for the very large Mercedes fleet in Brussels? That is the choice. This is a moment of truth, and it is no good Eurosceptics on the Government Benches speaking about things in Eurosceptic terms&#8212;it is no good our going around parading as Eurosceptics&#8212;if our actions defy what we say we believe. At the European elections in 2014, it will be no good our wrapping ourselves in the Union flag if tonight we take it off and wrap ourselves in the stars of the European Union flag.</p>
	<p pid="c.334.3/7">This is a moment of truth. This is a moment of decision. We can send a united message, as a Parliament and as a nation, to Brussels. Let us make a difference. If we are not making a difference, we might as well all go home.</p>

	<p pid="c.336.0/1">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. Without indulging in some of stronger language and rhetoric of different colleagues, I say that this may be an important parliamentary moment, because the British people decided in May 2010 not to give any of us a majority. I think they wanted a different kind of Parliament to emerge, one that was a bit freer, a bit more liberal and a bit less whipped; I am a party animal myself and the Whips are necessary, but perhaps tonight some signal can be sent that we are listening.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.0/2">There are technical points that can and cannot be made. I would dearly love to see, in South Yorkshire or perhaps in Northern Ireland, every public servant&#8217;s salary reduced to &#8364;100,000&#8212;about &#163;80,000. If that salary level was applied, there would be a revolt in Whitehall, and among Cabinet Ministers and senior Ministers of State, if not perhaps among junior Ministers of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.0/3">We have heard the language of &#8220;betrayal&#8221; used, and I think that is silly, because the country is going through a serious discussion about what its future relationship with Europe will be. The people have never elected Mr Nigel Farage or the UK Independence party to a seat in this House, although they have elected him to the European Parliament. However, his spirit has been present in much of tonight&#8217;s debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.0/4">We are facing a fundamental divide, as there are two approaches to European politics. We heard one earlier today, when the ten-minute rule Bill was introduced. It was supported by a large number of Conservative Members and it called for the end to the free movement of people in Europe. It was a well-argued case, but of course it utterly destroys the purpose of the European Union if we are to have passport checks at every border and not allow people to live where they wish.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.0/5">We are now finding that there is a big debate about the money we spend. I take all the points that have been made about cuts, but we could have the same argument about the Department for International Development&#8217;s spending, and I might argue about whether the &#163;13 billion we spent in Afghanistan is money wisely spent. Underneath it all is this dichotomy over Europe. There is a debate about being in or out&#8212;an honest debate that we are beginning to have&#8212;and another debate among those of us who believe we should stay in the European Union about what kind of European Union there should be.</p>
	<p pid="c.336.0/6">The voting of money is, of course, what determines what kind of policy we have. This budget is the wrong budget, drawn up by conservatives and cautious, complacent centre-right bureaucrats and politicians. It is inappropriate and it keeps the European budget in the same old tramlines of protectionist common agricultural spending and ineffective regional spending.</p>

	<p pid="c.337.0/1">The figures we are talking about are truly enormous. In the three options&#8212;the EU proposal, a real-terms freeze and a cash freeze&#8212;we are talking about commitments of &#163;990 billion, &#163;885 billion and &#163;771 billion. So these are very important matters, affecting every man and woman in this country. I have to say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>, with whom I have spent 29 years in this House, that his speech was quite inflammatory. His main line of attack appears to be that those of us who are going to support the amendment are somehow putting our Government at risk by joining with the Labour party. I have heard the argument before; it was actually the argument put by Neville Chamberlain in the Norway debate, when he said that he could rely on his friends. Over the years we have been here, many Members of Parliament have taken the view that principle is sometimes more important than partisanship. We have consistently argued about these matters through difficult times and it is quite wrong to blame us, who have taken an entirely consistent position, for putting the Government&#8217;s political position at risk.</p>

They are serving shifts at all hours of the day and night, and they are coming to our surgeries because we are having to make real cuts to our police force. As has been said, we are having to make real cuts to our armed forces. Our own people are coming to us and saying that this is surely the time to make a stand. Given what is happening to the budgets in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and given that great legions of young people in those countries are unemployed, is it so unreasonable just to ask the leaders of Europe to insist in the Council of Ministers on a real cash freeze? Is that unreasonable? I do not think so&#8212;I think it is entirely reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="c.337.4/3">Our friends in Europe take the House of Commons very seriously. As is known, I am happy to be a Francophile and I watch what happens in the Assembl&#233;e Nationale. This debate could not be replicated there. It is being watched, however. This is the House of Commons. We were created to guard the nation&#8217;s finances and look after the interests of our own taxpayers. Why cannot the House of Commons, on this great occasion, make a stand on behalf of the UK taxpayers? Why can we not say to our taxpayers that we stand with them? We are having to make appallingly difficult decisions about the police, the armed forces, education and health. All we are saying is that there should be a real freeze in the EU. This is not just about EU civil servants, 40% of whom earn more than &#163;70,000 a year.</p>

	<p pid="c.338.1/1">There is no time, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="c.338.1/2">This is about real people in real places. For instance, I represent a farming constituency. The UK spends &#163;7.1 billion a year on subsidising foreign farmers, giving some &#163;33 billion and receiving &#163;26 billion. On average, the UK receives &#163;188 per hectare, compared with France, Germany and Holland, which receive &#163;236, &#163;251 and &#163;346 respectively. Some 42% of the EU budget is spent on subsidising farming and fishing, despite their accounting for only 2% of European gross annual value. These are real issues that affect real people. The House of Commons now has a chance to take a stand and we should put principle before partisan politics.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.338.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" speakername="Paul Blomfield" colnum="338"  time="018:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0004.htm#12103178000750">
	<p pid="c.338.2/1">We should remind ourselves that just as there is a majority in the House, of which I am a part, in favour of a reduction in the EU budget, there is a much larger majority, of which I am also a part, that believes that our future lies at the heart of Europe and with our membership of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.338.2/2">We should therefore take care&#8212;more care than some Members have&#8212;with how we frame any debate on the EU budget. We should not frame it, as the <i>Daily Express </i>does, as if all EU spending is bad and that the only purpose of Brussels is to take money from us. I come from a region that has benefited enormously from European structural funds, and we should have spent more time in the debate considering how we can engage</p>
	<p pid="c.338.2/3">positively to shape negotiations on the priorities for the EU budget. I shall make several specific points about research and innovation, to which I hope that the Minister will respond.</p>
	<p pid="c.338.2/4">EU research and innovation funding contributes 10% of our national science budget, and the budget negotiations give us an important opportunity to shape investment priorities for the benefit of the UK economy. The more the EU invests in research and innovation, the more the UK benefits, because the quality, breadth and depth of UK research puts us in a position whereby we gain disproportionately from European research programmes. Nearly 15% of the EU&#8217;s funding from the FP7 framework programme for research has gone to UK researchers, and the total FP7 contribution to UK research is expected to reach &#8364;7 billion over the life of the programme. The UK is involved in more successful FP7 projects than either France or Germany, accounting for 40% of all grants to date. We also benefit extensively from the collaboration and research networks that the EU facilitates. Of the 5,105 research projects that have been funded under FP7, 43% include UK partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.338.2/5">Only about 8% of the proposed budget is allocated to Horizon 2020, which is the replacement for the FP7 programme. That has been presented as an increase, because there are several new projects within Horizon 2020. I think that the Government would support those projects, but on the basis of past negotiations, there is concern among businesses and universities that the research budget is especially vulnerable to cuts. We know that innovation plays an important role in producing growth in the UK, and 54% of the jobs grown between 2000 and 2005 were in innovative companies. However, such companies account for only 6% of UK businesses, and are particularly involved in pharmaceuticals and biotechnical research.</p>
	<p pid="c.338.2/6">We know that future growth will rely on knowledge-based industries, so I look to the Government to make two commitments: first, that the additional projects in Horizon 2020, which I am sure they would support, will be considered outside the framework; and, secondly, that they will argue the case for protecting the research and innovation budget in the overall negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="c.339.1/1">I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="c.339.1/2">At the beginning of the debate, there was an outbreak of consensus between those on the two Front Benches, when the Minister and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> agreed that the Government and the Opposition shared the objective of achieving a real reduction in the EU budget. Such a reduction would not be possible if the EU had gone through the process that all our councils are going through by squeezing out all the fat and getting rid of all unnecessary expenditure, but both Front-Bench spokesmen could cite examples&#8212;not least the two Parliaments&#8212;of where the EU could still make plenty of savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.339.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> mentioned the experiences of Maastricht, but this is not Maastricht. The Conservative party is united</p>
	<p pid="c.339.1/4">on Europe. We are united in believing that it is doing too much and spending too much. We had the slogan, &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together.&#8221; How will we be able to go back to our constituencies and look in the eye our electors who are paying hugely more for petrol, food and rail fares?</p>
	<p pid="c.339.1/5">This House matters again. As a united House of Commons, we have the opportunity to back the Prime Minister by sending him emboldened to the European Council with the clear message from the British people that enough is enough. If we are taking cuts, the European Union must take them, too.</p>

	<p pid="c.340.0/1">This has been a debate of passionate contributions, as befits such an important consideration&#8212;the next seven years&#8217; budget of the EU. It is right, and many Members have referred to this, that the House should give consideration not just to the aspirations and the good intentions surrounding the European Union, but to the nitty-gritty&#8212;the decisions that need to be taken and which affect all our constituents. I am proud to be a Member of a House that will undertake this level of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/2">It comes down to this: we want to see a real-terms cut in the budget. We all want to negotiate for that. That is the position that unites most Members of the House, but in seeking to advance that agenda the Prime Minister has done something historic, something that no Prime Minister during the history of our engagement with the European Union has managed to do, which is to secure from the most powerful allies that we have in the European Union a position that we should negotiate for the first time a cut over seven years in the EU budget, or a maximum of a real-terms freeze. That was agreed two years ago and has been scrutinised by the House in detail. Having put that to the House, it is reasonable for the Prime Minister to go into the negotiating chamber able to deliver on the commitments that he has had from his colleagues there.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.0/3">It has been made clear that we on the Government Benches regard this as a red line. We will deploy a veto if our conditions are not met. That is widely understood. This debate will be watched outside the Chamber and everyone can be clear about that. We have seen total confusion on the part of the Opposition as to what is a red line. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Foreign Secretary and the shadow Chancellor would not confirm that they would even deploy a veto. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The shadow Justice Secretary asks what our position is. Our position is that we would deploy a veto if our conditions and our red lines are not met.</p>

	<p pid="c.340.1/1">Can the Minister confirm the amount of extra money which, under the Government&#8217;s proposals, we will send to the EU over the next two and a half years? According to my calculations and the House of Commons Library, it is an extra &#163;1.3 billion between now and the next general election. Can he confirm that figure or tell the House what the figure is?</p>

	<p pid="c.340.2/1">It is true that the increase that we are talking about would involve further contributions from the House, but the negotiation that we are entering is to avoid that, to minimise the contribution that we make and to secure the best deal for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40098" name="Dennis Skinner">The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)</phrase>, who is not in his seat, referred to the Maastricht debates and the attitude of the official Opposition at the time. If we could have drawn from the behaviour of the Opposition their intention in government, we would have reached a wholly misleading conclusion. During their time in government, from 1998 to 2010, they presided over a 47% increase in the contributions that we made to the EU budget. They surrendered our rebate in return for no reform. The reform that we were expecting was in the common agricultural policy. Our contribution to that increased over the time that they were in power from &#163;48 billion to &#163;56 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.340.2/3">We have secured the agreement of member states. We have led the way by managing our national finances. If our negotiating position does not succeed, we are ready, willing and able to veto. We urge the House to stand with us as the Prime Minister goes to negotiate for us.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue; I know that a number of right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House are interested in this subject.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.2/2">In the early hours of the new year, I was greeted in my constituency by the shocking news that four people had lost their lives in a shooting in the close-knit former mining community of Horden. They were Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, as well as the gunman, Michael Atherton, 42, who turned the gun on himself.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.2/3">Following the shooting, I called for a calm and measured response, but the high emotions at the time were not conducive to constructive debate. In the months that followed, I had the opportunity to meet family members on a number of occasions. They have acted in a considered and dignified manner throughout, and looked for practical improvements that will hopefully avoid such tragic circumstances, and such a tragedy, befalling another family.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.2/4">A public debate on firearms licensing is still needed, and the time is right for the public and Parliament to consider whether the current level of protection is adequate. It is said that Britain has some of the toughest gun control laws in the world, but we should not be complacent. Current firearms laws consist of 34 separate pieces of legislation, which is complex and difficult to navigate for the police and the public. The Home Office&#8217;s official police guidance is more than 200 pages long. The rules are difficult to interpret, and their application can vary greatly across the 43 police forces responsible for issuing firearms licence certificates.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.5/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. He will know that it is two years since the Home Affairs Committee published its report on firearms control and suggested that the 34 pieces of legislation be codified.

	<p pid="c.347.6/1">I am grateful for that intervention; it was delivered with some authority and I completely agree.

	<p pid="c.348.0/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point and I will come to some suggestions about how we might address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/2">The Association of Chief Police Officers firearms and explosives licensing working group has called for a single form of certificate that</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/3">&#8220;remains desirable for safety and economic reasons&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/4">In terms of public safety, and in contrast to a section 1 firearm, shotgun applicants are not required to demonstrate a good reason for wanting a shotgun. I believe it important that people demonstrate that they have a need or use for a firearm, before they are granted a licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/5">In evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, Mrs Gill Marshall-Andrews of the Gun Control Network said:</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/6">&#8220;The starting point should be that guns are lethal weapons and the onus should be on the applicant, somebody who wants to own a gun, to prove that they are&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.348.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. The House should be concerned about firearms licences and licensees. Just after the summer, it was reported that no fewer than 3,000 legitimately owned and licensed firearms were reported lost, missing or stolen in the previous 12 months.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-31c.348.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" speakername="Grahame Morris" colnum="348"  time="019:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121031/debtext/121031-0004.htm#12103178001372">
	<p pid="c.348.2/1">That alarming statistic is one of a number that should exercise the minds of hon. Members, and it adds weight to the need for a full public debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.2/2">It should no longer be acceptable to have a shotgun without a good reason. A good reason would have to be demonstrated by the same criteria that current firearms certificate holders must meet. Good reasons for holding shotgun licences include dealing with vermin or game, target shooting at an approved venue or club, or for professional use in employment, but evidence is needed to justify those reasons. It is difficult for many, including me, to comprehend why someone would need access to firearms in a domestic setting when there is little need for immediate access to a weapon.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.2/3">One of the greatest weaknesses identified by the shooting fraternity is the variation in standards across police forces. For that reason, a national licensing authority has been proposed to provide central oversight, and to ensure the consistent application of licensing procedures. Such an authority would also have the advantage of removing the police from the administrative aspect of firearms licensing, and will allow them instead to focus on the enforcement of gun controls. The financial burden of the licensing regime could also be removed from the police while ensuring that public safety remains paramount. In evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, Bedfordshire police presented a cost analysis that showed that the firearms application fees in place since 2000 never represented the true cost to the forces processing applications. Rather than the current firearms certificate fee of &#163;50, a fee of &#163;150 has been proposed. I am not advocating that&#8212;an appropriate fee could be determined by any new central licensing authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.1/1">There are concerns across the piece. Whether air guns are covered depends on the definition of air gun, but I hope to come to that in a few moments if my hon. Friend bears with me.</p>
	<p pid="c.349.1/2">Public safety must be the primary aim of gun control legislation, but it is clear that the police, in view of significant budget cuts, can no longer afford to subsidise the licensing system. We heard in the debate a few moments ago of hon. Members&#8217; concerns about 20% cuts in police budgets in their areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. We are only a few weeks away from the elections for police and crime commissioners. I have discussed the issue with Ron Hogg, who is a PCC candidate in County Durham, and who has some expertise in the matter. It is important that this is a local priority, but I also suggest that we should have a national framework laying down guidelines&#8212;something stricter than guidelines, in fact&#8212;to be applied evenly. Part of the problem is that we have a patchwork of arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.349.3/2">We cannot do firearms licensing on the cheap at the risk of compromising public safety. There is also a strong case for strengthening the link between the licensing authority and medical professionals when considering an application or a renewal of a firearms certificate. We need early and proactive intervention when a firearms holder&#8217;s mental and physical health deteriorates.</p>

	<p pid="c.349.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does he agree that public safety would be improved if a prohibition was placed on the private storage of firearms in people&#8217;s homes, if people with a firearms certificate were subject to an annual medical test to assess continually whether they were a fit and proper person to hold one, and if a public register was available so that the general public knew who had access to a firearm? The atrocities that we see are often committed by people who have been deemed a fit and proper person when originally given a firearms certificate.</p>

	<p pid="c.350.3/1">I hope I have made that point. I am not proposing that people with a legitimate need to hold firearms, such as farmers and so on&#8212;there is a whole list of such people&#8212;are not allowed to hold them. That need should be declared as a reason for holding a certificate, and the police or the licensing authority would take it into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/2">In a case in my constituency in 2008, Michael Atherton had his weapons revoked following threats to self-harm, and issues relating to mental health and gun ownership were also a factor in the case of Christopher Foster, who shot his wife, his daughter and himself after confessing suicidal thoughts to his GP.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/3">I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers and the British Medical Association have an agreement whereby the police alert GPs to any new applications and renewals of firearms licences. However, concerns remain where an applicant fails to disclose full and accurate medical information at the time of application or renewal. Applicants are required to provide a number of medical details, including whether they suffer from any</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/4">&#8220;medical condition or disability including alcohol and drug&#8230;conditions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/5">They also have to declare whether they have ever suffered from epilepsy or been treated for</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/6">&#8220;depression or any other kind of mental or nervous disorder&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/7">However, that information is not routinely checked. Licensing officers approach medical professionals only when there are doubts about an applicant&#8217;s medical history, although Dr John Canning&#8212;again, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on behalf of the BMA&#8212;stated that GPs are &#8220;not very often&#8221; asked to provide medical evidence, although it happens &#8220;from time to time&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/8">Following the case of Christopher Foster, the Independent Police Complaints Commission proposed in 2008 that the licensing force should be required to approach the applicant&#8217;s doctor in each case, in order to obtain confirmation that the medical information provided</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/9">in the application was correct. The omission of information from a firearms application was also an issue in the case of Mark Saunders in 2006, which ended in him being killed by the Metropolitan police. Mr Saunders failed to declare during the application process that he had been treated by a consultant for depression and for his tendency occasionally to drink more than was sensible&#8212;indeed, he had been referred by his GP. Unfortunately, on his application for a firearms licence he stated that he had no such health problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/10">In my view, the solution is to ensure that each applicant knows that licensing officers will approach their GP as a matter of course to verify statements made on their application about their health, to ensure they are correct and accurate. My proposal would address failures by an applicant to disclose any medical problem that raises questions about their suitability to own and have free access to a firearm. Finally, I call for greater consultation between the licensing authority and those who are or have been a domestic partner of a potential applicant. A similar system is already in place in Canada, where all citizens applying for a firearms licence are required to have their present and past partners in the previous two years sign their application. Refusal to sign for any reason does not automatically mean that the police and licensing authorities will veto an application, but it will trigger further investigation by law enforcement officers. The Canadian requirements merit further exploration, and I would appreciate it if the Minister informed the House of any progress made on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.350.3/11">There has been no knee-jerk reaction. These proposals are considered, practical measures that, if implemented, could allow the consistent application of firearms legislation, strengthen existing safeguards and ensure public safety while maintaining the rights of the shooting fraternity to have access to firearms where there is a good and legitimate purpose for their use.</p>

	<p pid="c.351.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" name="Grahame Morris">the hon. Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris)</phrase> both on securing the debate and on the tone in which he has addressed this issue, following the tragic events in his constituency. The shootings he talked about shocked the whole country. Obviously our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the victims. I agree with him: it is right that Government and Parliament should reflect on what lessons might be learned from these fortunately rare, but nevertheless tragic events, and how best we can protect public safety. I and the whole House&#8212;indeed, it is good to see so many people at an Adjournment debate&#8212;share his view that we need to approach the issues in a calm and measured way.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, Durham constabulary has asked the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate the events leading to the shootings. There has not yet been a coroner&#8217;s inquest into the deaths. Because of the investigation and a future inquest, the House will appreciate the need for me to avoid saying anything that might be prejudicial in relation to the circumstances of this case.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/3">I understand that there have been complexities with the IPCC investigation, although it is working through those matters as fast as possible and the investigation is</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/4">now close to completion. The final report is now being finalised and it will be shared with the families shortly. Publication of the report will, however, depend on the time scales for the inquest and the wishes of the coroner. The Government will consider carefully the results of the inquest and of the IPCC investigation, paying careful attention to any specific recommendations that they might make and any implications for wider firearms policy, to which I will now turn as I try to address the specific points that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/5">The Government have always made it clear that controls on firearms should be targeted fairly and proportionately, and that they should strike the right balance by securing public safety without bearing down unnecessarily on legitimate users. With this in mind, I have arranged meetings with a range of stakeholders since assuming responsibility for this work. I met Deputy Chief Constable Andy Marsh, the Association of Chief Police Officers&#8217; lead on firearms, this week, and we discussed a number of the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised today.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/6">Following the tragic shootings in Cumbria in 2010, the Government undertook to take a fresh look at firearms law and subsequently considered the recommendations of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which looked comprehensively at the whole range of issues. The Government published our response to the Committee&#8217;s report in September 2011. Our response sets out a number of commitments in response to the Committee&#8217;s recommendations. The Government will update the Committee, and the House, shortly on progress on those recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/7">As the hon. Gentleman has said, it is generally recognised that the UK has comparatively low levels of gun crime, and some of the strictest gun laws in the world. It is true that these laws are complex, and I would therefore like to give a brief overview of the main controls that are in place. There are two main categories of firearms licensed by the police. First, there are those that are controlled under section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968. They are typically target shooting rifles and rifles used for hunting or vermin control. The second category is shotguns, typically used by farmers and for clay pigeon shooting. Both are possessed by means of separate certificates that are valid for five years. There is a third category of firearm, generally referred to as prohibited weapons, and these can be possessed only with the written authority of the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40104" name="David Tredinnick">the Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick)</phrase> raised the issue of training for Olympic pistol shooters. In advance of the London games, the Home Secretary provided an exemption for this third category of firearms to allow the Team GB shooting team to train here. She is currently in the process of issuing new authorities to British pistol squad members to train for the 2014 Commonwealth games. This is of course subject to the usual checks on applicants and to ensuring that training is confined to suitably secure ranges. The Government will look at arrangements for the 2016 Olympic games in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/9">The hon. Member for Easington raised concerns about how the licensing process operates. I would like to say something about the processes involved&#8212;again, without making reference to the specific circumstances of this case. The procedures are similar for the issue of a shotgun certificate but there are some material differences.</p>
	<p pid="c.351.0/10">First and foremost, the police must be satisfied that the applicant can be trusted to possess shotguns without danger to public safety. Unlike with section 1 firearms, the applicant does not have to show good reason to have a shotgun, but the police may refuse to grant a certificate if they are satisfied that he has no good reason to have one. This is a different control, but it still allows the police to refuse applicants who have dubious reasons for wanting shotguns.</p>

	<p pid="c.353.0/1">I raised a point with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" name="Grahame Morris">the Member for Easington (Grahame M.

	<p pid="c.353.1/1">That would be a matter for the individual force concerned. It is clearly a matter that the police forces that do the licensing, who are responsible and sensitive about these things, would take serious note of.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.1/2">The hon. Member for Easington mentioned national control of firearms and the proposal for a national licensing authority. There is a danger that a central authority might lose touch with the sort of local information that the police need. In his report on the Dunblane tragedy, Lord Cullen recommended that licensing functions should remain with the police. Previous suggestions to replace the current police licensing system with a central civilianised licensing authority have been rejected as more costly and less efficient than the present system.</p>
	<p pid="c.353.1/3">Although the Government are not in favour of a national firearms control board, the Home Office guidance to the police on firearms legislation&#8212;the hon. Gentleman mentioned it, and it is indeed long and complex&#8212;is being revised and updated to help ensure that licensing procedures are applied consistently across forces. This is an important piece of work, responding directly to the Home Affairs Select Committee&#8217;s wish for more consistency. In particular, we will highlight the need to take full account of any incidences of domestic violence when considering applications for the</p>
	<p pid="c.353.1/4">grant or renewal of certificates. The comments that I have heard this evening will be particularly pertinent to that.</p>

	<p pid="c.354.0/1">Does the Minister agree that cost is not an issue here? Where people use firearms for recreation, there is no excuse whatever for the process to be subsidised. It is not a matter of cost; it is purely a matter of process&#8212;and the costs should be covered by those who require a licence.</p>

	<p pid="c.354.1/1">The ultimate driver, frankly, is safety; that is what underlies the system. On the issue of cost, the Home Office has received a detailed report from ACPO proposing new firearms fees to allow forces to recover the cost of firearms licensing. In considering the proposal, the Government will look both at the quality of service licence holders receive, which is relevant, and will discuss with ACPO the scope for making some of the current processes more efficient and effective. That will take into account the need to manage risk and ensure public protection.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/2">As we indicated in our response to the Select Committee, we do not consider that separate licensing for shotguns and firearms is causing difficulties. Applying a good reason test in the same way for both categories could be problematic. For example, unlike target shooters, shotgun owners do not always belong to clubs that could vouch that they had shot regularly. However, I assure the House that we will keep this issue under review. As I indicated earlier, the local police must satisfy themselves that an applicant for a certificate is fit to be entrusted with a firearm, and will not present a danger to public safety. This is a particularly heavy responsibility and sits right at the heart of the licensing process. Such is the basis of my discussions with ACPO.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/3">One of the most important points raised by the hon. Gentleman was about the need for medical checks on those who have access to firearms. I completely agree that it is important that the police are made aware of medical conditions that affect a person&#8217;s suitability to possess firearms. Both the hon. Gentleman and I will therefore&#8212;</p>
