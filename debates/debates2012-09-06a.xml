	<p pid="a.361.7/1">The Department recently completed the biggest ever survey of apprentices and their employers, which revealed the best ever satisfaction rates. Overall, almost 90% of apprentices were satisfied with their training. Employer satisfaction is also high: 88% are satisfied with the relevance of their training, and 80% remain committed to offering places.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.8/1">I welcome the evidence from the Holt review that we need to do more to make apprenticeships accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises. I know from my own apprentices&#8217; business and administration non-vocational qualifications that they are not all user-friendly to the smallest businesses, which are the driver of future jobs. Does the Secretary of State agree that employers in, for example, the Federation of Small Businesses should have more say in the content of courses and in the setting of a reassuring series of national standards?</p>

	<p pid="a.361.9/1">I do agree, but let me preface my remarks by saying what a success story the apprenticeship programme is. Not only has there been a big increase in scale&#8212;more than 60% over the last two years&#8212;but there is a very high satisfaction rate. Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the</p>
	<p pid="a.361.9/2">former Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes)</phrase>&#8212;who has now moved on to higher things&#8212;and to welcome his excellent replacement, who is, indeed, part of an excellent BIS team.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.9/3">The Holt study, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase> mentioned, does acknowledge that there are barriers to SMEs&#8217; access to the apprenticeship programme. We are trying to address them, most notably by channelling resources through employers rather than trainers: that will increasingly be the emphasis of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.0/1">The Jason Holt reforms present great opportunities for the hospitality sector, which has considerable potential for employment export earnings and economic growth, but in which we need to drive productivity gains. As the quantity of apprenticeships continues to increase, how can we ensure that their quality keeps pace with it, or does better?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.362.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="362"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000882">
	<p pid="a.362.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that we need to maintain quality standards. I have asked Doug Richard, an entrepreneur with a background in this area, to give careful consideration to the quality issues and how we can shape the apprenticeship programme around genuine skills training, particularly at skill level 3 and above.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/2">A great deal is happening in the hospitality sector. For instance, Hilton recently offered 100 new apprenticeship places. The Department will shortly hold a round-table discussion about the sector, and apprenticeships will be an important element of that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.362.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40120" speakername="Simon Kirby" colnum="362"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000883">
	<p pid="a.362.2/1">The number of apprenticeship starts in Brighton and Hove was up by 83% last year, with many digital media businesses taking that important first step. Does the Secretary of State agree that that the digital media sector is an important part of the apprenticeship scheme?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.362.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="362"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000884">
	<p pid="a.362.3/1">Yes. Apprenticeships increasingly cover the service sector as well as the traditional manufacturing and construction sectors, and the digital sector is an important part of that. It depends on high technology and high skill levels, and as a result is absolutely crucial.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.362.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40186" speakername="Geoffrey Robinson" colnum="362"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000885">
	<p pid="a.362.4/1">May I put it to the Secretary of State&#8212;as I did on the last occasion when I questioned him on this issue&#8212;that while the overall numbers are very good, there are certain problems in individual sectors such as the construction industry? If we do not ensure that the number of apprenticeships in that important sector is much greater than it is now, we shall find when the national infrastructure plan takes off, as it must eventually&#8212;indeed, with the new team behind it, it will no doubt do so in the very near future&#8212;that we do not have the apprenticeships and the manpower skills in the industry that would enable us to benefit from it.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. The programme must be demand-led and business-led. When a sector is struggling, as the construction sector currently is, that affects the demand for training; but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the sector is well organised, with a</p>
	<p pid="a.362.5/2">levy system and a skills training board. We certainly want to see a substantial number of additional trained specialists in the construction sector, so that we do not have to rely on people coming from overseas to do the work, as we often have in the past.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.363.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40589" speakername="Kate Green" colnum="363"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000887">
	<p pid="a.363.0/1">Although the number of members of ethic minorities who are taking up apprenticeships is improving, there are still patterns of occupational segregation, and ethnic minorities are less likely to be represented in the industry sectors with the best long-term career prospects. What specific steps are the Government taking to ensure that members of ethnic minorities have the chance to take up the best possible apprenticeships?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.363.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="363"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000888">
	<p pid="a.363.1/1">I have not had that case made to me before. Certainly if there is some element of discrimination, that is unacceptable. I guess there might be a correlation with other patterns in the labour force, but I will undertake to see whether there is any evidence of there being a real problem that we need to address.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.363.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40093" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="363"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000889">
	<p pid="a.363.2/1">May I congratulate the Secretary of State on all his new Ministers? I am delighted that he paid strong tribute to the former Further Education and Skills Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes)</phrase>. Given his commitment to vocational education and the personal warmth he brought to his task, he will, as I am sure his successor knows, be a hard act to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.2/2">We now know that over the past year the number of 16 to 18-year-olds starting apprenticeships went down in the south-west, the north-west and north-east England, yet the Secretary of State&#8217;s colleagues elsewhere in Government have so far ducked out of doing anything practical to implement Jason Holt&#8217;s excellent report to get more small businesses to take on those young people. Will the Secretary of State now change that course, with an active Government response to help small businesses to take on young people for the extra apprenticeships that we desperately need, given the failures to deliver growth by No. 11 Downing street?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.363.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="363"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0001.htm#12090626000890">
	<p pid="a.363.3/1">The Jason Holt report was published just six days or so ago, so it is perhaps unsurprising that it has not yet been fully implemented. We are certainly going to be working on it, however. There clearly is an issue with 16 to 18-year-olds who need to have a ladder into apprenticeships rather than going straight into a demanding skill course associated with a job. We recognise that there is that transition issue, therefore, and I am working with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in particular on how we address it.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.6/1">These are tough economic conditions for all sorts of businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, but the small business sector is showing signs of considerable resilience. The number of small and medium-sized enterprises grew to 4.5 million at the</p>

	<p pid="a.364.0/1">I am afraid that is not true in the Cynon Valley. Earlier this week I was talking to small businesses, who said the failure of the banks to lend has made it very difficult for them to expand and take on new workers, such as the former Remploy workers in my constituency who were so disgracefully sacked by the Government last month. We have had enough of the donkey talk of carrots and sticks. Is it not time to hold the bankers&#8217; feet to the fire and get some movement on this matter, because it is not happening now?</p>

	<p pid="a.364.1/1">I have never been shy of criticising bank performance in lending to SMEs, and I am not going to change on that. None the less, I think we should be a little more positive about what is happening. One of the most interesting figures of the last two-and-half years is that the number of private sector jobs has increased by 900,000 in conditions of economic difficulty. Almost all of those jobs are in SMEs, despite the difficulties they face. We are taking action to ensure we get a better flow of funds from the banks, particularly through the new funding for lending arrangements, over and above the guarantee scheme. There are new challenger banks such as Aldermore and Handelsbanken that are specialising in that sector and meeting some of the unmet need.</p>

The fact that the Government have created over 900,000 jobs since the election suggests they are doing a lot of good. Does he also agree that the World Economic Forum report of this week showing that Britain&#8217;s competitiveness has risen from 10th to eighth in the world league, because, it says, of our more efficient labour market reforms, suggests we are doing exactly the right thing?</p>

	<p pid="a.369.0/1">University remains a great route to a rewarding career: 90% of full-time, first degree leavers are in work or further study six months after graduating, and graduates earn on average &#163;100,000 more over their working lives. We recognise the need to do all we can to help universities and businesses to prepare students for the labour market.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.1/1">The Minister might be interested to know that in 2010-11 the university of Winchester recorded that 96% of its full-time teacher training graduates had gone into teaching jobs, but is he satisfied that higher education institutions are doing enough to focus prospective students on the employment prospects they can expect if they choose to study and spend significant sums of money at their institutions?</p>

	<p pid="a.369.2/1">I congratulate the university of Winchester on that excellent achievement. That is why this month we are introducing, for the first time, a requirement that universities release the information on the percentage of their leavers who are in work after six months, course by course, so that prospective students can assess their performance on that crucial measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.3/1">The Minister is well aware that going to university improves employability, but he will also be well aware that tuition fees are acting as a disincentive for many students.

I know that the Department is looking at this, so will he update us on progress towards achieving a model for those students?</p>

There is no evidence that changes in patterns of university applications are affecting poorer students in particular.

A couple of weeks before, members of the Institute of Directors went further, stating that Government policies to support business were ineffective in every single area, and who can blame them? The Government have failed to deliver on their infrastructure plan, they have failed to get finance to businesses that need it, and they have failed to meet the delivery targets in their 2011 plan for growth. The Government are ridden with indecision. Three marks out of 10 was generous. How many marks would the Business Secretary give the Government given their litany of failure?</p>

There is a major agenda to revive the British economy, but in his question the hon. Gentleman made no reference to this morning&#8217;s housing statement. At the moment, construction is the most difficult sector in the British economy, because of the collapse that took place in the wake of the boom that his party created when in office.

	<p pid="a.383.3/1">I welcome the new Leader of the House and join him in paying a warm tribute to his distinguished predecessor. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40452" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> has given long and distinguished service both in government and to the House. Over the years, he has surprised political pundits with his Lazarus-style tendencies, and perhaps even this time he is merely on a sabbatical and will be back. I also welcome the new Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, and pay tribute to his predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/2">I also welcome the Chief Whip to his new and extremely challenging job. One of the first things he will have to do is console his colleagues who have been sacked in the reshuffle&#8212;and not given knighthoods. If it is any help, I can tell them that, in my experience, being sacked from government does not necessarily mean the end of a Member&#8217;s ministerial career. I returned to government in a subsequent reshuffle&#8212;under a new Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/3">Over the summer, the Olympics and Paralympics have shown the best of our country, and I salute the tremendous achievements of all our athletes and those who volunteered during the games, who contributed to making it such an inspirational summer. I pay particular tribute to those at the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40212" name="Tessa Jowell">the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Dame Tessa Jowell)</phrase>, who did so much to bring the games to this country and make them a success. Also, in the spirit of cross-party unity and wanting, as always, to be helpful, may I single out the part played by the Mayor of London? No one has asked him whether he is a man or a mouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/4">Speaking of the Prime Minister, after his disastrous summer, it is hardly a surprise that we have had yet another Government relaunch. After the reshuffle, we have a new right-wing Justice Secretary, an Environment Secretary who is a climate change sceptic and an Equalities Minister who has voted against almost every piece of equality legislation. So now we know: at the end of the rose garden, turn right. Given her record, can the Leader of the House arrange for an urgent statement from the new Equalities Minister, so she can inform the House of her unique approach to her brief?</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/5">The new Secretary of State for Health said before the election that a Conservative Government would &#8220;crowd-source&#8221; ideas, because Conservatives believe in collective wisdom. Will the Leader of the House commend the Chancellor for going to the Olympics stadium the other night to do his own little experiment with crowd-sourcing, and can he tell us what the Chancellor will be doing with the answer he got?</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/6">What the British people want is not yet another Government relaunch, but a real plan for jobs and growth, because the Chancellor&#8217;s economic policies have failed spectacularly. We now have an economy in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. Growth forecasts have been cut and borrowing is up by a quarter. The Prime Minister has been on &#8220;Daybreak&#8221; this morning making announcements that should have been made to this House. When will he learn that cosy chats on the &#8220;Daybreak&#8221; sofa are no substitutes for a statement to this House? We should not have to rely on urgent questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/7">The Deputy Prime Minister said in an interview with <i>The Guardian </i>over the recess that, given the economic situation, it was right to increase taxes on the very wealthy. The next day the Chancellor rubbished the idea. After the reshuffle, does the new roving Economic Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, have the casting vote? With the excitement of the Olympics, I thought I must have forgotten about the Liberal Democrats joining us in the Lobby to vote against a Budget that gave a huge tax cut to millionaires, but according to <i>Hansard</i> the Liberal Democrats voted for it. After the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s disastrous performance at the Dispatch Box this week, the new</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/8">Leader of the House might find it difficult to coax him back to the Chamber any time soon, but can he try to get us an urgent statement? The impression at the moment is that the Deputy Prime Minister is saying one thing in public and voting the opposite way in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.3/9">I look forward very much to working with the Leader of the House. I hope that he can set out his views soon on the proposed House business committee. In the meantime, will he put all our minds at rest, on this first occasion at the Dispatch Box, and rule out a top-down reorganisation of the House of Commons?</p>

	<p pid="a.385.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her welcome. I am also grateful for her very warm tribute to my predecessor. I know that the House will very much appreciate the intention that he should be further honoured, as a Companion of Honour. It is a rare honour, but one that reflects the regard in which we all hold him.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/2">The hon. Lady is quite right: I recall at the last business questions before the recess that the House was looking forward to the Olympics and Paralympics. In truth, I think all our expectations have been wonderfully exceeded. It has been a most inspirational event, and not only inspirational for a generation, as it was intended to be, but a fabulous showcase for what this country can achieve. We, the Government and the people of this country will be able to depend on that reputation across the world in years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/3">The hon. Lady asked a number of questions and made a number of points. Let me tell her that the changes in the Government are all about ensuring that we take forward our reforms and our focus on growth. All of us, as the Prime Minister absolutely said, recognise the difficulties that we encountered when we came into government. We know&#8212;and have known for two and a half years&#8212;how difficult they are. In a sense, they have been added to by the problems in the eurozone and the international economic situation. We are not alone in the problems we have to face, so we are focused on growth, and that will be true, as the Prime Minister has rightly said, in every Department&#8212;whether in the Department for Education, in developing the skills, the qualifications and the standards that are required; in the Foreign Office, which has been focused on delivering trade and investment, and business relationships across the world; or in the Department for Communities and Local Government, in using the powers that the Localism Act 2011 gave to local authorities and the new planning arrangements to deliver increased growth and build jobs. That is what it will mean in all those Departments. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that the Labour Government were responsible for the mess that the country was in in 2010, whereas this Government are focused on getting the country out of that mess.</p>

The law allows for that, and employers are generally good at being reasonable in accommodating people&#8217;s religious beliefs. We believe that the law as it stands strikes the right balance between the rights of employees and employers. We also believe that it is better for the UK to look after its own laws, rather than being forced into a change by a European court.

For example, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there recently to see how new investment was going to the north-east as a result of the enterprise zones.

My colleagues in the Ministry of Defence are, through Army 2020, setting about the process of changing not the size but the shape of the armed services, particularly the Army. In that context, they are looking for something that is sustainable, not least because the Army recruits from across the country. I have already mentioned the opportunity for Members to talk to Ministers about this, but in addition, I hope that Members will recognise that this is the sort of issue that is worth raising in the pre-recess Adjournment debate on Tuesday week.</p>

When watching the Olympics on my big television, I often noticed the red and white hackle of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. These soldiers were brought in quickly in an emergency to sort out a problem. I reiterate what colleagues and friends on both sides of the House have said: we need to debate what is happening to English regiments, which may well be needed quickly in the future.

	Housing and Planning

	<p pid="a.400.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning. The coalition Government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s, and there was a top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment and a regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation. After six years of preparation, by the general election fewer than 60 councils had completed local plans. The result was no development, no regeneration and no community benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/2">This Government want to get the economy growing, to remove unnecessary red tape and to support locally-led sustainable development. In November, the Government published a comprehensive housing strategy to support a thriving, active and stable housing market. In March, we published a national planning policy framework that condensed 1,000 pages of central planning guidance into just 50. House building is up; it was 29% higher in 2011 than in 2009. However, there is much more to do. So, my Department is announcing a further series of common-sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth. The technical details were set out in a written statement that I laid before the House, but I will now summarise the key points for hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/3">Following on from Sir Adrian Montague&#8217;s independent report on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing &#163;200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes. Thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the previous Government&#8217;s deficit, we are passing on lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to &#163;10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing. We will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding. We also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The previous Government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces, through John Prescott&#8217;s pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use. In total, we will invest another &#163;300 million in these measures to support new affordable homes and to bring empty homes into use.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/4">We actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament, despite a Labour pledge to increase it by 1 million. We are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first-time buyers, with an additional &#163;280 million of funding helping up to 16,500 first-time buyers to purchase a home. To free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other Government Departments. We will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally supported large sites. Just last week, we were able to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet valley, a major ex-industrial site that had been stalled for more than a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/5">We are working with local communities and councils, in strong contrast to the previous Government&#8217;s top-down plans for the so-called &#8220;eco-towns&#8221;, which failed to deliver a single home. But some councils need to raise their game, as they are failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty, both for local residents and local firms. We will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure. Some complex developments take time to assemble, so we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions. We will make it easier for developers to change unrealistic section 106 agreements negotiated at the height of Labour&#8217;s unsustainable economic boom; these are houses built on foundations of sand which are no longer economically viable after Labour&#8217;s bust. A development that is not built means no section 106 payments. Common-sense reform will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/6">Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards, so I can confirm that we will protect the green belt, in line with our commitment in the coalition agreement. It has always been the case that councils can amend local green belt boundaries should they wish, and we support councils that choose to do so. They can introduce new green belt protection around new large developments. There is considerable previously developed land in many green belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of that land, while protecting the openness of the green belt, in line with the requirements of the national planning policy framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/7">If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population increasing footfall and supporting local shops. As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements, such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for households. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way should provide a particular boost for small traders and builders. By contrast, the Labour Government wanted to tax conservatories with a council tax revaluation on family homes. The difference could not be clearer.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/8">These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play. They give more power to individuals, to communities and to councils. They provide new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth. They deliver sustainable development and get the business of building under way. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.401.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his oral statement and for the fact that he graciously offered one after my urgent question had been granted. But, once again, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have major changes in policy being announced first to the media and not to the House. We also notice that the Secretary of State has been uncharacteristically silent in recent weeks, while the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor have all been busy changing policy that we all thought he was responsible for.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/2">The Government know that we have a housing crisis, but it is a crisis of their own making. Housing starts fell by 10% last year and affordable housing starts fell by a catastrophic 68%&#8212;that was a direct result of the cut in Government funding for affordable housing, which the Secretary of State allowed to happen. The Chancellor has put the economy back into double-dip recession, those who are looking to buy are finding it hard to get mortgages or to raise the deposits needed, and house builders who already have planning permission are not progressing those developments because they do not think that people will buy the houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/3">We support measures that will help growth and build more houses&#8212;including the debt guarantee&#8212;and help first-time buyers. Indeed, we have been urging the Government to bring forward investment in housing. Will the Secretary of State tell the House when he expects that the number of affordable housing starts, which was only 15,000 last year, will match the 54,000 starts achieved in 2009-10 by the last Labour Government? Will he also tell us how many families have benefited to date from the NewBuy scheme?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/4">The fundamental problem is not the planning system and not section 106 agreements, which are very important in providing much-needed affordable housing. The Local Government Association reports that planning permission is already in the system for 400,000 homes&#8212;it is the Chancellor&#8217;s failed economic plan that is preventing them from being built.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/5">On section 106, how many affordable homes does he anticipate will now not be built because of his proposed changes, given that the National Housing Federation said this morning that section 106 provides 35,000 affordable homes a year? Will any replacement homes that manage to be built be built on the same development sites so that we can have mixed communities?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/6">The Deputy Prime Minister suggested on the radio this morning that at present developers have to wait five years before they can renegotiate section 106 agreements. Will the Secretary of State confirm that those agreements can in fact be renegotiated at any time if the parties agree and that a number of local authorities have been doing exactly that because of the current economic circumstances? What evidence will developers be required to produce to show that a scheme is not viable? Will he clarify whether the proposed changes apply only to existing section 106 agreements or also to new ones, given that only last month he announced that for</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/7">&#8220;all planning obligations agreed after <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase>, the period will remain at five years&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/8">This morning, the Secretary of State has also just announced in his written statement&#8212;I notice that he did not refer to it in his oral statement&#8212;a bombshell that threatens local decision making on planning decisions. The written statement laid before the House this morning states that if an authority</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/9">&#8220;has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/10">we must ask who will judge that quality&#8212;the Government propose</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/11">&#8220;to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/12">Can he explain why, having consistently denounced centralised decision making, he is now proposing a fundamental change? This is not a technical detail, but</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/13">a fundamental change in which he proposes to take the power in future to decide whether he thinks that local planning decisions are up to scratch. If he does not, planning power will be taken out of the hands of local people. So much for localism. Does he not realise that that will cause alarm up and down the country, including among those on the Benches on both sides of the House?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/14">We have read a great deal about the Chancellor&#8217;s wish to undermine the green belt, which is much valued by all of us. Will the Secretary of State clarify what is happening? The Chancellor says that it will change, but the Secretary of State says that it will not. Who is right? Why is this shambles occurring?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/15">When does the Secretary of State plan to publish more details on the relaxation of permitted development rights? Will the current height restrictions be maintained? Will he confirm that that will not apply to conservation areas and that where article 4 directions are in place they will remain in place?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.0/16">Having completed the biggest change in planning policy for a generation earlier this year and trumpeted its success, the Secretary of State, in an extraordinary spectacle, has stood up before the House and, in effect, told us that his planning system is not fit for purpose. When will Ministers stop casting around for somebody and something else to blame, finally admit that it is the Chancellor&#8217;s failed economic policy has led to a collapse in house building and change course?</p>

	<p pid="a.403.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for what I think was a partial welcome for these measures. The previous planning Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, had occasion to compare the right hon. Gentleman, whom we all love greatly, to Lady Bracknell. Today, he acceded to Lady Bracknell sucking a wasp.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/2">Given the party the right hon. Gentleman represents, he should remember that under the previous Labour Government the number of social housing units fell by just under 500,000. He wonders why the housing position was so difficult; it was the stewardship of his party that caused the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/3">Let me deal with the various questions that he asked. We will publish the figures on NewBuy very shortly, but I am sure that he will be pleased that it has been welcomed by the sector. That gives people the opportunity to get quality houses that are newly built. On affordable housing, he seems to have missed the point of the statement. We are talking about building additional social houses and will be building up to 15,000. We should celebrate that. The problem with Labour&#8212;I say this with lots of respect&#8212;is that it seems to think that because a plan has been passed it happens. If social housing is uneconomic and developers build nothing, it does not matter if the ratio for social housing is set at 50%, because 50% of nothing is still nothing. There needs to be a dose of realisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/4">There seems to be a misunderstanding among Labour Members about section 106. It can be enormously helpful to builders and gives social housing in certain parts of the country where there is high demand a ready and available customer. In some parts of the country,</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/5">however, there have been unrealistic views about what is possible and that is holding back development. That is why earlier this year I wrote to local councils and asked them carefully to consider the process of renegotiation. I am very pleased that, as the right hon. Gentleman said, about 40% responded. I commend them for that and they should be regarded as heroes and as part of the process. However, there still remain a significant number of authorities that have refused to accept the economic realities and that regard this as a badge of honour&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.404.1/1">I will happily name and shame them in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/2">The question of the green belt is very straightforward. I think people forget what the green belt is about. It is there to act as a buffer between the major conurbations. A certain degree of tricksyism occurred under the previous Government, whereby they said that the green belt was growing but essentially pinched the green belt from high-pressure areas where it was needed and redesignated it in places where it was not. We want to make it absolutely clear that the green belt is immensely important, both to London as a green lung and to the wider countryside as part of ensuring that our communities are sustainable. Within the green belt, however, is a lot of land that was previously developed: unused quarry sites and scrap yards, for example. It seems to me to be common sense that we should be able to use this opportunity to swap land&#8212;to take a greenfield site that is not in the green belt and to put it in, and to use the former developed land to get development going.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked about permitted development rights and I fully recognise that he is a millionaire and an aristocrat, who is probably unused to being able to measure land other than in acres, but speaking as a working class lad who is proud to own a detached house and whose garden is smaller than the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s croquet lawn, I must say that we will clearly retain the rights to ensure that the curtilage of houses is respected. Nobody will be able to build beyond halfway up their garden as a maximum and we will not be building enormously into the sky. All those things are related and we will not be building a big extension on Dove cottage in Grasmere.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.2/1">I thank the Secretary of State for today&#8217;s innovative announcement and for the written statement. I particularly welcome the regeneration aspect, which will be led by the community, hand in hand with developers.

	<p pid="a.404.3/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Of course this is about localism; it is about working closely with local authorities.

	<p pid="a.405.0/1">We have heard much talk today about affordable housing and social housing. The reality of social housing in London is that between April and September last year only 56 new social rented homes were started, in a city of 7 million people. Is that acceptable?</p>

	<p pid="a.405.1/1">That is why these measures are necessary and why we will be working hand in glove with London local authorities. Only yesterday I heard a quotation used in the housing debate stating how well things were going with regard to social housing in London and praising Mayor Johnson, indirectly, for that process. The hon. Lady should not be confrontational. She should join us so that we can work together, hand in hand, to increase the amount of social housing and affordable housing. That is certainly our intention and why an additional sum for flexibility, including guarantees on borrowing and the like, will be available to help the process.</p>

I pay tribute to her hard work locally on that and am pleased that additional anti-flood measures have been put in place. Clearly that is something we have to consider, but I am sure that she will recognise that the conservatories and extensions will not be freestanding; they will be part of existing dwellings.</p>

	<p pid="a.405.4/1">The statement is a continuation of the Government&#8217;s attacks on the planning system as being responsible for all our ills. The only difference, of course, is that now the planning system they are attacking is the one the Secretary of State has just created. I wish to ask two simple questions. First, how can it possibly be localist to transfer planning decisions at first instance from elected local councils to the Planning Inspectorate? Secondly, how can we have any assurance that the number of affordable houses being built will increase when there is not a single mention here of the role of local authorities in building homes and when the number of homes built for housing associations will decline as section 106 agreements are revisited?</p>

	<p pid="a.405.5/1">The hon. Gentleman has considerable experience in these matters, so I am surprised by his reaction, because this is about working hand in hand with local people. There might be a degree of muscular localism about it, but we will work together with good local authorities. It is only those local authorities that have been dragging their feet and being wholly unrealistic, operating in a kind of economy la-la land, that we will be dealing with. He should see this as an act of help and</p>
	<p pid="a.405.5/2">friendship towards local authorities, many of which have responded magnificently to the process of getting houses built. After all, the Labour party never contemplated anything like the guarantee we are offering on social houses; it was too radical for it.

	<p pid="a.406.0/1">Section 106 agreements have been a really important vehicle for providing affordable housing. If such an agreement is renegotiated for sound and independently assessed reasons, will the council involved be provided with alternative means to provide those much-needed homes?</p>

	<p pid="a.406.1/1">Absolutely. The alternative means will be a touch of realism about the process, which will help. My hon. Friend makes an important point. As well as the process of renegotiation, we are looking at being able to deliver an additional 15,000 affordable homes, on top of what we have already announced. It is a measure of the kind the Opposition would never have dared advocating. I know that she is a keen observer of the media, so she might recall that when the former Prime Minister was interviewed on &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; he said that the housing market was essentially a private one and that there was a good case for the withdrawal of much of state aid.</p>

This proposal will enhance what we are already doing. After all, there is no policy change. Basically, there are a couple of smaller changes&#8212;one introduces a three-year extension and the other refers to section 106, which we were already consulting on.

The Local Government Association helpfully points out that there are about 400,000 permissions for dwellings. That strengthens our case, because a lot of those developments are locked by section 106. We will go about them on a case-by-case</p>
	<p pid="a.408.6/2">basis, and developers will have to demonstrate that the development is uneconomic in order for the section 106 provision to be renegotiated.

May I ask him to be mindful of the fact that in Somerset, the area I represent, housing is very expensive, which has an impact on rents? In dispersed rural communities, there is a serious danger that when small homes are extended their price becomes out of reach to single people, first-time buyers or people starting new families. Will there be some protection to make sure that small homes do not get lost in the system?</p>

	<p pid="a.409.5/1">There are certain restraints on small homes, which is why the existing policy on permitted development rights was 3 metres for houses. This would extend it to roughly 6 metres, provided it does not extend beyond half the garden. I use the example of conservatories just for shorthand&#8212;this is clearly about extensions. We should bear in mind that extensions also fulfil a social need. Often, people want a larger home to take care of an elderly parent, or they may want to take in a member of their extended family. I do not think that we should forget that this will also generate quite a lot of money in the local economy.</p>

Part of the problem, particularly with the green belt, which is there as a quality buffer between conurbations, is the suggestion that this suddenly means that it will be open season on the green belt. That is clearly not the case. The green belt is what makes this country what it is, but not every little bit of it is a beautiful, shining field&#8212;some of it is a scrapyard and some of it is a disused quarry. We can see what can be done for quality housing simply by taking a day trip to Kent to look at what we have done in Ebbsfleet.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.1/1">Due to low incomes and high property values, there is enormous demand for secure-tenancy, regulated-rent housing in the far south-west. How will the Government ensure that that highly localised demand for social housing will be met, and that the new funds that are being made available for social housing will not end up in other areas of the country where demand is less acute?</p>

	<p pid="a.416.2/1">My hon. Friend should take the advice that I have given to a lot of Members, which is that they should go and see their local authority, talk to developers and get the bids in. One of the things that we have been keenest on has been getting private money into social and affordable housing, which the Labour party was also keen to do. Following the Montague report, we have a real chance to do that. That is why additional money has been made available to pump-prime the system. I hope that all Members will work actively with their local authorities and developers to build things that they can be proud of.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.3/1">When the Secretary of State mentioned Grasmere, my thoughts turned to the wonderful Lake District national park on this splendid autumn day. That national park authority, like some others in England, gives planning permission only for local affordable housing. Has he given any thought to how his proposals, which I broadly support, will be implemented in national parks, and has he consulted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on that matter?</p>

We do not want artificially to change parts of the country that rely heavily on tourism, with which the nation is familiar and where it spends its leisure time. The nation is rightly proud of buildings in such areas.</p>

In fact, I think I was the only person not waiting by my telephone yesterday.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to reduce immigration to a level that will stabilise the UK&#8217;s population as close as possible to its present level and, certainly, significantly below 70 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/3">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> and the Backbench Business Committee for providing time for the House to debate this topic, which is of fundamental importance to the future of our country and which badly needs to be addressed on more occasions in this House and the other place. I welcome the new Minister for Immigration, with whom I hope the cross-party group on balanced migration will be able to have as good a relationship as we did with his predecessor.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/4">This debate is in response to a petition launched by Migration Watch UK on the Government&#8217;s website last autumn, which acquired more than 100,000 signatures within a week. That clearly indicates the grave public concern about the scale of immigration to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/5">We can, of course, all agree that immigration is a natural and essential part of an open economy. There is absolutely no doubt that many immigrants make a most valuable contribution to our society, and I hope that we can take that as read in this debate. The real issue that must concern the House and all our fellow citizens is the scale of immigration. Heads must come out of the sand.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/6">We are currently experiencing the greatest wave of immigration to our country in nearly 1,000 years. One of the worst of the many appalling legacies that the last Labour Government, in their folly, bequeathed this country was their chaotic, ill thought out and deeply irresponsible policy on immigration, which has led to bogus colleges being allowed to flourish by the hundred; nearly half a million asylum files being found lying around in warehouses; a Home Office that, after a decade of Labour government, was declared by Labour&#8217;s own Home Secretary to be &#8220;not fit for purpose&#8221;; a new so-called points-based system that has turned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare; and a fivefold increase in net immigration from 50,000 when Labour came into government to 250,000 when it left.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.3/1">I will not; I will continue, if I may. The outcome was a total of 3.5 million foreign immigrants, during which time 1 million British citizens left our shores. As the Institute for Public Policy Research put it,</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/2">&#8220;It is no exaggeration to say that immigration under new Labour has changed the face of the country.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/3">All that took place in the teeth of public opinion, and without any proper consultation or debate. Public concern&#8212;indeed anger&#8212;has been mounting, and opinion polls paint an unmistakable and chastening picture. There are, of course, positive aspects. All of us know that immigration has had a positive effect on entrepreneurial</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/4">skills, premier league football, film, music, art and literature, as well as on food and restaurants. None of that is in dispute but, as I have said, the issue is one of scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/5">The most immediate effect of the wave of immigration has been on our population. The results of the 2011 census show that in the past 10 years, the population increase in England and Wales was the largest for any period since census taking began in 1801. Looking ahead, if net migration continues at 200,000 people a year&#8212;the average over the past 10 years&#8212;we will find that our population hits 70 million in 15 years&#8217; time.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.3/6">Let us be clear about what that means. We would see a population increase of 7.7 million people, nearly 5 million of whom would be purely as a result of new immigrants and their children. Numbers of that kind are hard to grasp, so let me put it like this: in the coming 15 years, just for new immigrants and their families, we will have to build the equivalent of eight of the largest cities outside the capital&#8212;Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Bristol and Glasgow&#8212;together with the associated social infrastructure of schools, roads, hospitals, railways and all the rest. Perhaps those who support the continuation of mass immigration will explain where the money will come from to cope with such numbers, particularly at a time when the Government are borrowing &#163;1 for every &#163;4 they spend.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.1/1">I will not. There are some who try to wave away those figures on the basis that they are only projections. The fact is, however, that for the past 50 years the Office for National Statistics has been accurate to plus or minus 2.5% on its 20-year projections. The other claim is that Britain is not really crowded. That, of course, is a matter of opinion, and the public are crystal clear on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/2">Faced with that chaotic situation, the Government have gone about things in the right way. They have carried out a careful and thorough review of the three major immigration routes: students, economic migration and marriage. I commend my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the former Immigration Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" name="Damian Green">the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase>, for their grasp of the issues and their determination to tackle them.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/3">This House should be under no delusion: the public demand and expect the Government of this country to deal with and fix these matters. The most recent numbers are rather disappointing, but it is too early to expect any substantial effect on net immigration. Last week&#8217;s figures apply only to the first full year of the coalition Government, and that time was needed to review the complex system that they inherited.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.3/1">I will not because I have a very short period of time in which to speak. Of course, the rules cannot be changed for those who have already arrived. Numbers will come down, but a renewed effort is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/2">Where should that effort lie? I do not suggest any early changes to the regulations on economic migration. Business needs stability and predictability, as well as a system that works quickly and effectively. The first priority, therefore, must be to reshape the shambolic points-based system that was introduced in the last years of the Labour Government and has resulted in hundreds&#8212;about 800&#8212;pages of guidance, as well as enormously long forms to be filled in by applicants for visas or work permits. I will be writing to my hon. Friend the Immigration Minister about some particularly disgraceful and inefficient episodes in that regard, concerning distinguished people who need to come to this country and whom the country wishes to welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/3">Instead of relying on the common sense of an experienced immigration officer, we now rely only on a box-ticking exercise, which is emphatically not the right way to proceed. The last straw was the introduction of the hub-and-spoke system where decisions are often taken in a consulate miles away&#8212;indeed, frequently in a different country altogether&#8212;with none of the local knowledge that is vital in such decisions. The futile attempt to base decisions on so-called objective criteria is, in practice, impossible given the huge variety of circumstances among the 2 million visa applications received every year. Common sense has gone out the window. Bureaucracy has taken over and the Government must deal urgently with the issue and get it fixed.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/4">The Government must now take four steps. First, as I have explained, they must move away from this disastrous experiment and get some rational thought into individual immigration decisions. Secondly, they must greatly expand the number of student interviews to ensure that bogus students are refused. There is clear evidence from the National Audit Office and the Home Office pilot scheme that tens of thousands of bogus students have been admitted to this country in recent years. Thirdly, the Government must reduce the validity of visitor visas to three months, and strengthen the powers of immigration officers so that an element of judgment is reintroduced for visitors as well as students. Finally, they must strengthen the removal system, and especially its link with decisions that visas should not be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/5">That will require further sustained effort over many years. The devil will always be in the detail, but the outcome is of the first and most critical importance for the future and stability of the life of our country. The Prime Minister has given his word that the Government will bring net migration down to tens of thousands. Failure to do so will leave our population rising inexorably, pressure on our already hard-pressed public services building up relentlessly and, as a result, mounting social tension. We must stop that happening. I commend the Government&#8217;s actions thus far, but I warn them, and the House, that the stakes are high. There is a long way to go, difficult decisions to take, and the time scales are unforgiving.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/6">We must all seek at every possible occasion to speak candidly about the serious social and policy implications of mass immigration, and continue to search for an effective, humane and fair way ahead that will command the support of the British people.</p>

I am pleased to accept that I was wrong on both counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.3/3">I am also delighted that another success was not only our tally of medals, but the fact that people who won them had come to this country with their families to make a new life. They were so committed to us that they wanted not only to participate, but to win for this country. How does the Immigration Minister interpret those events? So many people come here and are so committed, and yet at the same time some second generation people harbour such terrible thoughts in their hearts about us that, as far as we know, they want to take terrible action against us.

If the Government are not successful within a 15-year period, if not sooner, our population will go beyond 70 million. As he said, in concrete terms, that means that if we wish to maintain existing living standards rather than see them cut, we must build the equivalent of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Bristol and Glasgow. That must happen during a period when we will experience a more sustained number of years of cuts in public expenditure than we have ever experienced. With those cities must come roads, utilities and the necessary extra schools and health facilities. Does any hon. Member believe that if we are not successful in meeting the Government&#8217;s objective, we will meet the objective of housing people on an equivalent basis to how they are currently housed?</p>

	<p pid="a.423.2/1">I have always underscored those points, but hon. Members who put them to me also need to look at the evidence. What did the House of Lords Committee say about the contribution overall that immigrants make to our economy? It is minuscule. Of course immigrants earn their way and make a contribution, but to think that we are pounds in is mistaken. If hon. Members want to dispute the figures, they will catch your eye, Mr Speaker. I am saying that unlimited migration on the scale that we have seen is not such an economic advantage to this country as some of the proponents of open doors would wish us to believe.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.2/2">I wish to pose another question to the new Immigration Minister: if he accepts those projections, what measures will he take that make a target limit of 70 million people possible? My third question is about the sources of the growth in immigration. If one looks at the net figures, one finds three major sources: people who have work permits; people who, under the conditions, bring their families here; and students. We know that the work permits that the Government make available are not all taken up, so it is not as if work permits are a main driver of the stubborn level of net migration. On people who bring their immediate family over, the figures show that families do not account for a net migration figure each year of in excess of 200,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.2/3">On students, my question is whether the attempt to meet the Government&#8217;s target will mean looking critically and resolutely at the size of the student population that probably stays. We have only one piece of information about students returning home. It was a Home Office survey, which showed that after five years one could account for 20% of students who came here under certain conditions who were still here legitimately to work. We simply do not know what happened to the other 80%.</p>

They were still in this country and had every right to be here: we do not know whether the others went home or not.</p>

In actual fact, some of them were staying on to study because their courses lasted for more than five years and some of them had changed to a different migration route. The only evidence of people staying illegally in that study was 3%, not the 80% that my right hon. Friend mentions.</p>

	<p pid="a.425.3/1">I welcome the newly appointed Minister to the post. He was a popular Minister in his last job, but he will now find it easier to have every Conservative Member&#8212;and many others&#8212;supporting him.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/2">Ever since I became an MP, and indeed since long before, it has been clear to me that we needed to take more seriously people&#8217;s views about immigration. However, both the Liberals and the Labour party took exactly the opposite view. They believed that there needed to be complete concealment from the public on this issue, and anyone who believed to the contrary was a racist. The fact is, however, that many people were becoming so concerned they were prepared to accept being labelled as racists if the consequence was to do anything good on immigration. The number of migrants allowed into this country was far and away in excess of what we needed for economic growth, and many people in all parts of the country were sickened by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/3">Let us go back to the year I was born. We took approximately 3,000 people into the country in 1953. By the 1970s, we admitted an average of 45,000 per year, and that did not include the 27,000 Ugandan Asians from Idi Amin&#8217;s genuinely racist regime. In the 1980s and early 1990s, 54,000 were admitted each year, rising again in 1999 to around 97,000. Let us make it absolutely clear. It was the intention of the Labour party to admit far more migrants than ever before. Its aim was to create a rainbow coalition&#8212;what it succeeded in doing was creating ghettos in many parts of the country. This is something that had long been suspected by Conservatives and was realised with the Labour party&#8217;s draft policy paper in 2001, which was thought to have mentioned &#8220;social objectives&#8221; within its overall migration strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.425.5/1">If the hon. Lady would indicate what is wrong with what I have said, I will change it if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.5/2">In the period between 1997 and 2010, we admitted 200,000 people per year. That is the same as creating a new city the size of Birmingham every five years, not including illegal immigrants as we had no idea where they were. When Lord Howard of Lympne led the party in the election in 2005, we were called racists for wanting to impose effective limits on migration. It was the first real attempt by even the Conservative party to stand up for the people who live here.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.5/3">Labour, under the then Prime Minister, began to see the truth after many years of attack on a small minority of politicians, such as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase> and, even more so, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> for leading the debate. But even during the last election campaign, the then Prime Minister called a pensioner and lifelong Labour supporter a bigot for questioning the scale of migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.5/4">In the 2010 election, we Conservatives promised to reduce the number of migrants to 100,000 per year by 2015. The question is whether we are doing enough, and the answer is clearly no. Our policy is not to offer free health care except in emergencies, to migrants from outside the EU, but there is no effective system in place to enforce that. The same goes for migrants from within the EU. Spain, unlike us, has this system under control, and migrants from the EU cannot get health care unless they produce the right papers. Migrants who intend to live in Spain for more than three months have to produce a job contract or evidence of their ability to support themselves, otherwise their requests will now be denied. We need answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.5/5">There are other points that we need to press more strongly. First, there are still no controls on people coming from the EU. Quite clearly, we must effect such controls. Secondly, there are students. Some of them are false, and we congratulate the Government on how, even this week, they have been reducing their number. On the other hand, however, we do not intend to keep genuine students away. They must fill in the visa forms, and we must make it clear that they are welcome. Thirdly, there are the illegals. We must keep working at them in order to reduce their number, but the law is not 100% behind the Government in this area, and a change from the judges would be much welcomed.

I wonder whether he agrees with me that although we have heard tough words on immigration from both sides of the House, both since the election and before it, what we really need are not only tough words but tough action. That is what we have not seen, but what we need to see from the new Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.4/1">The questions of how many people we need in the UK to sustain the standards of living we all want and of what role immigration can play in answering that question have been taboo subjects for much too long. The reason is that ever since Enoch Powell made his infamous speech in Birmingham back in 1968, most politicians from mainstream parties, with a few exceptions, some of whom have been brave, some foolish and some both, have steered clear of the subject for fear of saying something that would be called politically incorrect and thus being labelled as racist or anti-immigrant by the media. Because mainstream parties and politicians have not debated these issues and the effect that immigration might have&#8212;I say &#8220;might&#8221;&#8212;on jobs, wages and public services, we have left the field wide open to those racist and xenophobic parties that want to talk only about immigration and put their own particular spin on it.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.5/1">I am grateful to hear the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made. It is such an important point. If the House does not debate these issues sensibly, calmly and rationally, we cede the field to the extremist parties, which none of us wants. Does he agree that the most important people in this debate are the hundreds of thousands of British people, of all races, who are looking for work at this moment but are in strong competition with large numbers of immigrants? They are the people whom we must keep in mind. They are of all races and they are British.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.6/1">I was going to come to that issue later, but I thank the hon. Gentleman for making his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.6/2">As has been said, this silence on the questions of how large a population the UK should have and of how much more immigration we should allow is not shared by the wider electorate, who want the issue debated, as is confirmed by opinion polls, all of which list immigration as one of the electorate&#8217;s top concerns. For politicians here to ignore this fact while continuing to peddle the simplistic free-market mantra that immigration always benefits the economy and raises living standards, that immigration, together with the free movement of people and economic globalisation, is wonderful, and that the trickle-down effect benefits everybody, is not only an insult to the people of this country but ignores the pressures that an increasing population puts on public services, particularly housing, health and education, in areas such as mine, which is one of the most multiracial</p>
	<p pid="a.427.6/3">constituencies in the country. It does a great disservice to the cause of good community relations in our multicultural society.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.6/4">I want to say a little more about the myth that immigration brings growth. This myth is peddled usually by elements of big business that do not want the responsibility of training young British school leavers and graduates&#8212;do not forget that 1 million of them are unemployed and cannot get jobs. Instead, these elements want as big a pool of labour as possible, from anywhere in the world, to hire and fire so that they can push down wages and increase profits, shareholder value and, of course, their bonuses. As much research has shown, the reality is that immigration can add a small percentage increase to gross domestic product, but there is no evidence that it benefits per capita GDP or individual living standards for the vast majority of people. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the population see their wages fall and have to face increased competition for social housing, education and health facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.0/1">I agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman is saying.

	<p pid="a.428.1/1">The people who visit my surgeries and constituency meetings come from all different backgrounds, including, as the hon. Lady says, many who came to the country in the 1950s, who put down roots and who have contributed enormously to the vitality and well-being of the great city I live in and to the benefit of the country. They are just as concerned as everybody else about the argument over how many people we need in the country to sustain their living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/2">I do not want to talk about how the UK manages the 1 million-plus visitors and students who come to the UK every year, other than to say that I welcome genuine visitors and students, provided, of course, that like everybody else they comply with the terms of their visas. They should return at the end of their visas. As an aside, however, I wish to refer to something that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> said about the number of people entering and leaving the country. Every year in the 1990s, I consistently used to ask, &#8220;How many people come to this country on short-term visas issued by the Government?&#8221; The answer I got back&#8212;every country was always listed&#8212;usually said that the figure was something like 950,000 to 1 million. That was very illustrative. However, the second part of my question was: &#8220;How many went back?&#8221; The answer was two lines: &#8220;We don&#8217;t keep that information.&#8221; That was absolute nonsense; indeed, it was ridiculous. We need to put back in place a system whereby we count people in and count them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/3">The UK is one of the most crowded countries in Europe. It is not me who said that; it is the European Commission. It estimated that over the next 50 years the figure in the UK would rise by 16 million. Those are not my figures; they are the European Union&#8217;s figures. It predicted that Britain would become the most populous country in Europe by that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.1/4">I represent one of the most diverse and multicultural constituencies in the country. As I said to the hon. Lady, the multicultural make-up of my constituency has added hugely to the vitality of the great city of Birmingham. Immigration into the United Kingdom since the first immigrants came in after the second world war has added enormously to the life of the United Kingdom. I welcome that, but we have to address the issue of how many people we need in the United Kingdom to sustain our standard of living. If we do not, I fear that the good community relationships that have been built up in my city and many others will be threatened. I do not want to see that happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.429.0/1">What a pleasure it is to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40082" name="Roger Godsiff">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr Godsiff)</phrase>, who made a remarkable speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/2">I, too, want to focus on numbers, as the motion does. It is a strange thing that from the early part of the 19th century until past the middle of the last century it was almost universally accepted that overcrowding and over-population was a major driver of poverty. Indeed, in one scheme alone, between 1922 and 1935, more than 400,000 people received Government assistance to emigrate, principally to Canada and Australia. The Office for National Statistics estimated in 2004 that we would have 67 million people by 2031. Six years later, that figure had gone up to 72 million, or 5 million more. Yet there is widespread concern among reputable statistical agencies&#8212;I mentioned the Bank of England as just one that has gone public&#8212;that the ONS has lost count. Indeed, if we look at the detailed way in which it calculates the figures&#8212;in particular, its assumptions about birth rates, which make no adjustment at all for a changing composition&#8212;we find good grounds for thinking that its projections might not be accurate. All are on the same side of the equation&#8212;that is, in every case there are grounds for thinking that the ONS&#8217;s projections are too low, rather than too high.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/3">There is a further issue, which people are very reluctant to address. I hope nobody is going to accuse me of being a racist&#8212;if they do, I am not going to dignify the comment with an answer&#8212;but we have to look at the detail and accept two facts. The first is that the phrase &#8220;net migration&#8221; is misleading. To take the age profile of the people coming in and those going out, it is perfectly absurd in demographic terms to equate pensioners retiring to the sun with young people coming in who have not yet started families.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/4">The second point is that many of those coming in are from areas that have historically had much higher birth rates than the indigenous group. The trend in every country in the world is that birth rates among incoming communities tend to trend towards the national average of the country that they are joining, with one important exception: if those groups do not become absorbed into the wider body. Over the last few years, we have for the first time begun to see the very unsettling picture, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> referred, of some groups not assimilating.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/5">Over the last few weeks, we have rightly felt enormous national pride at the performance of our Olympics team. Nobody needs me to say that the racial mixture&#8212;the original ethnic origins&#8212;of the people who won all</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/6">those medals for Britain, and in many cases of those who did very well but did not get medals, covers the full spectrum of people here. What was much less widely discussed, however&#8212;and what has started to come out only recently&#8212;was a whole string of violent acts by people living round the area against service personnel. Those acts were not only against personnel responsible for guarding the area, but in one case against naval personnel from a visiting ship, to such an extent that I understand that instructions were given out towards the end not to be seen, if possible, in uniform too far from the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/7">I mention that not because I would dream for one second of denying the colossal contribution that so many immigrants have made to this country, nor because I am a racist&#8212;I am incredibly proud of the fact that my grandfather was a member of the Indian army, the largest volunteer force ever raised in the history of this country and drawn from every conceivable religious background and an awful lot of different racial backgrounds in India&#8212;but because we must recognise the important warnings that the right hon. Gentleman gave. We are now starting to attract some groups that do not feel British.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/8">Let me spend the last couple of minutes on a few more statistics that should worry us all. We all believe that every family needs a decent home. I know of no other country, except possibly Japan, where average house prices are seven times earnings despite the recession. House prices here are certainly much higher than in America or Germany, two other prosperous countries where the figures are 4.5 and 4. In London, there is not a single borough left in which one can rent a two-bedroom dwelling for less than 35% of the median earnings, and there are a relatively small number left where the figure is less than a half. We have housing shortages on a scale that is completely unprecedented in the modern era. We have heard a lot of references to infrastructure as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/9">I want to end with students. I am proud of the fact that I represent the area with the largest concentration of students in the country, with four universities wholly or partly in my constituency. I am immensely proud of what we do, taking in foreign students, who bring money to this country and provide us with good will. However, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>, who speaks for the Opposition, was quite wrong in his intervention on his right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead. I have a copy of that study, &#8220;The Migrant Journey&#8221;, with the note from the Library confirming that it was a purely paper exercise. Although the study shows that 21% had a reason to stay in the country, together with thousands of dependants, nothing is known about where the other 79% went.</p>

What is next? Is there going to be internment? This motion might be suitable for the <i>Daily Mail</i> <i>,</i> the <i>Daily Express</i> or some other right-wing rag, but it should not be passed by the House and I urge Members to reject it. It is not worthy of our attention or of our passing it. I will certainly try to divide the House to ensure that it is not passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/5">As for the substance of the debate, we have heard the usual stuff from right hon. and hon. Members.

Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax)</phrase>, because that is exactly the point. The idea that immigration is out of control is nonsense. We know that the Government&#8217;s ambition is to reduce immigration from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. It is not going to happen. What the right hon. Member for Mid Sussex and Members on the Government Benches fail to appreciate is that we live in an interconnected and globalised world where knowledge, ideas, creativity and talent are an international commodity. That of necessity</p>
	<p pid="a.431.6/2">means a transfer of people across continents and countries, and that is good for the global economy; it is good for our economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.1/1">I will not give way any more because I have not got any more time.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/2">We are in the fantastic city of London, the most dynamic and prosperous city in the world. A third of the people who live and work in London come from outwith the UK. It is like in Monty Python&#8212;&#8220;What has immigration done for us?&#8221; It has made London into a fantastic, dynamic, prosperous city.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/3">Conservative Members talk about the Olympics. What I saw was a fantastic celebration of multicultural Britain. I saw the little tweet of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40143" name="Aidan Burley">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Mr Burley)</phrase> and how he got a Twitter monstering for what he said&#8212;deservedly so. He could not have been further from the national mood when it came to how we see what immigration and multiculturalism brings to our country and our nation. It is something that is welcome and is celebrated, and so it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/4">I do not go along with this 100,000 <i>Daily Mail </i>petition that we are now debating. There is a mood change in this country and people are coming to accept and celebrate what we have and see that immigration is a good thing. That should be welcomed&#8212;not this nasty, authoritarian little motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.1/5">I will come now to Scotland. I am sorry if I am boring people by restating that Scotland occupies just over a third of the land mass of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland but has only 8.4% of the population&#8212;less than a tenth. Our issue is not immigration throughout the decades and centuries, it is emigration. We lose people instead of attracting them. Scotland is not full up; Scotland is one of the most under-populated parts of western Europe. Yet we are asked to accept an immigration policy that could almost be designed to be the opposite and contrary to what we require.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.3/1">I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman; I have no more time left.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/2">Scotland&#8217;s population currently stands at a record 5.2 million. For years we feared that our population would sink below the iconic 5 million mark for the first time since the mid-20th century, but we now have 5.2 million, which is good. What distinguishes Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom is that the Scottish Government issued a press release welcoming the fact that our population was at a record high. Can we imagine even the new Minister issuing a press release welcoming the fact that the UK population was at an all-time high? We have to put up with an immigration policy that is designed not for us but for another country. Thank goodness that in a few years we will have an immigration system in line with our own requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/3">Our requirements are huge. We have an ageing population with an ever smaller active work force. We need to address that. We need to attract the best and the brightest to fill our skills gap. Current immigration policy is</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/4">creating havoc with our education sector. In Scotland we are reliant on overseas students. About 19% of the total student body in Scotland comes from overseas, and that is worth about &#163;500 million to the Scottish economy. Almost 10% of all the teaching staff come from overseas, too, because we have three universities in the top 100. People want to come to Scotland because we have this culture, history and heritage of invention and creativity. The Scots practically invented the modern world so of course overseas students want to come to Scotland to study.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/5">Students observe what is happening at the London Metropolitan college and think, &#8220;If I go to the UK there is a good chance that some Minister will decide that my college is not worthy of status and I will not get a course.&#8221; The Government&#8217;s policies are putting people off coming to our universities and colleges, and I urge the Minister to stop them now because they are harming our universities and higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/6">In Scotland we need our own immigration service that will address our needs. We do not need harsher immigration policies. I bet the Minister that he will never get to these suggested levels of immigration. This is the world we live in, and there is no point in trying to address it. The Migration Observatory wrote to every Member of Parliament to give its view, and even it could not agree with the right hon. Members who have proposed the motion. It pointed to variations throughout the United Kingdom in people&#8217;s perception of immigration. I am proud that we in Scotland do not perceive immigration as a dreadful, negative thing as so many Conservative Members seem to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/7">I, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, would like to come to debates such as this to have a proper discussion about immigration. Hon. Members always protest that we do not discuss it properly, but when they get to their feet all we ever hear is that immigration must be curbed or stopped, that it is not a good thing, that it must be reversed.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.3/8">We have a new Minister in his place, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40263" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper)</phrase>. I hope that we will have a better understanding of the issues than the previous Minister because what we are observing just now is not positive or good. As a Scottish National party member, I hope that he will understand that Scotland&#8217;s immigration requirements are different. I do not know if he will acknowledge that, but just a cursory recognition that Scotland is lumbered with a system that is not appropriate for our needs would be welcome and then we could make some progress in how we address this. I live in hope that that might happen, but I have my doubts. Scotland would reject this silly, authoritarian and nonsensical motion, and I hope that the House does too.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.0/1">I should like to start by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> and to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase> for their courage, conviction and determination in tabling the motion. I also thank the Backbench Business Committee for ensuring that the debate was held today; it is a debate that the vast majority of people in this country want us to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/2">I have been involved in local politics and parliamentary politics for some years. My constituency of Crawley is multi-ethnic, and one of the most important issues that people raise with me&#8212;regardless of their ethnic background, although it is often raised by people from an ethnic minority&#8212;is the concern about the sheer number of people coming into this country over the past decade or so. If people continue to enter the country in those numbers, the situation will be unsustainable. A population in excess of 70 million would certainly be unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/3">It is worth repeating that, for far too long, the main political parties and the political establishment in this country have not addressed people&#8217;s concerns about the sheer level of immigration, particularly over the past decade or so. As a result, reasonable people who are not prejudiced or racist have found themselves supporting racist organisations and parties such as the British National party and the so-called English Defence League. That is a great shame, in a country that has traditionally been&#8212;and still is&#8212;one of the most tolerant nations anywhere in the world. It is appalling that our lack of willingness to address the situation has led to those thoughts being held by reasonable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/4">Immigration has played a big part in the history of this nation. There have been various waves of immigration, but we are now, for the first time in a millennium, seeing unsustainable numbers. Some estimates mention 3 million people, but the important point is that we do not actually know the figure because the numbers of people coming to this country are not properly recorded. That has put enormous pressure on our infrastructure. That is evident in my constituency, where the pressure on housing is immense. Areas that were originally designated for commercial development have had to be re-designated as residential development to support the numbers of people coming to live there. That results in pressure on infrastructure&#8212;not just the physical infrastructure such as the highways, but, perhaps most acutely, the schools. Many have had to expand their classroom capacity in quite difficult circumstances to accommodate the numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/5">Mention was made earlier of the pressure that immigration has been putting on the national health service. Next Tuesday, I am pleased to be presenting a ten-minute rule Bill on this issue, which will seek to require a proper audit to be carried out in order to recover reciprocal costs incurred in the treatment of foreign nationals by the national health service. At the moment, the figures are not properly recorded or monitored, but they suggest that the health service is paying more than &#163;1 billion a year on supporting foreign nationals who would otherwise not be entitled to free care.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.0/1">I note what the hon. Gentleman says about the use of the national health service, but does he also recognise the substantial contribution made by immigrants who are employees of the NHS? How does he think the NHS would manage if we were unable to attract migrants to come here and do that work?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.434.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" speakername="Henry Smith" colnum="434"  time="014:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0002.htm#12090626001280">
	<p pid="a.434.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for using the word &#8220;manage&#8221;. That is what has been missing from our immigration system up to now. My wife was an immigrant to this country, and she used to work in the national health service. The hon. Lady is quite right to say that the NHS has relied on people coming to this country to support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.1/2">However, we need an immigration system in which we know who is coming into and leaving the country, and in which those who come in use a fair and lawful route. When the so-called accession eight countries became part of the European Union in 2004, only the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden did not exercise their right to a period of controlled immigration. As we were the largest country not exercising the right to control immigration, and as we are an English-speaking country, we saw millions of people coming here in a rapid and unsustainable way. That has resulted in many pressures in communities up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.1/3">Let me start to conclude by congratulating the Government on the work they have already started to do. I very much welcome the new Minister to his post, and I am sure he will continue the excellent work of his predecessor over the past two and a half years. I am encouraged that the number of net migrants to this country has come down, as recently reported, from more than 250,000 to just over 200,000&#8212;but we still have to go much further. I congratulate the Minister&#8217;s predecessor&#8212;I know that this good work will continue&#8212;in closing down the sham marriage route and the illegal routes to entering this country through bogus college courses. Again, the action we have seen over the past week is to be welcomed, but we need to continue our pressure and our determination to get a grip on this situation. As we heard earlier, it would need eight cities to be built outside London over the next 15 years to accommodate the projected rise in population as a result of immigration, which is clearly unsustainable. I echo other hon. Members in saying that we have a duty to the British people to ensure that we address this issue for our future harmony and prosperity as a nation.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.0/1">In opening the debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the right hon. Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase> talked about the need for honesty and open and candid discussion. I regret that many of the contributions so far have, I think, thrown more darkness than light on the subject. I want to concentrate on one specific thing, which I believe unites many Members on both sides of the House&#8212;the way we address the issue of students. We need to recognise the important role of UK higher education. I welcome the new Minister to his post and hope he will bring an open mind to this issue. I am sure he will be lobbied by Government Members as much as by Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/2">As we were reminded by the Minister for Universities and Science in this morning&#8217;s Business, Innovation and Skills questions, UK higher education is a major export earner. It contributes something like &#163;7.9 billion to our economy annually. It is not just about money&#8212;we recruit some of the best and the brightest to our universities and they add to the intellectual rigour and to the overall educational experience of UK students, as well as play a vital role in research and innovation, which is greatly recognised by British business&#8212;but the direct financial contribution is significant. The money spent through tuition fees is matched by the money spent in local economies. In all our major towns and cities across the country, tens of thousands of jobs are dependent on</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/3">international students. In the city I represent, Sheffield, they are worth about &#163;180 million to the local economy and involve more than 2,000 jobs. It is a major success story, but it could be even better.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/4">Driven by the world&#8217;s growing economies, international demand for university education is expanding rapidly, and BIS estimated that we could double the number of international students in this country by 2025. That would mean another couple of thousand jobs in Sheffield and tens of thousands across the UK. With the world&#8217;s strongest higher education offer after the United States, we should be seeing huge growth, but we are losing market share. The reason for it is the message we have been sending out to prospective students around the world as a result of changes to the student visa system. The Home Office&#8217;s own impact assessment of the student visa changes, published just over a year ago, estimated that its proposal would cost our economy a massive &#163;2.6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/5">At a time when we need growth and should be encouraging our major export earners, I have to say that the situation has been made worse by the handling of the London Metropolitan university issue. Clearly, we need to act if universities are failing in their obligations, but we need to act appropriately and proportionately. How this has been handled, however, has done huge damage. A Google search reveals something like 700 stories in the international media about this issue, and a deeply damaging message is being sent out. They are saying &#8220;You can come to the UK, you can comply with visa requirements, you can pay thousands of pounds for your course and contribute to the local economy, you can be making a success of your studies, and, through no fault of your own, you can still be deported at any time on the whim of Government.&#8221; What would a prospective international student choose to do when confronted with that situation?</p>

	<p pid="a.436.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that enabling overseas students who are investing considerable sums to come here to feel confident that they are coming to a college or higher education institution that is complying with the law is fairer to them than the random, haphazard system that has existed up to now, which can leave genuine overseas students vulnerable?</p>

	<p pid="a.436.1/1">I think that genuine overseas students were left vulnerable by bogus colleges that were recruiting them to fairly bogus courses, but London Metropolitan university is not one of those. There may have been failings in its processes and systems&#8212;the situation is still being investigated&#8212;but the issue is that bona fide students who are succeeding in their courses are being threatened with deportation at a critical stage of the academic cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.1/2">We should bear in mind the message that that sends to prospective students around the world who are considering their options. They will say to themselves, &#8220;Shall I go to the UK? Thanks, but no thanks. I shall go to the United States&#8221;&#8212;or Canada, or Australia&#8212;&#8220;because I shall not be deported from that country on the whim of Government.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.436.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, while it is proper for the system to be policed, the way in which the rules are being applied to students who are</p>

	<p pid="a.437.0/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend, who has made his point very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/2">What worries me is the wider reputational damage to the higher education sector. Losing out in that market is not just about short-term financial loss. Those who study in the UK develop a great affection for the country. When they have returned home and have risen to prominent positions in business and politics, and are making decisions about trade and investment, they often turn first to the country where they studied. Every one of our universities is full of examples of alumni who have contributed to this country on the basis of that relationship.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.2/1">No, I will not. I have given way twice, and I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/2">What can we do to return to our historic position as the destination of choice for the world&#8217;s students? The answer came this morning in the report from the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, echoing the reports from the Home Affairs Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. All those Committees, and Members on both sides of the House, have said that we should remove students from the net migration targets, but it is not just their view. The case was made recently by the director general of the Institute of Directors, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/3">&#8220;International students should not be treated as migrants for the purposes of the government&#8217;s net migration figures&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/4">He said that a</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/5">&#8220;simple statistical change has the potential to neutralise what competitor countries see as a spectacular own goal.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/6">Treating students as migrants damages our universities, but it also distorts the immigration debate because it leads policy makers away from the real issues of concern. Australia&#8212;one of our competitors which is winning the game, building a growing share of the international student market&#8212;has undertaken an instructive journey on immigration. Political concerns led the Australians to tighten student visa rules in 2010. A fall in the number of student applications then led them to commission the Knight review, which recommended changes that have reopened opportunities for international students. In the United States, restrictions imposed after 9/11 have been loosened. The US Department of Homeland Security does not include international students in its numbers for migration policy purposes; it treats them, rightly, in the same way as it treats business visitors and tourists&#8212;as &#8220;nonimmigrant admissions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/7">As I have said, while the Government are right to tackle the problem of bogus students and colleges, we need to avoid throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Taking students out of our net migration targets would enable us to look again at the changes that have been introduced by the Home Office. It could, for example, provide a basis for reviewing the restrictive rules on post-study work, which is a key issue as many prospective</p>
	<p pid="a.437.2/8">students are keen to consolidate their learning in the country of their study. That also has a huge amount to offer our economy. Barack Obama has learned that lesson in the United States. Addressing this debate in the context of his country, he said, &#8220;This is crazy. We&#8217;re taking the best minds from around the world. We&#8217;re bringing them to this country. We&#8217;re giving them the skills to apply in a whole range of areas&#8212;to develop business, to develop the economy&#8212;and then we&#8217;re kicking them out.&#8221; The post-study work route is an important issue, and such work makes an important contribution to the economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.438.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" speakername="Gavin Barwell" colnum="438"  time="014:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0002.htm#12090626001288">
	<p pid="a.438.0/1">May I start by paying tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase> for introducing this debate on what is a hugely important subject? I am surprised that none of my Liberal Democrat coalition partners are present to discuss it. The tone in which the subject is addressed is very important, however. I was thrilled that he emphasised the positive impact migration has made to this country, while also explaining why he felt we needed to reduce net migration significantly. I absolutely agree with him about the issue of scale, too; I support the manifesto on which I stood for election. I do not support the terms of this motion, however, and I want to explain why.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/2">My right hon. Friend rightly said that in the past 10 years the scale of population growth has been greater than at any time since the census process began. It is important to note that the pace of change is not that different from throughout much of the 20th century. The point is that the scale is greater, however, because we are starting from a higher baseline, and Members can reasonably argue that that is harder to accommodate because the population is larger.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/3">I have four concerns about the motion. First, we have never had a formal population target, and I do not believe it would be right to have one. That is in part because of my second reason for not supporting the motion, which is that the population growth over the last 10 years is not solely due to net migration. Office for National Statistics and census data show that about 55% of the population increase is down to migration and about 45% is due to people living longer and also to increased fertility rates&#8212;which is an interesting phenomenon as many other western European countries are not experiencing it, and there is not yet a clear understanding as to why it is happening. If the country were to adopt a formal population target, the Government might have to look at addressing policies such as the number of children that families are allowed to have, and I would be completely opposed to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/4">My third, and most substantive, objection, however, is the costs that would result from the levels of reduction in net migration that this motion would entail. I tried to make that point in an intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>. I admire him greatly, but in order to attain the terms of the motion, which talks about</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/5">&#8220;population as close as possible to its present level and, certainly, significantly below 70 million&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/6">the Migration Observatory evidence shows that we would probably need to have either zero net migration or possibly even net emigration from the country. If we take a net migration figure of 100,000, which would be at the top end of the Government target, the population would be just under 70 million in 2035. This motion is not just calling for the Government to achieve their manifesto commitment, therefore; it is arguing for measures that go well beyond that, and they will have consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.0/7">The Office for Budget Responsibility model that we now all work on assumes that each reduction of 50,000 in migration will result in a 0.1% reduction in economic growth. When the OBR was mentioned earlier, several of my colleagues questioned the reference to it from a sedentary position. I am not an economist or an expert in these matters, but I do know that every Chancellor of the Exchequer must now base their Budget decisions on the figures the independent OBR produces.</p>

	<p pid="a.439.3/1">This is an important point and I want to develop it. As I was saying, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green had it right, because there is clear evidence that migration does have an effect on economic growth, but there is no clear evidence that it has an impact on GDP per head. Those things are both important. GDP per head is important in terms of individual living standards, but if we are passionate about reducing the deficit, the level of economic growth is crucial. It affects tax receipts, the number of people out of work and the income coming into the Treasury&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.439.5/1">I am going to give my hon. Friend a full answer to his question. I strongly commend that he reads the OBR&#8217;s fiscal sustainability report published in July, which looks not at what will happen over the next five years but at the longer-term consequences of an ageing population. It compares what might happen under its central estimate of 140,000 net migration, which is higher than I would like to see, with what might happen if zero net migration were to occur. It finds that over a 20 or 30-year period zero net migration would mean an extra 8.2% of GDP of fiscal tightening. In other words, very significant spending cuts or tax increases would be involved if that is the road we wish to go down as a country. We need to have this debate, because there is a balance to be struck. A policy of unlimited migration has benefits for our fiscal position, but it has real consequences for our public services, the level of housing we require and development in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful contribution, which is unusual from a Conservative Member on the subject of immigration, and he is right to oppose the motion.

We heard something about repatriation earlier. Does he appreciate that they will probably have to go much further if they are to achieve these ambitions?</p>

	<p pid="a.440.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is being very unfair to my colleagues. What they have done in this debate is, rightly, set out the widespread concerns that exist across this country. I am trying to talk about what the consequences of further steps would be, as those are where my concerns lie. I represent part of this great city, with its very diverse population. All the electorate in my constituency want a reduction in net migration and in population growth, but they do not want to see the economic consequences of taking that policy too far. This is a question of striking the right balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/2">I wish to make a couple of other quick points. Some question whether there is a correlation between population growth and economic growth, but if they examine the parts of the country that have seen the most significant population growth in recent years, they will see a correlation with the areas that are performing best economically. A sort of chicken and egg situation applies, because an area that is doing well economically tends to encourage people to move there because they think they can find work there. There does seem to be a correlation at a local level within our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/3">I briefly wish to pick up on what the Prime Minister said in relation to the reshuffle. He said that every Department should be actively</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/4">&#8220;involved in the effort to get the deficit down and get the economy moving.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/5">I agree that that is the central test. The Government must deliver the manifesto commitment on net migration. Equally importantly, we must give people confidence that the system is working and that the people coming into the country are those who are doing so legally through a properly run immigration system. We must also not lose sight of the clear economic benefits that a well managed migration system can bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase> made an excellent point about the pressure on public services, but he also kindly acknowledged a good intervention&#8212;the British Medical Association has sent all Members a briefing on this&#8212;on the contribution that migrants make in delivering many of our public services. So, again, there is a balance to be struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/7">For many of the things that the public are really concerned about, other solutions are available alongside a reduction in net migration. One of the real issues we have with the pressure on land for development is the significant reduction in household size. If, across this House, we could develop policies to try to prevent the level of family breakdown, that would reduce the pressure on housing. Another issue that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> raised was the regional imbalance around the UK. Parts of this country are very heavily populated, with real density, and they are often the areas that are seeing the biggest increases in population, but that is not the case uniformly</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/8">across the UK. Half of all the population growth in the past 10 years was in London, the south-east and the east of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/9">We could make much more of a national effort on infrastructure. Personally, I would have liked to see more cuts in current spending and more investment in infrastructure on the capital side.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/10">Finally, if we are serious about this issue, we should consider not only non-EU immigration but migration from within the EU. The debate is a bit more complicated, in my opinion, than the motion makes out.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.2/2">I have never shied away from debates about immigration. In fact, I find it odd to hear from people who think that it is very brave to argue, as this motion does, for a cut in immigration, as though those of us who have argued for immigrants&#8217; rights over decades have had it easy.

They are an example, as are many of my constituents, of the positive impact of migration around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. What I object to most about the motion is its focus on numbers and its failure to focus on the lives of human beings. That is the issue. If we are thinking about migration policy, the first thing we need to do is think about who the migrants are, what they are here for and what the benefits are to them, their families, the communities they come to and the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.4/2">Frankly, there is a serious consequence of not starting from the question of the lives of human beings, and we saw it in the decision on London Metropolitan university, where there has been a collective punishment of perfectly legitimate students for the failure of the institution at</p>
	<p pid="a.441.4/3">which they registered in all good faith. I am not saying that every student was necessarily legitimate, but we know that those students who are and who fulfil all the requirements have been collectively punished, absolutely contrary to British traditions, for the failure of the institution in which they work. That is a consequence of trying to decide immigration policy not on its human consequences, but on some abstract numerical basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.4/4">Some of the attempts that the Government have made to date to reduce immigration policy have had serious consequences. I want to take the opportunity of the new Minister&#8217;s presence in this debate to highlight some of them and to ask him to consider whether things are going in the right direction. A large group of migrants in my constituency have come here as family members of people who are already in this country. Recently, the immigration rules have been changed to require that if a family is to be united in such a way they need to earn, if they have one child, for example, &#163;22,500. That is above the average wage of people who live in Slough. More than half of my constituents, if they marry someone from overseas, will be unable to be united with their spouse. That is cruel. It is unfair to have a means test on the right to a family life.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.0/1">Will the hon. Lady address this point? I represent a constituency where housing is extremely expensive and rents are high. If the person bringing in the family members cannot afford to support or house them, who is to pay for that?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.442.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="442"  time="015:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0002.htm#12090626001303">
	<p pid="a.442.1/1">Before the regulations were changed, they had an absolute requirement that someone coming in had to be able to show that there would be no recourse to public funds, and I certainly support that. I have never objected to a requirement that a family trying to be reunited in this country should not depend on a public subsidy to do so and must be able to show that they can afford to house themselves and so on. That is perfectly right, but I do not see why ordinary, hard-working, low-paid workers in my constituency should be barred from being reunited with the families, which has been the case since the rule change.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/2">A second change that I would like the Minister to address is the growing Home Office practice&#8212;one designed to look tough but not necessarily be tough&#8212;of insisting on more temporary steps before someone can become a permanent resident of this country. As a result, people are given three or five years&#8217; leave and then must apply at a later time to become a permanent resident, with additional costs for them, and then of course they must be here for longer to acquire British citizenship. I have no problem with people having to be here for a substantial amount of time before they can acquire citizenship, but what I know is that the Home Office cannot administer these applications and is grotesquely inefficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/3">I have constituents who can work perfectly legally but, because their applications for an extension of leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain have not even been logged in the Home Office computer two months after they were submitted, the Home Office is unable to tell their employers that they have the right to work. In two of the three cases in my constituency people have been suspended from their jobs, although they are here perfectly legally and have the right to work, simply because the Home Office&#8217;s immigration system is unable</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/4">to confirm that to their employers. That just seems to me to be stupid. It was introduced in order to look tough, but the consequence has been to give the Home Office more work than it is capable of doing, as a result of which it has become even more inefficient than it has been for years. I beg the Minister to look at that again.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/5">Another feature of the temporary arrangements, in my view, increases the risk of human trafficking to the UK: the changes that have been made to the domestic workers visa. Some years ago the Home Affairs Committee produced an excellent report pointing out how important that visa was as a tool for reducing the rate of people being trafficked into the UK to work in people&#8217;s homes. The visa has been abandoned, and as a result I am certain that we are seeing more human trafficking into the UK. I hope that this Minister can look again at the issue, because one of the horrific phenomena arising from being part of a more globalised society is the terrifying increase in human trafficking into and, increasingly, out of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/6">One group of migrants that the Minister cannot influence, and that the motion would not influence, is the number of people seeking asylum in this country. One of the reasons why migration levels seemed low in the late &#8217;90s was simply the fact that the Home Office made no decisions on asylum seekers; it just took in the applications. It did not always register them; indeed, about 100,000 of them are still lurking in something called the controlled archive.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/7">It is really important that the Home Office makes decisions in real time and delivers on the promises it made. I wrote to many of my constituents to tell them that their cases would be determined by July 2012, yet thousands of people across the country who were told that have still not had their cases decided.</p>

This Minister could change some of that. If we start not from numbers but from people, we might get justice in our immigration system; otherwise we will not.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.4/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to say a few words; they will therefore be a very few words. First, I congratulate</p>
	<p pid="a.443.4/2">my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> on the debate and welcome the Minister to his post.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.4/3">I say to say some Opposition Members that it is very inappropriate to use words such as &#8220;darkness&#8221; when making speeches in debates such as this, and totally inappropriate to accuse my right hon. Friend of phrasing something in a nasty way. No Government Member is talking about internment camps, torture or whatever else. No one is going down that road, and nor would we, as hon. Members know. It is disingenuous to put that accusation to my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.4/4">Let me remind the House that for too long we have been unable to have this debate. The subject finally tumbled out, after 13 long years of the Labour party in power, because the former Prime Minister forgot to turn a microphone off. When we heard what he said, we realised that to be concerned about immigration meant that we were bigots, racists and all the rest of it. The wave of anger against <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> was palpable after that, particularly on behalf of the poor lady who was humiliated in such a way. What that said to me to and to everyone else in this House was that we want this topic to be debated reasonably and fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.4/5">I believe, as do many of my constituents, that this country is full. Yes, of course Scotland has more space, but if it were suggested that we put houses all over its lovely mountains I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> would be the first to object. It is just not practical. We need only look at the housing debate that is going on right now. We are having to reconsider the planning laws to reduce the restrictions on green belt development because we need to build so many homes. We are full&#8212;that is the practicality of the situation in which we find ourselves&#8212;and we have to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.4/6">I welcome the way that the Government are going. I hope that we will have a firm and fair system so that people who come into this country have visas and references and have put money into a bank account so that we can count them in and, if necessary, count them out. That must be the sensible way forward. I commend the Government and hope that they will now put the fine words they are purporting to say into action.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.0/1">I cannot support the motion. I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, because it is very important, but I find it surprising that the House of Commons, through the motion, is inviting the Government to take any measures they want in order to reach a particularly arbitrary target. I cannot possibly support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">Today, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40525" name="Paul Blomfield">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)</phrase> said, the Business, Enterprise and Skills Committee reported on its inquiry into student visas. The central recommendation of the report is that student visas be taken out of the net migration statistics. That is consistent with the recommendations made by the Home Affairs Committee, the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, and, earlier this week, the Public Accounts Committee. The evidence in favour of doing so is overwhelming, because there is</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">currently a contradiction at the heart of Government policy. On one hand, the Government are extolling the virtues of growth and imploring UK Trade &amp; Investment to expand British exports throughout the world, and on the other, the Home Office is sending out a message that because of our migration statistics we have to curb the number of migrants to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/4">Given the fact that students represent about half the current level of migration, there is absolutely no way that the Government can achieve this particular target without curbing student migration. Indeed, it has been estimated that to reach even the Government&#8217;s figures would cost &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion a year in vital export earnings. To reach the motion&#8217;s figures would mean that the figure for student migration was nil, which would cost vastly more. The simple solution for the Government is to remove those figures from those used to measure net migration, and then we can have a debate on what the public are really concerned about, not the level of student migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/5">There was a mini-debate earlier about the Home Office&#8217;s assessment, but all the evidence shows that only a tiny proportion of those students who come here to study actually stay on as permanent migrants. The existing statistical basis of our migration figures is grossly misleading with regard to the real impact that students have on migration. I would have liked to have had time to address a whole range of other issues, but that is the central point that the Government need to embrace and I hope that the new Minister will listen to the collective wisdom of several Select Committees and act on it.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.0/1">I, like all Members who have spoken in this debate, congratulate my right hon.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40082" name="Roger Godsiff">the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr Godsiff)</phrase> that it is right that Parliament should talk about and address one of the issues that is of primary concern to a great number of our constituents. A lot of them take such issues seriously, whether they be migrants themselves, whether their families have been in this country for 1,500 years, or whether they be second or third generation migrants. I have never believed that, just because somebody is concerned about immigration, that, somehow or other, makes them racist. Of course, some such people are racist, but the vast majority are not. They are not bigots; they have a serious set of concerns that we need to address, so I congratulate my right hon. Friend and the right hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. I have to say, however, that I think that the right hon. Gentleman wanted to have his cake and eat it, if he does not mind me saying so.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is smiling. I did not mean that to be a foodist comment. He argued in favour of cuts to immigration, but then said that he wants an easier system for distinguished people to come into the country. He said that he wants to get rid of the hub and spoke system, but I would suggest that that would significantly increase the costs of running this</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/2">country&#8217;s migration system, and that he wants to give the officials far more discretion. There is real danger in going down that route. We have to have a system that is manifestly fair and robust and that delivers the same outcome, whatever personal connections somebody may have.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.2/3">As several Members have said, there are three problems with the motion. First, it links immigration policy to population, and population only. Secondly, it uses the phrase &#8220;all necessary steps&#8221;, which is a very dangerous set of words. Thirdly, there is a danger that if we agree to the motion we would effectively be cutting off our noses to spite our faces, because of the potential unintended consequences for the future with regard to our economy and our society, let alone to the specifics of our education.</p>

	<p pid="a.446.5/1">Good. I am glad that my right hon. Friend confirmed that I have eyes in my head, if not in the back of it. Usually, I can sense his presence in the Chamber, but could not on this occasion, so I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.5/2">I will make a few introductory remarks. First, it is vital that we have a robust, firm, workable and controlled immigration system that is fair to resident British nationals and to migrants who seek to come here.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.5/3">Secondly, as many hon. Members have said, sometimes perhaps slightly patronisingly, immigrants have contributed enormously to the United Kingdom. I am sure that we would all agree with that. Few of the people living in my constituency of the Rhondda were not born there. I think that the percentage is the lowest of any constituency in the country. However, 100 years ago, there would not have been the economic growth that there was in the valleys of south Wales without migration from Ireland, England, Scotland and, most notably, Italy. When there was significant unemployment in Italy, many Italians came to work in the south Wales valleys, which is why a caf&#233; is known as a brachi in south Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.5/4">Thirdly, British emigrants have contributed phenomenally around the world. One has only to go to Buenos Aires and see that it has more pipe bands than Glasgow to see the positive role that British people have played elsewhere. It would be hypocritical to adopt an attitude that we do not expect British people to face when they travel abroad as emigrants.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.2/1">The motion is about numbers. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that there is a vast difference between people moving from Europe, a largely overcrowded continent, to the emptiest countries in the world, such as Australia, Canada and large parts of south America, and the problems that we face as almost the most congested corner of Europe?</p>

	<p pid="a.447.3/1">It does not feel very congested in the Rhondda, I have to say. Sometimes this debate is conditioned strongly by the problems in the south-east of England. It is also a problem for our economy that we are far more dependent on one area&#8212;London and the south-east of England&#8212;than many countries in Europe. The more that we can to do shrink the country and extend financial opportunities around the country, the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/2">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s analysis of Latin America. The biggest and fastest-growing cities in the world are all in Latin America and many parts of it face vast congestion. I just think that he is wrong on those facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/3">The vast majority of British people value the presence in British universities of international students. We all see that as a positive for the British economy, because if people study in this country and then go back to their country, they are&#8212;we hope&#8212;more likely to have a positive experience of this country and to do business with us in the future. That is without mentioning the amount of money that having international students pumps into the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/4">In addition, the vast majority of people in this country want to protect our reputation for welcoming refugees from oppression, torture, violence and oppressive regimes around the world. Although free movement within the European Union undoubtedly has its problems&#8212;that is felt not just in the United Kingdom, but notably at the moment in Spain&#8212;it is vital to the free market on which the British economy depends.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.3/5">Linking immigration to population is not as straightforward as many hon. Members have suggested this afternoon. Those who come to this country often leave. If we changed the number of people coming into the country in some categories, we would lose the bounce effect from the people who leave after a few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.6/1">The hon. Gentleman is very kind. Speaking as the daughter of a migrant, he is free to patronise my contribution at any moment he chooses. Does he agree that a significant problem with regard to numbers, which as far as I am aware has not been raised, is that it is incredibly difficult to have an informed debate about immigration when the data collection on</p>

	<p pid="a.448.0/1">The hon. Lady makes a very fair point, which is related to the next point that I was going to make. Several hon. Members have referred to the number of students, and 60% of non-EU migrants to this country are students. My contention is that the vast majority of those students return to their country of origin. Their whole aim is to come here, study and take their skills back to their own country. The evidence is not cast-iron on any side of that argument, but let those who say that the vast majority of students stay here prove it. I simply do not believe that to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/2">I return to the number of 70 million mentioned in the motion. Several hon. Members have been profoundly misled about the figures, because if net migration were zero in every category for the next 25 years, the population would grow to 66 million by 2035, up 6% from what it was in 2010. If net migration were tens of thousands, which as a couple of Members have mentioned is the Government&#8217;s declared aim, the population would be 70 million just after 2035. I do not think the measures that are currently being taken will achieve that declared aim, so they would have to be redoubled, if not trebled, for us to achieve what the motion proposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/3">In addition, intra-company transfers under tier 2 were at 29,000 in 2010, roughly the same number in 2011 and 29,571 in 2012, but none of them entitle somebody to settlement in this country, so tackling them would not affect the final figures to which the motion refers.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/4">I also object to the phrase &#8220;all necessary steps&#8221;. Even if the Government were to achieve their declared aim, the population would reach 70 million just after 2035. I suppose that if we were taking all necessary steps, we could theoretically tear up all our asylum commitments. The number of them has fallen in recent years to 19,804, but they are long-standing commitments. Would we really want to tell people fleeing Mugabe or a vicious regime elsewhere in the world that they could not come to this country, and that we would no longer respect those commitments?</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/5">We could cut the cap on tier 2 migration below 21,700, but it is already undersubscribed. Only half the certificates of sponsorship were taken up in the last year. If we cut intra-company transfers by installing a cap, I believe that we would dramatically harm the UK&#8217;s opportunity to act as an international hub.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/6">We could encourage more people to leave the country and make them emigrate by increasing the threshold for settlement to more than &#163;35,000, but that would touch only some 3,000 people at best. We could curtail non-EU migration, but not without cutting demand. According to many employers, the danger is that they would simply seek to employ more EU migrants. The key point is that we have to deal with demand for migrant labour in the UK. For instance, we need to deal with pay and conditions in many parts of the country, so that it makes sense for British people to work. We need to ensure that people have the skills to be able to take the jobs in key industries such as construction and hospitality that are currently being taken by migrants. We also have to tackle the</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/7">vectors of mass migration around the world, particularly war, famine, poverty and climate change. On that basis, I do not think it would be right to support the motion.</p>

The rate of immigration over the past decade has led to great public anxiety about its impact on transport, jobs, employment, change within our communities and the provision of public services. We have promised to get a grip on the situation, and that is exactly what we will do.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/4">I will reiterate the comments of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and thank the Backbench Business Committee and those members of the public who signed a petition for giving me an opportunity&#8212;just 48 hours into the job&#8212;to listen to the concerns of hon. Members and set out some of the Government&#8217;s views.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/5">In just over two years following the general election we have reformed every route of entry for non-EEA migrants to the UK. We have increased the level of skill required to come to the UK for work, tackled abuse in the student sector and stopped family migrants who cannot financially support themselves coming to the country. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">The hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> referred to family links, and our policy is designed to ensure that those who bring family members to the country do not require support from the taxpayer. People should be able to bring family members into the country, but I do not see why they should expect them to be supported by the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.1/1">My point was that the previous rules required people to provide evidence that they did not need support from the taxpayer. The new rules, however, state that they need an income of more than &#163;22,400. Plenty of people in my constituency&#8212;about half my constituents&#8212;live on an income smaller than that, without recourse to the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.2/1">My understanding is that income limits are set because they are linked to qualification levels for various kinds of income-related benefits. That is why limits were introduced and I think that is perfectly sound.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/2">We have also broken the link concerning migrants who come on temporary visas and stay in the country for ever. A work or study visa no longer acts as a route to settlement, and we have made it clear that those on temporary visas are expected to return home.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/3">Many hon. Members have noted that immigration brings significant benefits to the UK&#8212;my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex made that clear in his remarks. There are cultural, social and economic benefits and, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead pointed out, sporting benefits such as those we have seen recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, with whom I duelled across the Dispatch Box in my previous post, celebrated multicultural Britain and I am therefore confused why he and his party wish to break it up. As he will know, I campaigned strongly in a previous role to keep our United Kingdom together&#8212;a wish I believe is generally shared across the House. The United Kingdom is better together, and I fervently hope that the campaign will be successful and that as Immigration Minister I will never have to deploy the UK Border Force along the England-Scotland border. The Government will do their best to keep our country together. The United Kingdom is better together, which the hon. Gentleman suggested when he celebrated it in his contribution. That belief is shared by those in the Chamber, expect perhaps by the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40044" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir)</phrase> sitting next to him. Other hon. Members will, I think, agree with my sentiment.</p>

	<p pid="a.450.0/1">It is almost impossible to break up Britain; I live in the northern part of the island of Great Britain.

Will he, unlike previous Immigration Ministers, have a proper look at the issue and please give us a break?</p>

	<p pid="a.450.1/1">I will, of course, study the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s points carefully, but the conclusion he wishes to reach is different from mine. I want to keep our country together; he wants to break it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.1/2">The public rightly expect the Government to have a robust immigration policy to prevent migrants from coming to the UK and relying on benefits, to stop abuse, and to enforce the removal of those who fail to comply with the rules. Controlling migration is an important factor in keeping the UK&#8217;s population growth at a sustainable level. The Government are clear that annual net migration to the UK of hundreds of thousands is not sustainable. With our reforms focused on the best and the brightest migrants to the UK, we anticipate and intend that net migration will fall to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.1/3">In his thoughtful and excellent speech, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase> spoke of striking the right balance between economic growth and gross domestic product per head. We believe that our commitment, which he confirmed he supports, strikes that right balance. I continue to support that commitment, as did my predecessor.</p>

	<p pid="a.451.0/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments and look forward to appearing before his Committee&#8212;I am sure the invitation will be on its way shortly if it is not already. He was not in the Chamber for all of the debate because he was hearing evidence from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, but I am grateful for his comments. His concerns about the UKBA are well known&#8212;I have heard him describe them on a number of occasions. I have already met the chief executive of UKBA and the head of the UK Border Force, on which I intend to keep a close eye. I come from a private sector background in which I was involved in managing people and have experience of working in a large, complicated organisation. I mean to get immersed in the details and keep a very close track on UKBA, as I am sure he would expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/2">Things are starting to move in the right direction. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics show that net migration is falling&#8212;from 252,000 at the end of 2010 to 216,000 at the end of 2011. Visa indicators for the first half of 2012 show that the downward trend is likely to continue. That is a small step in starting to turn the ship around, but we need patience. We have always said that our policy will take the full course of a Parliament to have effect. There is no quick solution. The system we inherited was broken&#8212;even the Labour party has accepted that there was a large number of problems in the system the Government inherited&#8212;and we need to take some time to turn it around.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/3">I should address a couple of specific points made in the debate. Several hon. Members commented on students and London Metropolitan university. It is important to say that we have taken tough action against the institution, but we have also set up a taskforce to work closely with and support the genuine students to find another institution where they can continue their studies in the UK. It is absolutely right that we support those legitimate students who are here legally, complying with the terms of the basis on which they are here. However, it is also right that we take firm action against institutions that fail to carry out the steps they are supposed to carry out if they are to be trusted sponsors. The public would expect that.</p>

	<p pid="a.451.1/1">Is there not a difference between the theory of saying that the taskforce will get students into other universities and what will actually happen? One of the great treasures of our system is that universities are so different. It is inconceivable that university B will do a similar course and allow students to pick up the pieces if they transfer to it from university A. Cannot the Minister grasp that being tough on institutions, on which the House agrees with him, is totally different from being tough on legitimate students? We know full well that the bogus students will have disappeared by now and will not be punished. The current policy will punish the innocent.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.0/1">I take the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point, but it is not our intention to punish the innocent students. That is why we have set up the taskforce. I can give him the assurance that I will look at the enforcement action we have taken against London Metropolitan university&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.452.8/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. We could not go on as we were, and that is why the steps that my hon. Friend the former Minister took were welcome. We need to continue in that light.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/2">I talked about a selective immigration policy. We want the brightest and the best to come to the UK to support economic growth, and we have consulted widely on our reforms with business and the higher education sector. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> referred to the fact that since we introduced the limit on visas, they have been undersubscribed, so we have not prevented a single highly skilled worker from coming to the UK, and we have made the investor and entrepreneur routes more attractive and accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/3">Our aim is to eliminate abuse and focus on high quality, high value sectors. There is no limit on the number of students who can enter the UK to study. Reducing net migration and tackling immigration abuse are completely compatible with continuing to attract the brightest and the best.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.8/4">Immigration can be beneficial to Britain, but the unsustainable levels we have seen have been damaging. That is why we said that we would get a grip, and we are getting a grip, on immigration. If we complete our work to control net migration properly, we will have a system that is firm but fair, and we will have reassured the public that we have proper control over who comes to and stays in our country.</p>

	<p pid="a.453.0/1">I once again welcome my hon. Friend the new Minister and wish him every success in this very difficult brief. I congratulate all colleagues who spoke in this debate. What is most important is that there has been a debate. There need to be more debates. All these views are important and need to be aired. Inevitably, we hold differing views, but from these Benches we urge the Minister to press ahead, above all, with making the process more robust and more effective, and thus more humane and understood.

	<p pid="a.454.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House recognises and supports the contribution of community hospitals to the care of patients within the National Health Service; requests the Secretary of State for Health to commission a comprehensive database of community hospitals, their ownership and current roles; and believes that the assets of community hospitals should remain for the benefit of their community while allowing them greater freedom to explore different ownership models.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/3">I warmly welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to her new role. She will know that there are more than 300 community hospitals in England. I used to work at one of the very smallest at Moretonhampstead in the heart of Dartmoor, so I know just how important community hospitals are, especially to isolated rural communities. I may have lost one, but I fortunately gained four, and I am happy to represent Brixham, South Hams, Dartmouth and Totnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/4">Community hospitals vary in size and function&#8212;some are urban, some are rural, for instance&#8212;but they share a common theme: they are deeply rooted in their communities and provide an extraordinary level of support with volunteering and charitable giving through leagues of friends. The reason for that support is clear: people value their personalised approach and want to be treated closer to home. Community hospitals score well on things such as dignity, respect and nutrition. We should be treasuring and enhancing their role because, although small is beautiful, unfortunately it can make them a tempting target for cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/5">The need for efficiencies in the health service is nothing new. I remember reading in 2009&#8212;before the general election&#8212;about the Nicholson challenge. We have known for some time that we have to make &#163;20 billion of efficiency savings over the next four years&#8212;that is 4% efficiency gains year on year&#8212;but there is a misunderstanding about what this means. It is not about doing less of the same; it is about spending what we spend more efficiently and looking at the needs of our population. Over the next 20 years, the number of over-85s in our country will double.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.2/1">In my constituency, Abingdon community hospital has played a fascinating role in supporting the wider NHS in Oxfordshire. It has assisted with the problem of bed blocking by supporting early and late-stage rehab and preventing patients from needing acute beds. I do not think that community hospitals should face cuts, given the role they can play in easing pressures on acute hospitals. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

	<p pid="a.455.1/1">I wish to make the case for reinvigorating community hospitals as hubs for delivering the right care at the right time and in the right place. Of course, the right place, where possible, will always involve helping people to be independent in their own homes, but community hospitals have a vital role, through both step-up and step-down care, in helping to maintain that independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/2">We should look at what community hospitals are capable of, because they are not just about in-patient beds: they provide a full range of diagnostics, minor injuries units, therapies&#8212;physiotherapy and occupational &#8212;and mental health care. In my constituency, people with cancer can access chemotherapy at Kingsbridge hospital, saving them a long roundtrip to Derriford hospital. Kingsbridge hospital&#8212;South Hams, I should say&#8212;supports a triangle centre helping people and their families living with cancer, while organisations such as Rowcroft hospice are looking to expand their care-at-home system through hubs in community hospitals and, at times, by utilising their beds and support. We can get so much more from community hospitals if we reinvigorate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/3">We should not think of community hospitals as backwaters; they can be centres of great innovation. The nationally recognised Torbay pilot, which provides care based in the community, started at Brixham community hospital in my constituency and is now being consider for nationwide roll-out. That is a very good model.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. She mentions the Torbay model, which is rightly a pilot and flagship for the integration of services, but does she envisage a situation in which not only are medical services integrated in one location but other emergency services can come together? The result could be enhanced training for people, such as firemen and policemen, who could qualify as paramedics and assistants to the medical services.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.3/1">Indeed I do, and there are many community hospitals that support first responders in the way my hon. Friend describes. That is an important role, and there is perhaps even an extended role in housing, where step-down housing can enable people to make the transition back to full independence. Indeed, there are many such roles.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/2">What are the current barriers to providing the right care at the right time and in the right place? I would like the Minister to deal with five points. First, the biggest challenge we need to address is the tariff and tariff reform. She will know that most acute hospitals are paid through a system known as payment by results, which creates some perverse incentives, whereby acute</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/3">hospitals want to hoover up as much activity as possible. Often, people are treated in an acute setting when they could be more appropriately cared for in a community hospital setting or at home. Can the Minister update the House on the progress we are making on reforming the tariff, by, say, working towards a &#8220;whole year of care&#8221; model or looking at other ways to remove the incentive in the system that means that people cannot be transferred into community hospitals or provided with the right care in the right place?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.456.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590" speakername="Neil Carmichael" colnum="456"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001352">
	<p pid="a.456.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and I entirely agree with her important point about the tariff and acute hospitals. I hope she agrees that it is also important to signpost patients to the right place, which, because we are talking about a caring issue, is in many cases a community hospital.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.456.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" speakername="Sarah Wollaston" colnum="456"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001353">
	<p pid="a.456.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for making that important point. Quite often patients are not aware of the full range of services available in their community hospitals. We can do far better in signposting them. It is also important that GPs understand and support those services and make referrals to the right place.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/2">The second issue I would like the Minister to address is the community hospital estate. She will be aware that many community hospitals around the country are being pushed into ownership by NHS Property Services. However, there are examples around the country of community hospitals that are owned by their communities, for example, or by a social enterprise. If those hospitals are unable to have ownership of their premises, that can hold them back if they have ambitions to expand their roles in future. Obviously we want to reassure the public that these valuable community assets remain in public ownership, as it were, but we also want to ensure more flexibility in their ownership model. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister addressed that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/3">Thirdly, there is an accountability issue. There are occasions where having multiple providers operating out of a community hospital can cause confusion. Situations can arise where, because everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible, and accountability can end up being shunted around the system. Does the Minister agree that it would make more sense to have a single body, or even individual, with overall responsibility for what happens to patients and the way in which care is organised in a community hospital?</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/4">Fourthly, I want to raise an important point that goes beyond community hospitals to the whole way in which we look at a primary care based system, namely the looming crisis in general practice numbers. For the first time we now have a vacancy rate for GPs of 12% in the south-west. On top of that, in about four or five years we will have a retirement bulge&#8212;I am afraid that I have not helped the situation&#8212;and we are also moving, quite rightly, from a three-year period for general practitioner training to a four-year period. All that coming together means that across the country, the south-west included, we will face a shortage of skilled practitioners both to deliver commissioning and to staff our community hospitals. We need their support. It would be a great shame if GPs who were enthusiastic about getting involved in commissioning and helping out in their community hospitals were unable to do so because of their clinical</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/5">commitments. Can the Minister therefore update the House on how we are going to stop the problem, which has been going on for years, of too many medical students going into training in acute hospital specialties? We need more of them to go into general practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/6">Finally, will the Minister support the Community Hospitals Association? It does a tremendous job. In 2008 it received a &#163;20,000 grant to help set up a detailed database that documented not only where community hospitals are but what they do. At this time of change I hope she agrees that it is particularly important that we keep track of what they are doing. The CHA has also highlighted innovation and helped to spread best practice, so I hope that she will give it further support.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/7">No debate about community hospitals would be complete without thanking the leagues of friends, which around the country have provided millions of pounds. They do not provide luxuries; we are talking about major building projects, equipment, funds for care, volunteers who come into the hospital&#8212;an extraordinary level of support. We could not manage without them in our community hospitals. I know that the whole House will want to join me in paying tribute to our leagues of friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/8">This is a call to arms to people listening to the debate. If you value your community hospital, let your GPs know, let your commissioners know, let HealthWatch know, let your local health and wellbeing boards know. If we want community hospitals to be treasured, as we all do in the House, we need to make that very clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.2/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> and the Backbench Business Committee for securing this important debate. We can see from the number of hon. Members across the Chamber who want to talk about this that it is a valid and timely debate. I also welcome the Minister to her new position in the Health team.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.2/2">As many hon. Members and the Minister of State will know, community hospitals play a vital role in my constituency; Guisborough hospital and East Cleveland hospital are essential to East Cleveland&#8217;s health and well-being. I was privileged to secure an Adjournment debate on the future of community hospitals in the north-east on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-20">20 June</phrase>. While it was certainly good to hear from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase>, for instance, about the good work that community hospitals do in his constituency, it was clear from other hon. Members that some community hospitals are struggling. A general consensus was apparent to me that patient choice is key to this whole matter. While patients should be able to receive care at home, that is not necessarily what patients always want, and it is not always necessarily appropriate. Community hospitals therefore have a real role in providing care to such people, as well as in the provision of out-patient services, especially in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.2/3">With the Health and Social Care Act 2012 causing reorganisation that has cost the local NHS tens of millions of pounds on Teesside alone, it is perhaps not surprising that many trusts appear keen to centralise services to larger hospitals. In my constituency, we have already seen a significant reduction during this Parliament in the services available at Guisborough hospital, with the closure of the Chaloner ward and a reduction in minor injuries provision. Similarly, constituents have told me that they have been unable to receive the services that they need at East Cleveland hospital in Brotton. This is deeply worrying, as more than 50% of my constituency is rural, and I know how constituents without a car can struggle to attend hospitals further away, such as the James Cook university hospital near Marton, Easterside and Park End in the south Middlesbrough part of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.2/4">I know that this problem is unfortunately replicated around the country. In the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust area alone, a district general hospital in Northallerton&#8212;the Friarage&#8212;and Redcar&#8217;s primary care hospital are facing problems due to the centralisation of services. With the reallocation of public health funds as well, which are used primarily for community nursing, we are seeing what I can only describe as a vice-like grip between the reduction in services in community hospitals and the reduction in funding for community nursing, especially for palliative care for elderly and vulnerable people.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.0/1">I accept that the hon. Gentleman is a champion for his constituency, but he surely accepts that this is a process that started under his Government. For example, his maternity unit closed in 2006, so it is not something new.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.458.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" speakername="Tom Blenkinsop" colnum="458"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001358">
	<p pid="a.458.1/1">I can tell that the hon. Gentleman has a good memory, because that point was raised in my debate. While many services at that hospital have been closed in recent months, the maternity services at Guisborough were centralised at James Cook and the community was consulted on that. However, I did not see any proper community consultation when services at East Cleveland hospital and Guisborough were very much reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.1/2">Also, a massive number of long-serving, skilled nurses, mainly women, have been leaving Guisborough hospital before reaching retirement age. That is very worrying. They are choosing to go to other hospitals or simply to leave their careers altogether. The trust acknowledges that this is happening, and the reasons include stress, a lack of available nurses on the wards and the low-paying contracts being offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.1/3">This seems to involve a central funding issue for the trust. The James Cook University hospital is now consulting the community on privatising wards at the hospital. So, while the trust is centralising services away from the community hospitals, it is also trying to find other funding sources to pay for the services that it has centralised. That suggests that this is a central funding issue and nothing else.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.1/4">I sincerely hope, for the sake of my constituents, that the Minister takes urgent action to address the problems faced by district, general and community hospitals. Such action should include commissioning a database of information on what they do, providing trusts with</p>
	<p pid="a.458.1/5">the funds that they need to secure the future of those hospitals, and replacing the money that they have been forced to waste on an unwanted, unnecessary, top-down NHS reorganisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.0/1">I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to her new position and thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> for securing the debate. I should also like to thank the Backbench Business Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/2">Community hospitals are really important in South East Cornwall. It is a rural constituency, and the two district general hospitals serving the area are located far away from my constituents. It takes at least an hour to travel to Derriford hospital in Plymouth, and those living at the western end of the constituency have to travel to Truro, which involves about the same travelling time. It is therefore important that patients and relatives can source many services from the two community hospitals in the constituency. One is in Liskeard; the other is St Barnabas hospital in Saltash, which is housed in a beautiful historic building.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/3">When I met the Liskeard community hospital&#8217;s friends group, I learned that it had raised and spent more than &#163;30,000 on equipment to assist the treatment of patients since the hospital was built relatively recently. I am proud of and grateful to the local community for donating so much time and effort to keep the hospital well equipped. This ultimately helps many local patients. The friends continue to work to raise money for up-to-date equipment to assist with patient comfort and diagnosis. I was fortunate enough to visit the hospital last summer and to see some of the brilliant equipment that has been provided by the league of friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/4">I visited St Barnabas hospital in Saltash before the election, with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)</phrase>, and have seen for myself the wonderful facilities that it has, including some operating theatres. They are not utilised to their full extent, however, and I should like to ask the Minister to ensure that such facilities are fully utilised, especially in rural constituencies such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.0/5">Liskeard community hospital offers a number of in-patient beds, in addition to a minor injuries unit that is open every day, an X-ray department that is open from Monday to Saturday, and a range of out-patient clinics. St. Barnabas, in addition to the facilities that I have described which could be more fully utilised, offers a small number of in-patient beds and a day-case surgery. In addition, a range of out-patient clinics is held on site, and the minor injury unit is open every day. I believe that there is capacity for expansion at both locations. That would benefit patients living in my very rural constituency, which has limited public transport. I hope that the Minister will take note of this and ensure that as many services as possible are rolled out to our valuable community hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase> on gaining her place on the Front Bench. I wish her luck in her new role.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/3">We are discussing community hospitals, which provide an important service in offering care to all our communities. I think there could be a renaissance in community hospital provision in the coming decades, not least because the vast majority of money in the national health service is spent not on all the exciting acute and surgical kit, but on the provision of care to the chronically unwell. Where better for the chronically unwell to be treated than in their communities?</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/4">I am particularly interested in this subject because I have recently published on it&#8212;and I commend my own publication to all colleagues in the Chamber! It is a 70-page document that my office and I managed to put together, and it was published in May this year. In it, I call for the closure of some acute hospitals and for the merger of community hospitals around what is commonly described as the hub-and-spoke health care model.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/5">I am told by some experienced and seasoned politicians that this is quite dangerous stuff. I have called in the press for the local maternity unit not to reopen, and I have argued that having a casualty department at my local district general hospital would not be in the best interests of my constituents. People may say, &#8220;Good luck with your single term in office, Phillip&#8221;, but the reality is&#8212;I am being serious here&#8212;that what I am saying is in all our best interests. I would say that it is in the interests of those on both sides of the House&#8212;it is a pity that so few Opposition Members are in their places today&#8212;that we get behind the reality of what is happening in the delivery of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/6">I have not met anyone working in the medical profession who does not support the principle of the consolidation of acute and surgical services and the provision of chronic care in community settings, so this is undeniable. If anyone meets such a person, please put them in touch with me, as I would be interested to hear the argument for the status quo.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/7">The reality is that acute and medical/surgical care is becoming increasingly complex, increasingly expensive to deliver and, in particular, increasingly difficult to staff. Nowadays, we do not have the &#8220;Sir Tufton Bufton&#8221; general surgeon as once there was; we have different qualified surgeons within the broad field of general surgery. If I have something wrong with my upper gastro-intestinal tract, I want to go to an upper GI specialist. I do not want to go to someone who does it occasionally; I want to go to someone who does it daily. This is clearly not possible on every district general site in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/8">We are beginning to see the realities. There is a consolidation of services ongoing in the south of London. It is politically sensitive, I gather, but it is going to happen, so everybody needs to wake up to it. It has already happened in Norwich; it is happening in Cambridge; and I gather it has happened in Swindon. That this is happening everywhere around the country is, I believe, a positive move. I do not seek to make any political point or to any political capital out of it because I know that if there were a Labour Government, it would be happening in any case. I would encourage not just existing MPs, but candidates at the next election to be more honest about this. As I say, it is really in all our</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/9">best interests. Ultimately, we are here to try to secure a health service that provides the very best for all our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/10">Let me move on to my specific regional case. To provide some background, I still work as a doctor, and I intend to continue working as one&#8212;not least because one morning in Slough is enough reality to keep my feet on the ground. In that capacity, I have formed the impression that what we need on the ground in Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and south-east Oxfordshire is a consolidation of acute and surgical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/11">Having looked after approximately 50,000 patients in about 50 general practices throughout the Thames valley, referred patients to every acute centre and worked with every hospital except the Royal Berkshire, I feel that I may have something to say about this issue. I have concluded that we need a new hospital at junction 8/9 of the M4, and I am not alone in thinking that. Deloitte, which was paid significantly more money than I was to produce its wonderful report in 1989, reached exactly the same conclusion, and that was before Wycombe general hospital had been downgraded as a fully fledged acute surgical site.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/12">I am in favour of the retention of all community hospitals in the region except two. One is Heatherwood, the hospital that has traditionally served my constituency&#8212; people may say that I just talk the talk, but in this instance I am walking the walk&#8212;and the other is St Mark&#8217;s in Maidenhead. I want to enhance the delivery of chronic medical services on the Brants Bridge site in Bracknell. That is the plan, and I am trying to build some grass-roots support for it. I am trying to emphasise&#8212;this brings me back to the topic of the debate&#8212;the importance of community hospitals, the importance of the services that they offer now, and the fact that they can offer enhanced services in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/13">Given an ageing and increasingly retired population and a diminishing economic position, we shall have to sell off sites to find the necessary capital funds. However, this is a positive story. We can have new acute emergency hospitals throughout the country, although I recognise that in rural areas they will have to be supported by helicopters and the like. We can provide better services, both in the community and in the central, specialised hospitals, delivering the very best health care in the 21st century. That is why I am a proud supporter of community hospitals. I hope that all Members of Parliament of all parties will step up to the plate and be honest about the situation, so that care for all patients can be improved in future.</p>

I think that we have all appreciated her analytical contributions to debates on health and on other matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/2">I have only one simple point to make, which is better than my normal average. The fact is that community hospitals are in a slightly ambiguous category. Some are innovative, valued, highly rated and essential, while others are historical legacies of a previous age&#8212;expensive</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/3">to run, limited in range, and out on a limb. Some areas depend on them, and some areas, such as mine, have absolutely none. I was a founder member of the all-party parliamentary group on small hospitals simply because my constituency contained a small acute general hospital. Dr Taylor was, of course, elected over an issue involving the closure of hospitals, which has been a shock to the whole political system ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/4">What a community hospital offers, what it consists of, how it is staffed and the services that it offers varies from one community to another, but what is universally the case is that, negatively or positively, we are now deciding what we will do about such hospitals and evaluating their place in the new system. There are three forces working against them. First, there are the perceived and evidenced benefits of specialisation&#8212;mentioned by the hon. Member for Bracknell&#8212;and the concentration of hospital services across many surgical and medical fields, leading to bigger and more expensively resourced general hospitals. Secondly, there is the encouragement given to GPs to provide more and more services in a primary care setting: tests, dermatology and the like. Thirdly, there is the encouragement given to non-NHS providers to offer clinical services at NHS prices. Given the additional fact that the last Government cut the umbilical cord which, in many instances, joined community hospitals to PCTs and effectively guaranteed their funding, the problem is clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/5">The result of all that is that each community hospital has had to establish its own niche within an increasingly tightly regulated and exacting health economy. The range of services they provide varies: recuperative services, palliative services, minor injuries services, clinical and diagnostic services, blood tests, and&#8212;very importantly&#8212;the provision of satellite services for bigger players. It can look as if they are searching for a role, but their absence, closure or downgrading has the capacity to seriously unnerve communities and their MPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/6">Hard-headed health economists and medics regard this as emotional populism; they see people getting upset about the survival of their community hospital as, in effect, a costly attachment to buildings. However, they misunderstand the public&#8212;and, to some extent, the rural&#8212;psyche. People have reasonable and rational expectations concerning the clinical quality of services, and the NHS tries to state them, define them and meet them. People also have reasonable, but generally unstated, expectations about access to services, and the NHS often dodges them, declines to state them, or shuffles off responsibility to the Department for Transport. People will travel to the ends of the earth for life-saving specialist care, but they see no reason in the modern age to travel 10 miles for a simple blood test or the triaging of bumps and falls.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/7">We have to accept that acute care will increasingly take place only in ever-larger city hospitals, but there will be hassle for everybody, including relatives, if prolonged recuperation or chronic diseases are treated in the same place. It is true that over time GPs will do more and send fewer patients to hospital, but no GP will ever provide 24/7 open access. Very few GPs are now on call, and they do not offer the full raft of community hospital services.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/8">If community hospitals are to have a long-term future, we have to be clear about access, access standards, what the reasonable standards of access are and what each</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/9">citizen can reasonably expect from the NHS&#8212;a subject on which I had an Adjournment debate a few months ago. If that is not done, the future of community hospitals will be left to market forces to play out, which is not a game I see community hospitals winning.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing this debate. We are discussing an important topic and there are many wide-ranging issues to be addressed. I also congratulate the Minister on having been appointed to her new role. We all look forward to working with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/2">Community hospitals do not just provide excellent clinical medical care. They are also places where patients feel the warmth of the community, which adds to a sense of well-being that is also part of their recovery. One reason why people feel so strongly about having community hospitals close and accessible is because it means friends and relatives can attend, which helps to make patients feel well. That is not just emotional clap-trap.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes put her finger on a key point when she said that this is about the community and trying to extend and expand the range of community services that are available. My community hospitals in Teignbridge are going from strength to strength, and there is a move towards integrating social and health care. That will be the salvation of community hospitals in the future. I support my hon. Friend&#8217;s comments about volunteers, too. The league of friends and the community transport in my three hospitals are first class. Without them, our community hospitals would not be nearly as successful and happy.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/4">My three hospitals are quite different, but they all have minor injuries units and X-ray facilities, and provide a variety of services to the old and the young. Dawlish was the first private finance initiative hospital ever built, and patient surveys consistently put it in the top three of the 22 Devon hospitals. Remarkably, Teignmouth still has an operating theatre, as well as a physio unit funded by the league of friends&#8212;well done! Newton Abbot got the 2007 PFI deal of the year. Unusually, it has a maternity unit, as well as a first-class stroke unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes also raised the important issue of ownership. I raised this matter last year in a Westminster Hall debate. It is crucial that we get clarity about how ownership is to be managed once the asset is transferred from the primary care trust. In the case of Teignmouth hospital, the property is owned outright by the PCT. As I understand it, that property will be transferred to NHS Property Services Ltd. My local community has put in &#163;850,000, so how does it feel about that? What will happen on future fundraising? Will the money just go into a central pot? What terms and conditions will be imposed on the service provider?</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/6">The situations at Newton Abbot and Dawlish are much more complicated, because those hospitals are the subjects of PFI contracts. That means that the buildings are owned by a private contractor and are, in effect, rented out to the service provider subject to two</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/7">charges, an availability fee and a service charge, both of which have historically been extraordinarily high. In those cases, the contracts will be transferred to the NHS Commissioning Board. That raises a number of legal questions about the validity of the transfer, given the nature of that contract, and about the ability of the new owner to renegotiate the contract. Why do I talk about renegotiation? I do so because it is well known from evidence in the press that some of the charges that have been levied are disproportionately high. What can we do to enable such a renegotiation? Clearly it will be completely inappropriate for a local trust provider to undertake such a renegotiation, so will the NHS Commissioning Board do it?</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> has been brilliant in raising a campaign to look at renegotiating these contracts. The Government have already started to look at the whole management issue of these contracts to see whether costs can be cut, and they reckon that a substantial saving has been made and 5% savings can be achieved. They have established a fund of more than &#163;1.5 billion for this; that is the amount that any one trust can get over 25 years to assist with the blighting cost, but that can be obtained only in exceptional and historic circumstances. The fund has been used, but generally that has been in much larger cases involving much bigger hospitals; I cannot see a community hospital being able to pass the test of having exceptional and historic problems. So what can the Government do to help those hospitals blighted with the burden of a PFI contract? I have heard of hospitals that, under the service charge, have had to pay &#163;333 just to change a light bulb. I am pleased to say that that was not the case in my local hospital, but my goodness me that sort of situation has to change.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.0/1">My hon. Friend rightly raises the issue of PFI and asks what the Government can do. I would venture to suggest that the previous Health Secretary&#8217;s decision to approve the county council&#8217;s assistance to the health trust so that it could buy out the PFI contract that was crippling Hexham hospital is exactly the right way forward. Under that approach, a PFI arrangement is bought out and a much better financial basis is put in place&#8212;an ongoing future financial basis approved by all.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.464.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40426" speakername="Anne-Marie Morris" colnum="464"  time="016:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001364">
	<p pid="a.464.1/1">My hon. Friend makes absolutely the right point, but the tragedy is that few communities can afford that sort of buy-out. As he rightly says, if we could achieve that, it would undoubtedly be the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/2">All we need from the Minister is some clarity as to exactly how these properties are to be transferred; what the position with the local community will be when properties are owned by NHS Property Services Ltd; and what the position will be on the PFI contracts when they get passed across to the NHS Commissioning Board. Clarification on those matters would be helpful and it is now urgently needed, because local trusts that are looking at continuing to run these hospitals need certainty about what they are going to be including in their budgets, and the sorts of figures that the availability fee and the service charge take out are phenomenal. The availability fees at my local hospitals range from 18 to 35%; that is the fee simply to repay the funding costs of</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/3">the overall PFI arrangement. The service charge can also be high, reaching 18 to 20%. Set against that, private investors are currently seeing returns of up to 50%. That is huge and it seems unreasonable. The previous Government entered into a voluntary arrangement whereby any excess profits, particularly as a result of contracts being bundled by external private bodies, should be shared between the taxpayer and the private investor.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/4">All those tools, which are available for the Government, need to be used. We need certainty and manageable budgets so that our community hospitals can thrive and so that money is available for what we really need&#8212;the services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.465.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40143" speakername="Aidan Burley" colnum="465"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001365">
	<p pid="a.465.0/1">I, too, thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> for securing this very important debate, which, as she will see from my speech, is very timely given what is happening in my constituency. I also congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>, on her elevation to the Front Bench. It is always fantastic to see someone from the midlands in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/2">I want to pick up on points that were made in the last two speeches. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40426" name="Anne-Marie Morris">the Member for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris)</phrase> spoke about the ownership of the hospital and the future and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> said that market forces determined the future of some hospitals. That was apt given what is happening in Cannock, where we have a situation with our community hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/3">Cannock community hospital was built in the 1980s. It is a fantastic facility with many years of life left in it, but over the past 20 years it has seen a gradual decline in use and is now chronically underused. It has gone from having nine wards when it was opened to having only two, and just last week the kitchens were closed to save &#163;200,000-odd a year. Cannock forms part of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and shares it with Stafford hospital, and many colleagues will be aware of the problems there and the extra funding the Government have had to put in. The trust that controls Cannock and Stafford hospitals has a problem, as it is losing &#163;15 million a year and &#163;8 million of that through running Cannock community hospital. That cannot go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/4">There are only three options for Cannock. First, it could be sold off and the remaining services could be transferred to Stafford hospital, which is a bigger acute hospital, with some of the receipts from the sale being used to expand services at Stafford and to accommodate them. That is unacceptable to my constituents, local people and local politicians on both sides of the divide. We are not willing to see our local hospital close&#8212;a hospital that was bought with local money from the National Coal Board and with local donations. There are therefore only two other options to secure the future of Cannock hospital, given that it is such a loss-making enterprise; it costs some &#163;34 million a year to run and pulls in about &#163;24 million from the commissioning of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/5">The first of those options is for the GPs to fill the hospital. I am sceptical about that because they have not filled it so far and it takes a brave man to persuade</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/6">the clinical commissioning groups that they must fill the hospital so that it becomes a going concern that does not lose any money and is fully utilised. GPs simply have not done that in the past. If we cannot fill it with services, I have come to the conclusion&#8212;I have just come from giving interviews to the local media on this point&#8212;that the only solution to secure the future of our community hospital is for the district council to purchase the facility or purchase a controlling part of the hospital estate. A clause in the contract would mean that the council could use the part of the estate it owned only to meet health and social care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/7">I think the future for our hospital will be for Cannock Chase district council to buy 50% or 60% of the estate&#8212;or even all of it&#8212;and decant some of the health and social care services that it runs into it, including GPs&#8217; surgeries, walk-in clinics, polyclinics, advice centres and so on. The hospital would once again be a going concern. It was valued just four months ago at &#163;34 million, so Members can see that even buying 50% of it would cost the council &#163;16 million to &#163;17 million. As a council with a turnover of several million pounds a year that can borrow &#163;80 million a year, that is feasible. I hope today to set up a working group of local hospital bosses, council leaders and officers, the friends of Cannock hospital and any local stakeholder who wants to be involved. I do not know what the answer is or how feasible this might be, but I see no other way of securing our hospital&#8217;s future and getting it utilised again unless the district council steps in, buys part of the estate and utilises it itself, or even buys the whole estate and leases part of it back to the trust, which currently uses part of it for rheumatology, orthopaedics and eye surgery but not all of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/8">I will conclude briefly by asking the Minister whether she and her Department would approve, in principle, of district councils helping to secure the future of our beloved community hospitals in that way. If so, perhaps she would consider sending an official from the Department to serve on the steering committee we are setting up to investigate the possibility so that they can guide us on how best to secure the future of our community hospital and retain its use for health and social care services, as the current reality is that it is losing money and financially is not a going concern in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing the debate and speaking about community hospitals with such passion and experience. May I also congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>, and say how pleased I am that the debate is taking place within a few days of her promotion, which means that she can hear from the Front Bench what a tremendous asset community hospitals are to all our communities? It is disappointing that only the shadow Minister and the Opposition Whip, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>, are on the Opposition Benches for this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">Our experience in West Worcestershire can certainly contribute to a debate on the ownership of community hospitals, because we have three in the constituency: Malvern, Pershore and Tenbury Wells. They all have slightly different models of ownership, and I think that</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">diversity of ownership model is something that has led to their success and will lead to their longevity. I thought that it might be worth sharing with colleagues the different approaches that have been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">I will take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor, now Lord Spicer, who fought for a new community hospital for Malvern for most of the 36 years he represented West Worcestershire. We used to have a hospital in a beautiful old building dating from the late 19th century, but it had become too small and too old and, although beautiful, was no longer fit for purpose&#8212;to use the famous NHS phrase. Everyone in the community, including the league of friends, accepted that was the case and campaigned for many years for a new build hospital. A site was secured in the 1970s but sat empty and derelict for the better part of three decades until the day when my predecessor got the phone call from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40254" name="Ben Bradshaw">the right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw)</phrase> to tell him that a new community hospital would be built in Malvern. It was a great day of celebration after so many decades of campaigning. Indeed, if any Members are in Malvern in the near future, they will see what a spectacular hospital has been built for the community. It opened just over a year ago. It is owned entirely by the Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, which of course is taking the opportunity to sell the old hospital building to help pay for the substantial cost of the new one&#8212;about &#163;17 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">We have another new hospital in West Worcestershire in the town of Pershore. Again, the town had a very old building, although not quite as old as the one in Malvern. Wychavon district council took the unique and unusual decision to create a new build hospital in the centre of town. It used its reserves to do that, and it was able to rent the building out to the local NHS trust. It is paid a much better rate of return on its cash than it would have received if it had left it in the bank&#8212;certainly an Icelandic bank, as in the case of some other Worcestershire district councils. This has proved to be a good investment for the district council and a good asset for the community. Both new builds are greatly valued by South Worcestershire clinical commissioning group, which is beginning to review the full range of hospitals, including acute hospitals, in Worcestershire. I am hearing very positive things about finding additional uses for the community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">Let me finally mention Tenbury community hospital, which has an incredibly successful and active league of friends. The town has only about 2,500 residents, but over the years the league has raised millions of pounds, not only for equipment for the hospital but for its fabric. We have seen two new wards open in the past 12 months. Tenbury hospital therefore almost has a shared ownership not only with the NHS but with the league of friends. Because the league&#8217;s investment has been so substantial, it would be unthinkable for the NHS to treat the building as an asset that it could sell on. All three hospitals are well used and increasing the range of services that they can provide in the local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">I may have saved the Department some time in relation to the motion by delivering a comprehensive database of the community hospitals in West Worcestershire. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to put on record the community&#8217;s appreciation of the services and buildings that we enjoy in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on bringing the subject before the Backbench Business Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/2">I welcome the Minister to her seat. I would be grateful if she could nod if she has received a large brown envelope marked &#8220;Urgent&#8221; which I sent to her office in the House of Commons only two days ago. Perhaps she has not quite got it yet because she has had her feet under the desk for only a couple of days; however, it is sitting there somewhere. I mention it because it contains a report whose author is sitting in the Gallery, as is Jan Turnbull, who is chairman of the Swanage league of friends, and Dr Tim Morris, a former Swanage GP.I think they would like to be assured that I have done my job in getting that excellent report to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/3">I suspect that a lot of people have been down to Swanage; it is a beautiful place. I challenge anyone, whether they are healthy or ill, to go into Swanage hospital and not automatically to feel better. They will be in a cosy home where Claire Thompson, the cook, produces cakes to die for; I have been greatly honoured to have one given to me. That wonderful cosy atmosphere not only facilitates a good service but sends people home feeling better, which is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/4">I ask, plead with, beg the Minister to carry out an audit of the 320 community hospitals in the UK before any are closed. I believe that the Government wish to increase care in the community. I always get slightly nervous when I hear that expression because that approach was tried once before by an eminent Prime Minister and I am not quite sure that it went entirely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/5">In our neck of the woods, the proposal is to close Swanage hospital and instead to send community nurses out into residential care homes where mainly elderly people&#8212;former in-patients&#8212;would be put. I would like to give the House the image of these nurses&#8212;albeit well-intentioned, well-trained and all the rest of it&#8212;arriving at a certain time of day in their vans, unloading all the medical clutter, crashing into someone&#8217;s room and saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t panic, Mrs Jones&#8212;care is here&#8221;, when instead Mrs Jones could be tucked up in bed in Swanage hospital, which has been there since 1890, being looked after 24 hours a day. Surely that is the better option, and I suggest that in the long run the other option would turn out to be far more expensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/6">Swanage hospital provides outpatient clinics, 15 inpatient beds and a 24-hour minor injuries unit, and it is particularly noted for post-acute care for stroke victims before they go home. Twenty-one consultants visit the hospital weekly, some performing minor and intermediate surgery in its operating theatre, and one GP attends daily. This is not an underused facility. The hospital staff, the league of friends and consultants want the service expanded, not closed; yet the clinical commissioning group, bless it, or CCG, which sounds rather sinister&#8212;I do not like these acronyms&#8212;wants to close it and introduce a polyclinic in its place. I had wondered whether this was to be a home for parrots or carrots, but it is for people&#8212;a polyclinic is, believe it or not, for people. I am sure that the proposal is well-meaning, that it will be well-funded and built with a lot of plastic, and that patients will go there. Yes, it is true that it will provide minor day surgery and slightly more extended services than those</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/7">that GPs can offer at present, but it will not have in-patient beds or general anaesthetic, which are what the consultants want Swanage to retain.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/8">Some miles down the road in Wareham, one of the options being suggested is to build a new hospital at a cost of, I guess, &#163;24 million to &#163;35 million, &#163;36 million or &#163;37 million. Why? Where is this money coming from? The league of friends has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds and invested it in its hospital. It now has &#163;1.4 million sitting in a bank account waiting to be invested.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/9">Sadly, the impetus behind this particular move is those GPs in Swanage who want to move to new premises. To be fair&#8212;they are not here to speak for themselves&#8212;their building is probably not fit for purpose. However, there is room next door to Swanage hospital, in a lovely, cosy place, for them to put their new clinic&#8212;it is in the town and ready to go. Instead, they want to put a polyclinic on the outskirts of town, which would be less accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/10">The situation is a tragedy. Again, I ask, plead with, demand that the Minister hold an audit of the 320 hospitals before any are closed, so that the Government can carry on doing what they are doing. In many ways, we all sympathise: money is tight, the cost of the NHS is rising inexorably and we cannot go on like this. We have to consider a more efficient way of providing a service for our patients, but closing a much-loved and much-used cottage hospital in Swanage is not the way forward. I urge the Minister to see this beautiful place, and I invite her to do so, and to meet Claire Thompson. Jan Turnbull is in the Public Gallery and we can guarantee the Minister a cake when she visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/11">Before I close, I want to raise one last point that worries me, namely that there is evidence of referrals being suppressed. I have heard this in other debates and meetings that I have had about cottage hospitals. It is said that the aim of the NHS is to claim that such hospitals are underused, but that is entirely disingenuous and, if true, absolutely and categorically wrong. Again&#8212;I make no excuse for this&#8212;on behalf of my constituents, the hospital, the league of friends and the matron, Jane Williams, I plead with, beg, ask and demand that the Minister please, please, please hold an audit before anything else is done.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.0/1">I feel shy speaking in front of this extremely distinguished audience. It is impressive to take part in a debate involving people with so much expertise. I was impressed by the extraordinary confidence with which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40107" name="Phillip Lee">the Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee)</phrase> said things that we would not dare say to any of our constituents by calling for the closure, no less, of one of the community hospitals in Bracknell on the grounds of efficiency. The sense that expertise can deliver controversial and exciting policies is moving. It is also moving for me to be able to thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> for securing the debate, and to congratulate the Minister on her new position.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/2">The debate on community hospitals should be held in a larger debate, and it is a debate that Conservatives should be proud to have: the ancient debate of the big against the small. The reason community hospitals are</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/3">under threat, have been under threat and always will be under threat&#8212;I mean this not in a political sense, but simply ideologically&#8212;is the problem of the small.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/4">In 2005, one in four members of the population in Cumbria signed a petition to keep our community hospitals open. Today, we face serious issues of the internal market and the tariff structure of the NHS, which may make it tempting for commissioners not to refer patients to community hospitals. All of that is about big and small. It is the same argument as that between the big supermarket and the small shop and between the small dairy farm and the big dairy farm.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/5">This argument goes all the way back to the foundation of the NHS. One remembers Bevan&#8217;s great statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/6">&#8220;I would rather be kept alive in the efficient if cold altruism of a large hospital than expire in a gush of warm sympathy in a small one.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1946-04-30.44"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 April 1946; Vol. 422, c. 44</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/7">In that moment, Bevan, in founding the NHS, set up the fundamental challenge. My hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell expressed the problem clearly in explaining that in the choice between acute surgical care and local care of chronic conditions, we have the choice between fancy machines, specialisation and surgeons who perform the same operation again and again, and what is required for a new situation and a new population. We are no longer in the late 1940s.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/8">If I may be so presumptuous in this distinguished company, I will put Cumbria forward as an example. We are an interesting example, because we are ahead of the rest of the country in one thing: Cumbria has more deaths than births, but a rising population. That is not, as one might imagine, because we have discovered resurrection; it is because we have old people moving to our constituency. The population of the constituency is getting older at a national record rate. We are about to go from one in six of the population being over 65 to one in three of the population being over 65. The number of people who are over 85 is about to double. The number of people with Alzheimer&#8217;s in my constituency is about to double. All that points, above all, to one thing&#8212;community hospitals. What people at that age need is not necessarily the technical services and equipment that are provided by acute hospitals, nor the specialties of their surgeons, but preventive care. That can be delivered through the hubs of which we have all spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/9">To give a local example, my neighbour recently broke her hip. To many of us in this Chamber, that seems fundamentally to be a problem of cost. It costs &#163;350 to move her in an ambulance from her home to the hospital, it costs a minimum of &#163;2,000 to admit her to the hospital, and it costs tens of thousands of pounds in ongoing costs as she struggles to get better and gets into other chronic conditions. But why did she fall? She fell because her husband died. The chance of somebody dying doubles in the year following the death of their husband. She was in trouble because she could not get anybody to take her to an optician. She was not eating properly, because nobody was able to take her to the supermarket regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/10">Those are things that the extraordinary network of local charities and community activity is in a fantastic position to provide, guided by the community hospital. In Cumbria, Cruse Bereavement Care provides counselling to people who are bereaved and Eden Carers could perhaps have taken my neighbour to the optician. Every Member has such organisations in their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/11">They have their equivalents of Hospice at Home and the Eden Valley hospice. There are also the first responders and other members of the emergency services. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> champions the air ambulance and others of us champion mountain rescue. It goes all the way down to Age UK and the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society. Indeed, we have made fantastic progress in neuroscience support at a community hospital level.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/12">I conclude with a plea to the Minister. This is not just about good language. It is easy to talk about prevention, but also very easy to carry out bad prevention and waste an enormous amount of money tacking down carpets in the houses of people who do not need their carpets tacked down. My constituency includes surprised people who have suddenly found themselves given a new shower that they did not particularly feel they needed. What we need is the local knowledge, care and compassion that can target those resources. The Minister is now in a position to move just 2% or 3% of the budget towards community hospitals and community care and away from acute trusts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.471.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40291" speakername="James Morris" colnum="471"  time="016:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001369">
	<p pid="a.471.0/1">I join in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing the debate and the Minister on her much deserved elevation to the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">Shortly before I was elected, I was contacted by some nurses from Rowley Regis community hospital in my constituency who had just been told that the hospital&#8217;s in-patient wards would be closing. Rowley hospital was one of the last community hospitals to be built under the last Conservative Government using central funds rather than through a private finance initiative project. It had always offered a mix of in-patient and out-patient care, and with about 100 beds it was considerably smaller than nearby hospitals such as Dudley&#8217;s Russells Hall, West Bromwich&#8217;s Sandwell general or Birmingham&#8217;s City hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/3">The last Government&#8217;s preference for large super-hospitals meant that the local NHS trust, like others around the country, felt under pressure to move in-patient services from small community hospitals such as Rowley. Staff at the hospital and members of the local community feared that the closure of the hospital&#8217;s two remaining wards was part of an agenda to turn it into a polyclinic, which the Government were pushing heavily. There is no question but that without in-patient care, Rowley would be more like a walk-in centre and clinic than what most people think of as being a hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/4">The campaign to keep in-patient care at Rowley brought the whole community together. Working with local residents, staff and patient groups, we gathered petitions against the loss of in-patient care, manned town centre stalls, delivered leaflets and wrote letters. The independent Facebook group alone attracted well over 1,000 supporters. Local people wanted to keep services at their local community hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/5">I know that, as other Members have mentioned, Members of all parties will have run similar campaigns in their constituencies. The campaign was a great success. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, who was then the shadow Health Secretary, joined me for meetings</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/6">at the hospital with the NHS trust and hospital staff. He promised that under a Conservative Government services would be maintained where the local population, as service users, and local GPs as commissioners, demanded them. I was therefore proud when, last year, the trust invited me to open the Henderson reablement unit, a new in-patient ward that cares for patients recovering from serious illness. The Henderson unit is now a busy and successful part of the hospital, and I know that the trust is exploring ways to bring further in-patient services to Rowley hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/7">Community hospitals such as Rowley are an essential part of the national health service. They are important because the NHS is not just about drugs and operations, it is about care and about helping people make a full recovery in a supportive environment. Rowley Regis hospital cares for patients who are recovering from life-changing illnesses and injuries while they are unable to care for themselves. The care goes beyond medical treatment and physical therapy, helping patients to regain the ability and confidence to carry out necessary everyday tasks in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/8">The staff at the hospital are fantastic examples of the very best of our national health service, showcasing the blend of professionalism and compassion on which the NHS at its best relies. Patients feel that they are given more individual and personalised care than would be possible at a large district general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/9">The hospital itself is a pleasant place to be, which is particularly important for elderly patients whose lives, after a lifetime of independence and living at home, have been turned upside down by a serious fall&#8212;such as the one mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase>&#8212;or a stroke. Patients can enjoy the beautiful gardens, and socialise in the well-designed communal areas, and when I talk to in-patients at Rowley I find that they are overwhelmingly positive about their environment and the care they are receiving. Being at the heart of the local community, rather than in a larger town a long bus journey away, helps to soften the anxiety of being away from families and friends, and it is easier for families to visit and help relatives through their recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/10">People are extremely proud of Rowley Regis hospital, and I would be pleased to welcome the Minister to Rowley so that she can see it for herself. I know, however, that Rowley is not unique, and other hon. Members have mentioned their experiences of local community hospitals. Community hospitals around the country are important to the patients they care for and treat&#8212;the kind of care that is extremely difficult to replicate in a larger hospital. I hope the new Minister will ensure that community hospitals remain a key part of a national health service that, at its heart, recognises that one size really does not fit all.</p>

	<p pid="a.472.0/1">At this moment, Mr Speaker, you must be feeling like Shakespeare&#8217;s Henry V at Agincourt, and I suggest you will look back on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-06">6 September 2012</phrase> as the day when hon. Members in the Chamber heard many potential Ministers speak for the first time. We had the great honour and privilege of hearing my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase>. She is a doctor and spoke with great</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/2">wisdom when she introduced the debate. The other doctor in the House, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40107" name="Phillip Lee">the Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee)</phrase>, also made a fine contribution. We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40288" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, who is now on the Whips Bench but previously distinguished the Department of Health, and throughout the past hour and a half a plethora of Labour Members have indulged us with their oratory and commitment to community hospitals. Finally, I welcome the new Minister who, as you prophesied, Mr Speaker, has a glittering career in front of her. Those were fine words, although I believe that you also admonished her most robustly for being a little too chatty when she was a Parliamentary Private Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/3">I strongly look forward to hearing the gentle, reticent, shy, self-effacing style that the Minister has characteristically formed throughout the past two and a half years as an MP. Some have described her as Nottinghamshire&#8217;s modern Boadicea of Broxtowe, which may stick in the future. If she is able to survive the cake-fests of south Dorset, and future requests to visit many a hospital, she will surely go far.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/4">I must make a brief declaration because I would not be in this House were it not for my campaigning as a lawyer on behalf of community hospitals, and the fact that my grandmother was an NHS matron. Furthermore, over the past two and a half years, I have probably spent more time in hospital than any other Member of Parliament, conducting an in-depth study of all aspects of NHS treatment. Due to the fact that I was not a very good jockey, I have conducted an in-depth study of orthopaedic skills because I repeatedly seemed to come a cropper at the second last at Stratford, and various other delightful destinations. I am also fundraiser for various charitable organisations in my constituency&#8212;the Great North Air Ambulance service and the National Brain Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/5">The subject of the debate is community hospitals. Amid the requests for preservation, strengthening and support, I want to enlighten the House with some success stories. The Haltwhistle hospital in Northumberland&#8212;a small community hospital in the heart of the town&#8212;is being completely rebuilt. There have been efforts to rebuild it for many years, and that is now happening on the same site in exactly the right way. That is what all hon. Members would like for their community hospitals. People in Northumberland would suggest that its integrated care is the way forward. There are standard community beds and care beds, and even one room for the larger patient, which is known in the trade as a bariatric room. That is a proper, integrated, long-term local solution in the community, for the community and involving the community. That must be the way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.0/1">Ilkeston community hospital in my community is held in great affection. Recently, one ward closed&#8212;the decision divided opinion among local GPs. We need to examine what services are provided and remind local residents and patients what facilities are available and what procedures they can obtain locally.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.473.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" speakername="Guy Opperman" colnum="473"  time="017:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090626001372">
	<p pid="a.473.1/1">I endorse entirely what my hon. Friend says and am sure the Minister has taken due note of her comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/2">I want to sell and extol the groundbreaking decision in Northumberland in favour of the PFI buy-out of Hexham general hospital. The hospital was built and opened under the former Prime Minister&#8212;the right hon. Member for Sedgefield as was&#8212;with a substantial PFI that patently impeded its ability to function, but it is among the first in the country to have been bought out by the local community. The way forward must be to try to refinance and improve the financial situation of such hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/3">Northumberland has a rebuilt community hospital and a general hospital at Hexham, which delivers all the services, including cancer care and maternity, that we would like in local facilities. That should continue, but the problem I want to raise with the Minister is the future of rural health care&#8212;the problem will also apply to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> and any number of representatives of truly rural communities. Community hospitals are clearly at the heart of that, but the way in which community hospitals integrate in rural health care is one of the significant challenges for the Department of Health in the next five, 10, 15 and 20 years. I suggest that the way ahead must be for rural health care to become more automated&#8212;we should provide computer facilities for prescriptions and check-ups&#8212;but we must also integrate facilities using examples such as the Torbay and Haltwhistle models. We should also attempt to provide paramedic and GP services in an integrated way. It is good that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>, the shadow Minister, is in the Chamber, because that will take co-operation between the unions and between local facilities. Any problems should be overcome if we make the point that people in the community are helping one another.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/4">The future of integrated services&#8212;health care, fire, police or ambulance services&#8212;must be addressed by whoever is in government. I strongly urge the Minister to come to Northumberland to see the flagship model of the health service and the great job that my trust is doing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.474.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40432" speakername="Robert Walter" colnum="474"  time="017:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090631000127">
	<p pid="a.474.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing this debate. I also congratulate the Minister on her appointment, and all of us who are committed to the future of community hospitals look forward to her comments in a few moments. This is not a party-political debate&#8212;I hope&#8212;but the complete absence of Labour Back Benchers probably explains the difficulties that we had in promoting the case of community hospitals during the 13 years of a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/2">In an age when large organisations seem to be swallowing up smaller ones, it is refreshing to find that in my county of Dorset we have 11 small hospitals, what we used to call cottage hospitals but now refer to as community hospitals. The term was coined in reaction to the hospital plan of 1962, which pressed for resources to be concentrated into hospitals of 300 beds or more, an inevitable consequence of which was the closure of smaller ones. Opposition to this came from the newly formed Association of General Practitioner Hospitals, now the Community Hospitals Association. It was the association&#8217;s chairman at the time, Sandy Cavenagh, who revealed that more</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/3">than half the patients treated in general hospital beds could be cared for equally well or better&#8212;and at lower cost&#8212;in a small hospital near their homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/4">Community hospitals survived, especially in my area, the south-west, which has 80 of the 300 or so remaining such hospitals. Dorset&#8217;s 11 community hospitals compares favourably with larger and richer counties. Two of the jewels of this array of community hospitals are in my constituency in Shaftesbury and Blandford, and with the greatest respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase>, a little bit of history is important here.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/5">In Shaftesbury there was no formal provision for the sick of the town until 1874. There had been an infirmary in the abbey, but that disappeared along with the abbey itself during the dissolution in 1539. After that there was nothing until the building of the workhouse in 1840, and its sick ward was only for the inmates. So when the Marquis of Westminster&#8217;s widow and daughter wanted to honour his memory, a cottage hospital for those in and around Shaftesbury seemed appropriate. The marquis had owned large estates in the area and had done much to improve the lot of his tenants, and this project was in keeping with his philanthropic attitude. His widow, the dowager marchioness, therefore gave the area the land. The foundation stone was laid in 1871, and the hospital was formally opened by the bishop of Salisbury three years later. It was originally designed for a mere six patients, the poor of the town, and it was anticipated that they would be attended by their own doctors. The hospital was run by the matron&#8212;as indeed it is today.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/6">The building was enlarged in 1907. An operating theatre, donated by another dowager marchioness of Westminster, was opened. It is still there, but it is no longer an operating theatre. The hospital&#8217;s running costs increased, and the Shaftesbury carnival committee stepped in, and for many years the proceeds from the carnival were donated to the hospital. The committee was rather more powerful than would be expected of such a body nowadays. Indeed, in 1923, it disapproved so strongly of the matron that it refused to hold a carnival that year. The resulting loss of revenue meant that the hospital had to be closed, and the matron then resigned.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/7">Similarly, before 1889 Blandford did not have anywhere to look after the sick and its hospital was funded by the Portman family, which generously donated the land and buildings for the hospital. The present site of the hospital was given by the second Viscount Portman.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/8">About 1,500 patients pass through Shaftesbury hospital, and the friends organisation, which I commend, has estimated that what is done in that hospital saves more than 60,000 miles of travel that would otherwise be covered going to Salisbury district hospital. Such journeys are expensive, stressful and inconvenient to patients, and of course involve unnecessary car use. In its present role, that hospital serves 18,000 patients a year, and the other hospital in my constituency, at Blandford, is thought to serve about 20,000 every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/9">The key issue I would like to address is the ownership of these hospitals. Currently, all Dorset&#8217;s hospitals are run by Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust, which was originally a mental health trust. When the clinical commissioning groups are up and running,</p>
	<p pid="a.474.0/10">the GPs, who are key to the development of today&#8217;s community hospitals, should be recognised again as part of the community, and the community hospitals should be owned by the communities they serve. The friends organisations are key to equipping our local hospitals and at the core of that community interest. I believe that we should harness their enthusiasm and expertise, along with that of GPs, in returning ownership of our community hospitals to the communities they serve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.476.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40642" speakername="Tessa Munt" colnum="476"  time="017:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090631000128">
	<p pid="a.476.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/2">My part of Somerset has some fantastic community hospitals&#8212;Burnham-on-Sea, Glastonbury&#8212;but I would like to draw particular attention to Shepton Mallet, which provides a valuable and popular service to local people in my area of rural Somerset, despite the fact that several of its buildings are substandard as a result of serious under-investment. Many patients who cannot be treated at home are admitted to our community hospitals by local GPs, who love these places, instead of being sent to acute hospitals in Bath, Bristol, Yeovil and Taunton. Most of those journeys are about 20 to 25 miles, but local people accept that acute hospitals will be some distance away. There is no expectation that we should be able to access an acute hospital on our doorstep in such a rural area.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/3">There are 174 communities in my constituency, and people will happily travel from them to those main hospitals. Some spend time in our local hospitals following treatment at an acute hospital&#8212;it is clearly a stage of recuperation&#8212;so that they can be close to their home, friends and family. My father was a patient, and he was a frequent visitor to Wells cottage hospital, which is now unfortunately closed. It was an essential part of his recuperation, and there were many happy visits that kept his spirits up and helped his recovery. People came to read or just talk to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/4">The point will not have been missed that community hospitals help to free up scarce and much more expensive beds in the bigger hospitals. Some of our patients are there because caring for them in their homes has failed or is just not an option. Many patients are elderly or infirm, as often are their relatives, and visiting distant hospitals regularly is a great hardship, stressful and, for some, impossible. Public transport provision in Somerset is limited at best, diminishing in many areas and in most cases almost non-existent in rural patches, as a direct result of the withdrawal of support for public transport by the county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/5">The latest Somerset joint strategy needs assessment on population changes shows rapid increases in elderly patient numbers in the county over the next 30 years&#8212;the expected lifetime of most of our NHS estate buildings. In round terms, the number of over-85-year-olds in the county has doubled in the past 25 years and is expected at least to double again by 2030. Two thirds of our NHS patients are already over 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/6">The community hospital is cost-effective and provides an essential and popular service to the people of Shepton and those in what is a vast local area. Losing its beds would mean a significant reduction in the quality of</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/7">services to the local community. Despite that, Shepton Mallet hospital is under threat of closure. An NHS review of community services for Shepton Mallet is taking place and is focusing on the 17 beds in the community hospital. There is no review of beds in the other 12 community hospitals in Somerset. Campaigners can only assume that Shepton is being singled out, because the NHS has not maintained the hospital properly, despite spending millions on new and other community hospitals. However, in one of the many meetings that I have held with the save our hospital beds campaign group, I was given figures from the NHS that showed that, even as late as this April, bed occupancy has been extremely high. Indeed, April&#8217;s figures show the occupancy rate at over 96%.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/8">Last week I was at the summer fete in Glastonbury, and last month I was at the summer fete at Shepton Mallet hospital. I pay tribute to the leagues of friends of the Shepton Mallet and other community hospitals, and to Mid Somerset Newspapers, which publishes the <i>Shepton Mallet Journal</i>. The friends have done a fantastic job of rallying the people of Shepton and the local press, including the <i>Journal</i>, and have generated enthusiastic support for the save our hospital beds campaign over the past few months. I have received hundreds and hundreds of letters, e-mails and petitions, and have attended many meetings about the issue with concerned local people, which only goes to prove that the hospital is popular and greatly valued. There are now definite indications that the sheer weight of public concern expressed and the influence of our great GPs, working quietly behind the scenes, have had an effect. I pay particular tribute to the local GPs, especially Dr Chris Howes, who keeps trying to retire, but has been busier than ever finding a sensible, practical, realistic and workable solution to the problem facing Shepton. The first aim of the save our hospital beds campaign has been achieved, with the immediate threat of ill-considered cuts averted, and proper evidence gathering and an options appraisal process are now taking place. However, the hospital is not yet safe. Closure would result in short-term savings, but losing the beds would mean a significant reduction in the quality of service to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/9">I finish by asking the Minister for an assurance that the coalition Government are committed to ensuring that local people and local doctors, as well as other health professionals, are consulted fairly and fully about any changes to the role and ownership of our popular, local and essential community hospitals, and that she agrees that none should be closed without agreement and very good cause indeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.477.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing this debate and thank her for doing so. She brings her experience as a doctor, her common sense and some really solid views to the Chamber, and we should listen to her even more.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/2">I think it was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> who described our new Minister as Boadicea. I would welcome her down to Tiverton for a visit to our hospital, but I would rather she took the knives off the chariot as she comes through. Otherwise, we would be delighted to see her.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/3">I think it was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> who made the point about rural constituencies. I am sure that his is bigger than mine, but my constituency covers some 400 square miles. We should remember that community hospitals&#8212;I have them in Tiverton, Honiton and Seaton&#8212;are essential. We also have, like it or not, an ageing population, both among those living in the area and among those who would love to retire there. Devon is a beautiful county and I very much welcome retired people who come there, but the facilities are of course needed. The point has been made by other hon. Members, but the issue is not just the treatment that elderly patients require; it is also about the time it takes to get to a hospital and the need to get there quite quickly. Distance is a problem for many rural patients, especially elderly patients. I would love to have more bus services, but we cannot have them in rural areas, given the sheer lack of numbers of people who travel by bus. It is essential for us to keep our community hospitals running.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/4">I want to talk about one particular hospital and about its management. Dr Frank O&#8217;Kelly runs a clinical practice and commissioning service in Tiverton. He works closely with the hospital and is convinced that we need to get much closer to the people when providing services. I will give a bit of history of Tiverton hospital. Until 2006 it was run by a small community-based PCT in mid-Devon with no acute trust. It was at its most productive at this time and was hailed as one of the best in the country. I must declare an interest as in 2008 my granddaughter was born in Tiverton hospital. Since then it has been run by NHS Devon very much from north Devon, and it is not being used to its full potential. That is where Dr O&#8217;Kelly has some good ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/5">The Tiverton patient-centred care project has been reviewing since February 2012 what is happening and what is to be done to improve the situation at Tiverton hospital, yet it is still not delivering any practical help. There is no doubt that openness and transparency have been the basis of the project, with all the papers published, and five lay members attend the meetings that Dr O&#8217;Kelly organises. The league of friends has been hugely supportive, and with Exeter university devised its own questionnaire for the public. The NHS questionnaire achieved about 800 returns while the league of friends survey produced 3,000. Dr Kelly&#8217;s idea is to get local people interested in how this service is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/6">I would like the Minister to know the key points that Dr Kelly wants to raise. The idea for Tiverton could be rolled out across the country. His plan is that the whole hospital is recommissioned and a single accountable provider brought in to run the hospital and community services. This could be NHS, private or a social enterprise. The provider would need to have as its only focus the community service and tailoring it to maximise capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/7">Ultimately, clinicians and organisations running facilities come and go, but the population whom they serve do not. The population are left with time-limited results of those changes, depending on the length of tenure of the organisations. So to refer again to Dr Frank O&#8217;Kelly, his advice to the politicians would be to give the population much more power so that commissioners and providers are reminded who the customer really is. For a community hospital, this could take the form of a community governing body to which the providers and commissioners were accountable. I want to emphasise that local people</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/8">need to have a much more genuine say in how their hospital is run so that they do not feel that they are caught up in a bureaucratic web and cannot put their views forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.0/9">Tiverton community hospital is an excellent facility. It is pretty new and it could be used to deliver a great deal more local services to patients who need them. So Minister, please, if you have time, come to Tiverton and see what we are trying to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.479.0/1">I thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting this important debate today and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on the eloquent case that she made in opening it. I also congratulate and welcome the new Minister to her place. She was a slightly unconventional Parliamentary Private Secretary to the former Minister of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>. I say &#8220;unconventional&#8221; because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> observed, PPSs are usually seen and not heard. I am sure that she will be even more vocal now that she has the freedom to speak from the Government Front Bench, and I look forward to our exchanges in the coming weeks and months.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/2">As many Members have testified today, community hospitals play an important role in the communities they serve. They provide rehabilitation and follow-up care, and they can help to move care, diagnostics and minor injury and out-patient services, among others, from acute hospitals back to the community. They provide planned and unplanned acute care and diagnostic services for patients closer to home, and contribute to the local community by providing employment opportunities and support for community-based groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/3">It is clear that people generally prefer medical treatments to be taken nearer to their homes and families, whether that involves palliative care, minor injury services or maternity care, and those are exactly the services that community hospitals can help to deliver. Indeed, the Department of Health has estimated that about 25% of hospital patients could be better cared for at home or in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/4">Community hospitals usually also have good relationships with their local communities, and are often supported by local fundraising. We have heard from a number of hon. Members today about the great work being done by friends groups up and down the country. I pay tribute to those groups, and to the staff and volunteers who work to make those groups and the hospitals happen. Staff in community hospitals can also build personal relationships with local patients and carers as they deliver continuous care from outside the hospital environment. That is an important point that should not be overlooked.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/5">It is fair to say that community hospitals continue to play an important part in local health care provision. Their role is valued, and we are right to support it. Labour continues to be committed to community hospitals, when they represent the best solutions for local communities. I take the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> that they might not be the solution everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/6">My own constituency is served by three large district general hospitals and not one community hospital, but I acknowledge that other parts of the country have a very different geographical make-up, and that community hospitals are the right way forward for the provision of health care in those communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/7">Community hospitals can provide a vital step between social care and acute care, and Labour would seek to develop them further. For example, it might be possible for GP or dentistry services to be offered in more community hospitals, which could make some that are only marginally viable at the moment more viable for the future. That possibility should be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/8">Some concerns remain, however, and I hope that the Minister will be able to offer the House some reassurance today. One of the most pressing tasks for the NHS in the coming years will be better to co-ordinate services around the needs of patients, and that might well mean that community hospitals have to change the way in which they provide services and the buildings from which they provide them. She will know, however, of our concerns about the Government&#8217;s structural reforms, which will make the co-ordination and delivery of services far more difficult. We believe that the future requires the integration of care, yet the Government&#8217;s policies are driving us more towards fragmentation. We know that they are already having a profound effect on the NHS. A recent survey of NHS chairs and chief executives by the NHS Confederation found that 28% described the current financial position as</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/9">&#8220;the worst they had ever experienced&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/10">A further 46% said the position was &#8220;very serious&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/11">It is also clear that the financial challenge will continue for many years after 2015, and all this could have an effect on community hospitals, whether it be the reduction of minor injuries provision, the closure of wards or the downgrading of services. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40107" name="Phillip Lee">the hon. Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee)</phrase> suggested in what I thought was a thoughtful contribution, these can sometimes be the right choices for an area. Sometimes, however, they will not be and they will just be financially driven; here, there is a danger that community hospitals will provide an easy cut for bureaucrats.</p>

	<p pid="a.480.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that 3,000 community beds in community hospitals were shut under the previous Government. Is he going to enlighten us about what his policy is, specifically in respect of any particular cuts to community hospitals? Is he in favour of them, against them, or is there no policy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.480.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" speakername="Andrew Gwynne" colnum="480"  time="017:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090631000132">
	<p pid="a.480.1/1">Community hospitals have a vital role to play. As we have discussed in the debate, however, they may not be the right approach everywhere. We remain committed to community hospitals. The last Labour Government introduced a fund specifically for them. It is fair to say that that fund was not automatically taken up by primary care trusts up and down the country. Some areas had different viewpoints on the role of community hospitals. The Labour party has a commitment to community hospitals where they are the right choice for the local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/2">A further point about the impact of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is that with responsibility for commissioning health care services moving into the</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/3">hands of clinical commissioning groups and with primary care trusts no longer being in existence, there is a real danger that the role of community hospitals could be overlooked. Will the Minister reassure us that community hospitals will not be unfairly penalised in the new internal market of the NHS?</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/4">We should bear in mind further issues about the possibility of creeping privatisation&#8212;an issue that we, at least, are concerned about. The whole health service is currently in a state of flux, but as the reforms in the NHS kick in, it is perfectly feasible for commissioning groups to look outside the NHS to the private sector to provide even more of their services than in the past. This has already happened in Suffolk in March, when Serco won a &#163;140 million contract to manage, among other things, the area&#8217;s community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/5">It could well be that when trusts are faced with the choice of reducing clinical services, they will look to being more centralised for financial reasons and take services away from the community and, indeed, in some cases from district general hospitals, too. This will almost certainly have an effect on any extensions to these services in community hospitals. Clearly, community hospitals and other community health services need to be able to compete on a fair playing field with other health providers, and I would ask the Minister how she will support that practically.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/6">I would like to ask about some of the additional funding arrangements in the NHS&#8212;an issue raised by the hon. Member for Totnes in her opening comments. Previously in the NHS, payment by results was introduced to finance care and treatment according to a national tariff. It was intended to reduce variation in the prices paid by different parts of the country and to encourage providers to do more work, particularly helping to reduce waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/7">Community services, however, are not covered by payment by results and are instead paid under a block contract negotiated with the local commissioner. I know that some community hospitals are concerned that they will have to make greater budget reductions than providers covered by payment by results. Some community hospitals are concerned that the commissioner will reduce the size of the block contracts, which is easier to do than stopping activity under a tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/8">From April 2013, the NHS Commissioning Board and Monitor will set the national tariff, and we are encouraged that the Government have expressed an interest in expanding payment by results to community services. If payment by results is expanded, it must be done in a way that supports integrated care and does not disadvantage care that is delivered in a community setting. How will the Minister ensure that we do not have a pricing system that disadvantages care that is delivered in community settings and particularly in community hospitals?</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/9">Let me deal briefly with the issue of estate ownership, which has been touched on by a number of Members. Many community hospitals do not own the buildings from which they operate, which affects their ability to raise capital to create new services for patients because they cannot secure finance or loans against the value of their buildings. As we have already heard during the debate, earlier this year the last Health Secretary announced that a Government-owned firm, NHS Property Services Ltd, would take over the ownership and management</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/10">of the existing primary care trust estate and dispose of property that was surplus to NHS requirements. Community hospitals will depend on the setting of affordable long-term rents by NHS Property Services Ltd. I hope the Minister will tell us how the firm will work with community providers, including social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/11">There should be no doubt that Opposition Members support the principle of community hospitals. Indeed, we rightly established a fund to support and develop the community hospitals that represented the best choice for local communities. A future Labour Government would also aim to develop community services further within community hospitals. For example, as I have already suggested, it may be possible for more GP, dentistry or other services to be offered by them, and I think that that opportunity should be explored further.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/12">We are concerned about some of the wording of the motion, which calls for community hospitals to have</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/13">&#8220;greater freedom to explore different ownership models&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/14">We would need more details of any parameters before agreeing to such an arrangement. It could lead to an opportunity for further creeping privatisation of our national health service, which is something that the Labour party will not support or give carte blanche. For that reason, Labour will abstain on the motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/15">The motion also calls for a national database of community hospitals. Historically their number and location was not monitored, as that was a matter for primary care trusts. However, we believe that in the new NHS, with confusion over where responsibility lies, there may well be a case for a national database. We would be interested to hear more details of what the hon. Member for Totnes has proposed, because we believe that it could give some value to the Department of Health in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/16">We should pay tribute to the important work that community hospitals undertake, the quality of the health care that they give to local people, and the commitment and dedication of all their staff, from medical professionals to porters and cleaners. The Government should be doing all that they can to ensure that patients can make real choices about receiving the health care that they need near to their homes. It remains to be seen how the Government&#8217;s changes to our NHS will affect community services and community hospitals. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how she will protect the role of community hospitals, which are valued and must continue to have a role in the more integrated and people-centred health care system that I hope we all support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.482.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" speakername="Anna Soubry" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="482"  time="017:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0003.htm#12090631000133">
	<p pid="a.482.0/1">Let me begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> on securing the debate, and congratulating not just those who added their names to her motion but all who have spoken in what has been a very interesting and, indeed, passionate debate. In fact it has not really been a debate, because there has been an outbreak of agreement, certainly on the Government Benches, as so many speakers have spoken with such passion about the community hospitals in their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/2">I should also say thank you to all who have congratulated me on my appointment, and have said some rather kind things. I am sure that normal service will soon be</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/3">resumed. Sadly, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, the former Minister with responsibility for health services, has now departed from that post and gone to another place, as it were&#8212;to another Department. We all miss him and thank him for his great service and his commitment to the national health service. He explained to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase> during a debate in June about community hospitals in the north-east that this Government support improvements in community hospitals across the country. That is because we know that community hospitals make it easier for people to get care and treatment closer to where they live. They allow large hospitals to discharge patients safely into more appropriate care. They free hospital beds for people who need them. Community hospitals allow many patients to avoid travelling to large hospitals&#8212;and many of those large, acute hospitals are in cities, with all the attendant problems of transport, parking and so forth.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/4">Our community hospitals provide a wide range of vital services, including minor injury clinics and intensive rehabilitation, on patients&#8217; doorsteps. They can also help save the local NHS money by moving services out of acute hospitals and closer to the people who use them. People are often rightly very protective of their community hospitals, as we have heard from many Members this afternoon. They deliver essential services, and provide employment for people who live nearby and spaces for community groups. It is therefore understandable that community hospitals are fiercely defended and inspire such loyalty.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/5">If I am to retain responsibility for community hospitals, I shall be a busy Minister. I shall be going up to the north-east to Middlesbrough and Cleveland, to South East Cornwall, Bracknell, Newton Abbot, Cannock Chase, West Worcestershire, South Dorset, Penrith and The Border, Halesowen and Rowley Regis, Hexham, North Dorset, Wells, Tiverton and Honiton, including Seaton, and Denton and Reddish&#8212;although not to Southport as it does not have a community hospital. I am grateful for all those invitations, and if I can, I certainly will accept them.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/6">My hon. Friend delivered a speech that was, as ever, thoughtful, inspiring and well-informed, and she asked a number of questions of me. If I do not answer all the points she raised, I hope she will forgive me, and she will certainly get a letter from me answering all of them. Let me state at the outset, however, that she has made a very powerful case in relation to the Community Hospitals Association and its database. Funding for that database was stopped. I cannot promise that it will be restored, but I can say this: I have asked my officials to look at that decision again with great care.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/7">I anticipate that we will not have a vote on this motion, and it is of interest that the two Opposition Members present will abstain if there is a vote, because we have rightly heard a cacophony of voices from the Government Benches in support of community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/8">My hon. Friend asked about tariffs, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>. It may be of some assistance, especially to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase>, for me to state that work is under way in the Department,</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/9">looking at a payment system for patients suffering from long-term conditions. That includes services delivered in community settings. I trust that provides some hope. From 2013 and into 2014, tariff settings will be decided by Monitor and the NHS Commissioning Board. My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes made a powerful point about the potential importance of tariffs in ensuring the future of our community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/10">A good point was made about the decline in the number of GPs in some areas. I hope my hon. Friend will take comfort from the fact that my information is that there is a 50% target in respect of medical trainees going into general practice&#8212;I do not much like targets, but this could be a good one&#8212;and a taskforce has been set up to try to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/11">The future of community hospitals will, I hope, be secure in many of our communities, but it has to be said that many of the concerns Members have raised relate to local decisions, and it would not be right for me, as the Minister, to interfere in any of those decisions. My door is always open and I am always happy to meet hon. Members and any of their constituents. I may not be able to help in Cannock Chase, in Rowley, where there is difficulty, in Wells or in some other places, but I am happy to provide such support, assistance or advice as I am able to give.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/12">Hon. Members have rightly discussed the future of the estate. I am conscious of the time, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I hope you will forgive me if I read out this part of my speech. It is important that hon. Members know and understand that the Health and Social Care Act 2012 required new ownership arrangements for current PCT estates. That means that providers such as community foundation trusts, NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts will be able to take over those parts of the PCT estate that are used for clinical services. That includes the community hospital estate, but&#8212;this is an important but&#8212;we have put safeguards in place so that providers cannot just sell off newly acquired land and make a quick profit. Estates must be offered back to the Secretary of State for Health if, for example, the provider fails to keep the service delivery contract associated with the property or if the property becomes vacant. In addition, where any former estate becomes surplus to NHS requirements 50% of any financial gain made by the provider must be paid back to the Secretary of State and will go straight to front-line NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/13">A Department of Health-owned limited company called NHS Property Services Ltd, to which reference has been made, will take on the remaining estate, as announced in January this year. Its key objective will be to provide clean, safe and cost-effective buildings for use by community and primary care services. I would like to assure every hon. Member, and every member of the public, that any community hospital building taken on by this company will be well looked after. Local clinicians will decide how those estates are used; whether new buildings are built or existing ones are closed will be up to them, as will all decisions about local patient services. As I have said, it is right that these decisions are taken locally. In reality, patients and the public will not notice any difference, at least in the short term. In the longer term, they will see that the NHS estate is managed more efficiently, by people who know what they are doing; that money will go to improve properties and front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/14">NHS Property Services Ltd will own and manage buildings that are needed by the NHS. However, it will also be able to release savings from its properties that are declared surplus to NHS requirements. That money will be used further to improve property provision in the NHS. All PCT properties will transfer to either NHS providers or NHS Property Services Ltd on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-31">31 March 2013</phrase>. Until the provisional lists of property transfers have been finalised later in the year, I cannot confirm whether any particular community hospital will transfer to either an NHS provider or NHS Property Services. In the latter case, the community hospital services provider will become a tenant of NHS Property Services, in the same way that it is currently a tenant of the PCT.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">I am grateful for that question, but I shall be blunt and say that I do not know the answer. I will make inquiries and I will certainly make sure that the hon. Gentleman gets a full report in response.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">Under the statutory provisions, while a building is needed to deliver NHS services, no NHS organisation will be allowed to sell it off. So there is no question of useful NHS property being sold to or transferred to organisations outside the NHS. At the same time, this means that a league of friends&#8212;a number of hon. Members have spoken with great fondness and admiration in support of leagues of friends, and I am sure that they will relay this to their local league of friends and their community hospitals&#8212;is unable to own the freehold of an operational NHS property. A league of friends is able to bid to become an owner of a community hospital only when it is declared surplus to NHS and public sector requirements. Current Government policy is that surplus property should normally be sold by auction or competitive tender. In such cases, the hospital league of friends would be given the opportunity to bid for the property along with all other interested parties. A league of friends could form a social enterprise to compete to provide services from a community hospital but, even then, as a social enterprise rather than an NHS body it could not take ownership of the assets of the community hospital. That might disappoint some, but I hope that in many ways it will give people comfort for the future and go some way towards addressing many of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/3">In conclusion, the Government have taken steps to secure the assets of community hospitals and ensure they are used for the benefit of their community. Those decisions will be made by people qualified to do so. That is the best thing for the hospitals and it is certainly the best thing for the communities that they serve. It is quite clear why so many people speak out so strongly and forcefully about community hospitals; it is because of the great work that they do. On behalf of the Government, I want to pay tribute to everybody who works in community hospitals and all the organisations that support them. I thank everybody who has contributed to the debate, which has been a very good exposition of the fine qualities of our community hospitals and, in</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/4">particular, the organisations, such as the leagues of friends, that do so much to make them the great hospitals that they invariably are.</p>

	<p pid="a.486.0/1">I thank the Minister for her reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/2">Who could forget the passionate cry from the heart from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40543" name="Richard Drax">the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax)</phrase> and the invitation to take cake in Swanage hospital? How wonderful it was to hear an alternative vision for the future from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> and to hear how we could see community hospitals as the heart of community care provision. I hope that the commissioners in south Dorset will see the light and see that that is a much better alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/3">Many Members have contributed to the debate and I am grateful to them all. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase> and from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546" name="Sheryll Murray">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase>, particularly about the difficulties of rurality and transport. We heard likewise from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40566" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase>. We want to tackle rural health inequalities and the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for South East Cornwall clearly made the point that if we do not have transport, that contributes to health inequalities. We heard from my hon. Friends the Members for Bracknell (Dr Lee) and for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) about the need for leadership and how we can deliver the right care at the right time and in the right place.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase> made a knowledgeable contribution about different ownership models in her constituency. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40426" name="Anne-Marie Morris">the Member for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris)</phrase>, whose constituency neighbours mine, paid tribute to the marvellous stroke service that operates out of her community hospital. She also spoke knowledgeably about the problems with PFI in the NHS that have dogged so many hospitals and burdened the NHS with unnecessary debt. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40291" name="James Morris">the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris)</phrase> spoke about the campaign to keep in-patient beds at Rowley and it is clearly disappointing that we will not be able to see more direct intervention on unnecessary closures in parts of the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/5">It was good to hear the speech from the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>, but Labour Members are not so much abstaining as absenting themselves from the debate, which is clearly disappointing. I assure him that I fully understand that there must be reassurance for the future that community hospitals will always stay for the benefit of their local communities and that it is good to hear the Minister reiterate that very important point. If we are going to see the contribution from leagues of friends continuing for the future, they must have absolute confidence that those valuable community assets will always stay for the benefit of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/6">I thank all Members for their contributions and pay tribute to all the staff and leagues of friends of our wonderful community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/8" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="a.486.0/9">That this House recognises and supports the contribution of community hospitals to the care of patients within the National Health Service; requests the Secretary of State for Health to commission a comprehensive database of community hospitals, their ownership and current roles; and believes that the assets of community hospitals should remain for the benefit of their community while allowing them greater freedom to explore different ownership models.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.2/1">This year, all over the country there has been a shortage of primary school places. I wish to highlight the issue of pupil place provision in the Chafford Hundred area of my constituency and address the human consequences of the state failing to deliver against the legitimate expectations of parents for a local school place. Before I do, I must welcome the Minister of State, Department for Education, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40680" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr Laws)</phrase>. It is his first time at the Dispatch Box for some time and I think that I speak for many hon. Friends when I say that it is good to see him back as a member of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/2">In theory, we have a system for managing school place allocations in which parental choice is the guiding principle, but for too many parents in my constituency there is, frankly, no choice. The changing demographics of the area have led to insufficient capacity in the west of the borough, where the population is increasing, and over-provision in the east. The result is that parents, far from choosing schools, too often are expected to take what they are given, as inevitably the most popular schools are over-subscribed. This has been a particular problem in the Chafford Hundred area for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/3">To put the problem in context, Chafford Hundred is a settlement of modern, high-density housing that started to come together only in 1989. It is an attractive suburb, especially for families, and a self-contained community hemmed in by major roads such as the A13. It is widely accepted locally that when the modern housing was built insufficient attention was paid to ensuring satisfactory public service provision for the area. Complaints about inadequate GP provision and insufficient school places have been a common complaint ever since. This year the problem has been particularly acute.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/4">The area&#8217;s changing demographics have been accelerated by the fact that rising property prices and inward migration have led to families occupying less space than would have been expected in the 1980s. Flats in Chafford that were intended for young single people are now occupied by families with children, which has led to increasing demand for school places. Taken together, these factors have made it a considerable challenge for the local education authority to ensure that the provision of school places keeps pace with demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/5">This year the three primary schools in Chafford offered some 270 reception places between them. That number was short of the demand by 51. What has made that particularly difficult locally is the fact that many parents had no awareness of the under-provision and the news that they could not send their children to any of the three local schools that serve the suburb came as a real shock and caused considerable distress. Many of the parents have accepted the alternative places offered by the local council, but as of today there are six children without a place.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/6">Thurrock council argues that reasonable offers of alternative places have been made to the parents. I would like to explore with the Minister what constitutes a reasonable offer. The parents object, in particular, to</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/7">the fact that some of the school places they have been offered are more than 3 miles away from their home, distances that are clearly not walkable for five-year-old children. The area is also not well served by public transport. Furthermore, five of the six children had attended pre-school at the schools where they were seeking a place. Again, the parents had every expectation that their demands to stay at the schools would be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/8">The parents are chastising themselves for being so naive as to assume that their children would automatically get a school place locally, but it really should not be too much to ask. All the families work hard and pay their taxes. The only things they expect from the state are to have their bins emptied, to be able to go to a local doctor and to have a school to send their children to. This seems to be one of the occasions when those who work hard, do the right thing and do their best for their families end up being poorly supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/9">One of the worst outcomes is the degree to which this pits parent against parent in the scramble for a place when all are equally entitled. Indeed, one of the parents was told that the LEA cannot discriminate against people who are less articulate than they are, as if being one of the unfortunate ones who missed out on a place was not itself an injustice.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/10">I have been impressed by the spirit that the parents have shown in continuing to press their case. Earlier this year, the children themselves went to Downing street to present a petition to the Prime Minister. The image of the children chanting &#8220;Walk to school&#8221; as they marched up Downing street will stay with me for some time. I am sad to say that the parents have largely been seen as a nuisance by the LEA and are very bruised by their attempts to press their case. They should not be made to feel that way. These people have not failed; they are victims of a failure by the state to deliver against their expectations. All they want is the best for their children, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In failing them, the local authority should not be causing further distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/11">All of us, as public servants, need to be more honest about where we fail, because we will undermine trust in politicians and the state if we are not. Good leadership is acknowledging when something has gone wrong and doing something constructive about it, not shooting the messenger and hoping they will go away. I am sorry to report that members of the council have been more interested in debating the potential replacement of the GCSE than in exploring practical responses to this problem. It is incumbent on all local councillors to realise that it is their job to ensure that the authority delivers on its obligations rather than debate matters of national policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/12">For my part, I am not satisfied that the offers made by the council are reasonable given the circumstances of these children. There are very strong reasons why parents are relying on a local school place. For example, Madison Horwood has a little brother called Mason who requires regular treatment at Great Ormond Street hospital, and her mother relies on her friends and neighbours to get Madison to school while she is taking Mason to hospital. Hayden Agambar has a little brother called Tommy who is attending pre-school at one of the local schools the children wish to attend. When his mother asked the council how she could be in two places at once, she was</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/13">advised that as there was no legal requirement to attend pre-school she should remove Tommy from his place. That is not an acceptable response at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/14">There appeals process should overrule the LEA where there is a strong case for doing so, and understandably the parents have gone through this process, but they report to me that the system lacked integrity. For example, Hermione Williams&#8217;s paperwork was lost twice. I am also advised that Thurrock council did not run the appeals process in line with the current guidance issued in February this year. Parents are meant to be given 20 days to prepare and lodge their appeal, but they were given only 14 days. Appellants are supposed to be given 10 days&#8217; notice of their appeal hearing, but one parent received one day&#8217;s notice. Panel members overseeing the appeals were often not presented with papers until the day of the appeal. Another parent felt that the admissions officer made comments regarding her dealings with the council that were prejudicial to her getting a fair hearing. Furthermore, the rules say that an authority should not limit the grounds for appeal, but I am advised that Thurrock council&#8217;s letter to appellants tried to imply that they could appeal in only two areas. As a result of all this, the parents do not feel that they have had a fair opportunity to appeal against the decision made by Thurrock council and believe that the process was run in a way that would have only one outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/15">In the meantime, five of the parents of these six children still have no school place. The parents are considering developing ways of home educating rather than accepting the offers made to them, which they continue to argue are unreasonable. At the same time, they are worried that removing their children from school may not be the best thing for them. They are wrestling with a very distressing conflict that I am having to witness.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/16">In the longer term, we can deal with these problems. We obviously need additional school provision in Thurrock and in the Chafford Hundred area, and I am pleased to say that the local community has got behind a proposal for a free school. I hope that the Minister will look on that bid with sympathy when it is ultimately submitted. I think that lessons have been learned from this episode. Certainly, as the population of Thurrock grows there will be much more focus on ensuring that we have satisfactory school provision in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/17">In the meantime, we have to think about these six children. We are not talking about numbers but individual people: Hayden, Ava, Hermione, Madison, Holly and James. They deserve a school place. I am not generally in favour of forcing schools to take more children against their will, but we have nine reception classes in Chafford, and I would like to make one final appeal to see whether we can make every effort to get a school place locally for these children.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/18">I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s observations on a very unhappy episode that I know has been repeated elsewhere in the country. I also invite his observations on how LEAs should ensure that they meet their obligations under the Education Act 2011 to ensure that there is adequate provision, particularly against the backdrop of free schools. Bids for free schools will be more forthcoming in some areas of the country than in others, but local authorities still have a responsibility to make sure that there is an adequate supply of school places. I would also welcome the Minister&#8217;s observations</p>
	<p pid="a.488.2/19">on what he expects of local authorities when they handle an appeals process and on what constitutes a fair hearing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-09-06a.491.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40680" speakername="David Laws" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Education"  colnum="491"  time="018:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120906/debtext/120906-0004.htm#12090631000138">
	<p pid="a.491.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40607" name="Jackie Doyle-Price">the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price)</phrase> for her kind words and congratulate her on securing this extremely important debate for her constituents. I hope, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you and the hon. Lady will indulge me by allowing me to say that this is the first time since the recent ministerial changes that an Education Minister has appeared at the Dispatch Box, and I want to place on record my tribute to those who left the Department as part of the recent changes&#8212;my hon. Friends the Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb), for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) and for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes). They all made an enormous contribution to education policy, and many hon. Members will have benefited from the work that they did during their time at the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/2">I know, from my own time as a Member of this House, about the tireless efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock on not just education issues, but a range of things that are of great importance to her constituents. She has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents to raise the issue of school places in Thurrock. She has written to the Prime Minister, and I believe that she has received a response from the Education Secretary. She has also forwarded the local community&#8217;s petition on this matter. It is understandable that she is very passionate, as are her constituents, that children who live in Chafford Hundred should be educated in accessible local schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/3">I will respond to the specific questions raised by my hon. Friend. I am grateful to her for giving me advance notice of her particular points. That has been extremely helpful for the departmental officials, who have contacted the council to get more detailed responses to them. I am grateful to those officials for engaging in that process over the past week and, indeed, for resolving some issues today after we discussed the matter this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/4">I hope that the hon. Lady will allow me to start by setting out the national picture, which is relevant to the circumstances in her area and to the requirements placed on councils and the ways in which the Government are seeking to address her concerns. I will then address directly the specific local issues that she has understandably raised about her constituency circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/5">It is unfortunately the case that currently there are simply not enough places at good and popular schools in some areas of high demand. The Government have shown that they are determined to tackle that problem, whether by addressing underperformance in our schools, by expanding the academies programme, or by making additional capital available in the areas of greatest demand. The Government are determined to give more parents a real choice, and that can only happen when every local school is a good one. Let me say a bit more about the steps that we have already taken to tackle the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/6">On funding, we are facing, not just in the hon. Lady&#8217;s constituency, but in particular parts of England, a sustained increase in the number of children of primary school age. Since 2002, there has been a continuous rise in the number of births in England and some areas are facing significant pressure on places, as she described effectively. We as a Government have inherited a serious challenge in the problem of growing numbers and we are determined to address it.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/7">That is why, despite the very difficult economic circumstances that we inherited when we formed the coalition Government in 2010, we have prioritised funding to support the provision of additional pupil places where they are needed. We have doubled the rate of annual spending on primary school places from the levels that we inherited and, in addition, we have allocated a further &#163;1.1 billion over the past year, bringing to &#163;2.7 billion the total that we have made available to support basic need. That funding is provided directly to local authorities to help them meet their statutory duty to provide sufficient schools to meet pupil need. As my hon. Friend pointed out, so far under this Government, Thurrock has received &#163;8.7 million in basic need funding, which is more than double the &#163;4.1 million that the local authority received over the entire period of the last spending review under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/8">Local authorities should be best placed to decide how to use that funding and will deploy a range of solutions to create additional places, from reconfiguring existing space to finding temporary or permanent solutions. Where necessary, they will provide transport to ensure that children can attend a suitable place. We are working closely with local authorities and will continue to work to reduce costs so that every single pound goes as far as possible in providing long-term solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/9">Obviously, as my hon. Friend will understand, the Department&#8217;s capital funding is limited and it is crucial that we target it effectively. That is why the methodology that we now use to allocate funding is focused increasingly on the number of spare places in the system, rather than more bluntly on the growth in pupil numbers. We are going further. For the first time this year, we are collecting information from local authorities that will provide a greater understanding of the more localised place pressures within a local authority, including in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency. That approach will help us direct our limited capital funds to the local authorities where the demographic pressures are greatest, as she would expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/10">My hon. Friend is right to highlight the importance of parents having a choice of good schools for their children. The law states that, where possible, parents will be offered a place for their child at their highest preferred school and have the ability to nominate at least three preferences. The Department for Education does not collect preference data on primary admissions. The 2012 secondary data showed that nationally, 85.3% of parents were offered a place for their child at their first preference school, and 97.6% were offered a place at one of their preferred schools. In February this year, we published revised admissions and appeals codes that removed much of the bureaucracy that schools and local authorities previously faced in the admissions process. We have also ensured that they are easier for parents to navigate and understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/11">It is, regrettably, a regular feature of the correspondence that the Department for Education receives from parents that they are unable to get their children into their</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/12">choice of a good local school. The problem is that there are simply not enough places at good and popular schools, especially in areas of high demand. That means that local authorities need to make difficult decisions. It is essential that they do all they can to make reasonable offers to parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/13">I am aware that many parents are offered the option of transport for their children when the school is a distance from home. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that suitable travel arrangements are made for pupils who live further away from the school than the prescribed statutory walking distances, which are 2 miles for children under the age of eight and 3 miles for those aged eight or over. As my hon. Friend hinted, parents are of course nervous about using transport for young children, which is why we seek to increase the supply of places in local schools, as our constituents want.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/14">As hon. Members are aware, regulations limit the size of an infant class during an ordinary teaching session to 30 pupils per school teacher. We have no plans to change that law, as the evidence shows that smaller class sizes can have a significant positive impact on the progress of pupils in that age group.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/15">Parents can be given a real choice only when every local school is a good school. We are determined to tackle underperformance where it exists. This month, we are opening 282 new academies. International evidence shows that a more autonomous school system helps to drive up standards. We are also creating a system of school-to-school improvement. We expect all schools that are performing well and that apply for academy status to partner a weaker school.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/16">Up and down the country, as my hon. Friend mentioned, free schools are being set up in response to parental demand for a school that meets the specific needs of the local area. They respond to a need for greater choice and better educational standards, and many of them are providing pupil places in areas with a shortage of school places as well as in areas of high deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/17">I am aware that my hon. Friend is a strong supporter of the Gateway academy in its bid to open a new free school in the Tilbury area of Thurrock, and I congratulate all those involved in the successful Gateway primary free school development, which has opened as scheduled this week. I heard her other points and representations on the subject and will ensure that we keep the situation under close review. I believe that my colleague in the other place will lead on the free schools programme, but no doubt officials will note and pass on the comments that my hon. Friend has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/18">On the other specific local issues that my hon. Friend raised, particularly those relating to the community in Chafford Hundred, I will address the concerns that she sensibly expressed in advance of the debate to enable me to look into those matters in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/19">As I said, departmental officials have spoken to officers in Thurrock local authority to seek further information on the arrangements that they have put in place. They have told my officials that a significant proportion of the basic need funding that the council has received has been spent on providing additional places in Chafford Hundred. Some &#163;2.6 million was spent on expanding Tudor Court primary school in time for the new academic year, and I understand that Thurrock council has undertaken a detailed piece of pupil planning work</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/20">to examine demand over the next three to five years. It intends to publish it shortly for consultation, with the outcomes informing its spending plans. I fully expect it to engage with my hon. Friend in an early and constructive way to seek her views about those plans and ensure that they are informed by her views and her understanding of local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/21">Of course, as we have heard, the priority for parents and children is securing a suitable place right now. I am certainly concerned to hear about the circumstances of some children who are not able to access schools. I am assured that all children in the area have been offered places to start school this September, although not necessarily in Chafford Hundred itself, as my hon. Friend indicated. Such decisions are always incredibly hard and must take into account local issues and circumstances, so it would be wrong to prescribe from the centre precisely what constitutes a reasonable offer. However, there is clearly a legitimate concern about what is reasonable in a local context, and it is absolutely right that she should have raised that issue today and that it should be a matter for debate. There should not just be an assumption that, provided a place can be offered within a particular area, that meets the definition of reasonableness.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/22">I am concerned to hear that the parents of children in Chafford Hundred do not believe that they have had a fair opportunity to make their appeal. When parents believe that their appeal has not been heard in a fair and lawful way, there is a clear process for them to challenge the outcome on the grounds of maladministration. My hon. Friend mentioned the issue of parents getting only 14 days&#8217; notice, which the Department&#8217;s officials have raised with the local authority. Our officials have been assured that the local council sent out letters offering the full 20 days of consultation, but I understand that council officials believe that the letters may have been held up in the post. I am sure the local authority will want to improve that situation in future following her powerful points on behalf of her constituents. As she said, it will now be for the local government ombudsman to investigate any outstanding complaints in this particular instance. The authority has stressed to my officials the steps that it has taken to comply with the statutory duties placed on it by the admissions and appeals codes.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/23">In the case of documentation being issued late&#8212;another matter that my hon. Friend raised&#8212;the local authority has assured departmental officials of the steps that it has taken with affected parents to resolve the issue. Furthermore, the local authority has confirmed that checks are, or will be, in place to ensure&#8212;as far as possible&#8212;that such a situation does not happen again. The authority remains committed to engaging with the Department and with communities to ensure that best practice on admissions and appeals is fully incorporated, and to continue to improve the service that is delivered to communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/24">I hope I have responded to some of my hon. Friend&#8217;s concerns. The key locally is to secure a proper, long-term solution that meets her reasonable expectations and those of her community. That is why the current detailed planning work is so crucial, and it is important that my hon. Friend engages fully with it once it is completed so that she can speak on behalf of her communities and express whether the work undertaken by the council meets expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/25">I assure my hon. Friend that I will take a keen interest in this issue, and I hope that she will contact me again if she feels in any way dissatisfied with how things progress.</p>
