This week, we have seen an announcement showing the lowest level of crime for 14 years and the highest level of confidence in policing for a very long time.

	<p pid="c.537.4/1">It is very important to make this situation clear. Northern Ireland Ministers asked for APD to be devolved only for bands B, C and D, and we were able to meet that request, thanks to our all-listening Chancellor. We have not been asked to devolve band A flights, which would reduce the block grant by a substantial amount. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question allows me the opportunity to tell the House that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have been very proactive on this matter, working with the local Minister of Enterprise, Trade, and Investment, Arlene Foster. As the hon. Gentleman says, my right hon. Friend has to Willie Walsh a number of times. Keeping those routes open from Belfast to Heathrow is very good news.</p>

	<p pid="c.553.0/1">We have not seen much of the Secretary of State since he took up his post. If that is the best that he can offer after a number of absences from the Chamber, I worry about this Government and their handling of one of the most important areas for consumers and for jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.553.0/2">It is absolutely true that in reshaping the energy market to provide a low-carbon future, there are pressures. We have never denied that. However, today we are talking about the efforts to make the energy market more competitive; how we can ensure that a trail of energy companies is not investigated for mis-selling and dodgy dealing; and the increasing number of families who, under this Government, are paying more than they need to. The Government are stepping away from any responsibility to help the most vulnerable people in this country to tackle their fuel bills and keep their energy consumption down. It is possible to have policies on that, while recognising that there are pressures in the bigger scheme of things. It is a given that there are pressures&#8212;it is what a Government do about them that counts. This Government are doing nothing at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.553.0/3">In government, we put tough obligations on all the big energy companies to use some of their profits to help poorer customers in deprived areas make their homes more energy-efficient. The community energy saving programme was meant to help 90,000 households. Two and a half years into the scheme&#8212;most of it under this Government&#8212;and with only a matter of months left, just 30,000 households have been helped. What are the Government doing about that? As far as we know, they are doing absolutely nothing.</p>
	<p pid="c.553.0/4">We do know that the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, had a meeting with all the big energy companies on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-01">1 February</phrase> this year. We also know that the energy companies are lobbying the Government to relax the obligations on them or to push back the deadline. The Minister refuses to tell us what exactly was discussed at the meeting, what was agreed and whether he has caved in to the companies&#8217; demands. Why will he not tell us that? He will not share with us&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.555.0/1">All fine words, but obviously the excuse for not sharing is changing as the debate continues. What is very clear from that answer is that it is all flannel, all rhetoric. There is no sense of what demands the Government have put on the energy companies, or of whether the companies will have to meet those demands by the set deadline, a few months hence, or of whether the number of families helped will increase from 30,000 to the 90,000 the companies are supposed to be helping. There is no sense of clarity, and no practical suggestions or effort by this Government to get a grip. On delivery, the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, has previous in so many other areas that it is becoming rather a pattern.</p>
	<p pid="c.555.0/2">The truth is that the Government have not defined what action they will take. They hold private meetings in which they are not willing even to share some practical explanation of what will happen next. Is it impossible to understand why the public are feeling so let down and why organisations that support families in difficult circumstances are worried about whether this Government have the gumption to get on top of this issue, when they are failing in so many other areas? If there is a choice between the interests of the big energy companies and those of people who are struggling to make ends meet, it seems that under this Government the energy companies win every time. That is the real problem with the Government: not only are they out of touch, but they stand up for the wrong people.</p>

	<p pid="c.564.2/1">As always, my right hon. Friend has come up with an ingenious idea. The good news is that the Deputy Prime Minister, following my work with energy companies, is already on to that, through this annual communication that the big six will now send out to ensure that people know the best tariff for them. However, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> is right that local authorities have a role&#8212;in the green deal and many other things. I am happy to talk to him in detail about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.564.2/2">My right hon. Friend might also be interested to know that the collective switching schemes we are trying to promote through trusted third party intermediaries, such as Which?, are beginning to take off. A lot of social housing providers and councils are interested in seeing whether they can work with their communities to push these schemes, and People&#8217;s Power, a social housing provider, has pushed the huge switch after the big switch. That is exceedingly good news.</p>

	<p pid="c.567.3/1">Welcome to our debate, Mr Deputy Speaker; it is good to see you again.</p>
	<p pid="c.567.3/2">My intention today is to talk about aspects of family life and how they relate to the &#8220;cost of living&#8221; theme. However, as a former Energy Minister, I am bound to say that I have been stimulated by the debate to make a few other remarks. Let me offer some friendly advice to the Secretary of State: his soundbite of the speech&#8212;that he is in favour of the &#8220;solar many&#8221; rather than the &#8220;solar few&#8221;&#8212;may not go viral. Indeed, I think it represents a formidable rewriting challenge for his speechwriters, if I may say so.</p>
	<p pid="c.567.3/3">I will not get too cross with the Secretary of State for saying, as a bit of political knockabout, that the last Labour Government made no strategic decisions at all. Empirically, that is incorrect, as I think of the formidable legislation on climate change, which was supported throughout the House. For the first time, Parliament&#8212;the Labour Government were in power&#8212;decided to legislate to reduce carbon emissions. That is probably the most radically ambitious piece of legislation ever to go before this House. As I recall&#8212;I do not work for News International, so I do have a memory&#8212;it was also the Labour Government who set renewable energy targets,</p>
	<p pid="c.567.3/4">although they were more than just targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.567.3/5" class="italic">[Interruption.] </p>
	<p pid="c.567.3/6">I hear a Member mumbling &#8220;Europe&#8221; at me from a sedentary position. I do not know whether it was a Eurosceptic, but yes, of course Europe is relevant; our party believes in Europe. We subscribe to European targets and during the period of the Labour Government we became the biggest country in the world in terms of investment in offshore wind. So much for us not having any strategic direction!</p>

	<p pid="c.569.3/1">I am a kind person, and I suppose it was major until recently. That party was adamantly opposed to nuclear energy. I ask the Secretary of State whether he has now made a strategic realignment in his own mind to support nuclear energy. I hope he has. I think the fact that the Prime Minister has appointed Liberal Democrat Members to this important role of Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change shows that he maintains a sense of humour&#8212;one that he will need in the weeks and the trials, which is a term I use in the generic sense, to come.</p>
	<p pid="c.569.3/2">While I am speaking about energy policy rather than family policy, which I shall come on to in a moment, I want to emphasise the importance of the global context. We cannot discuss this issue only domestically. If I am right, the International Energy Agency projects in one of its central scenarios that global energy demand, mainly from non-OECD countries, will rise by about 40% by 2035. We must view our issues within that global context, we have to take energy security seriously and we have to build up what I have always called home-grown energy as much as we can, alongside reducing energy demand&#8212;hence the importance of nuclear and of renewable energy.</p>

	<p pid="c.574.4/1">I understand that point, which raises the difficult issue of what financial allowance we can make for parental leave. We need to get to grips with this.</p>
	<p pid="c.574.4/2">I turn to an issue that the House has discussed before. I put it to the Government that their policy on child benefit is a case study in unintended consequences&#8212;and I am being kind here. I speak as a great of advocate of child benefit, which, along with the family allowance before it, has had its supporters on both sides of the House, right back to the pioneering work of Eleanor Rathbone, who wrote such important works on the importance of what she called family endowment. This Government&#8217;s decision to end the universal nature of child benefit by withdrawing it from people who earn above a certain income is a catastrophic strategic decision. It is a move towards potential means-testing that we need to be aware of.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-16c.577.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" speakername="Edward Leigh" colnum="577"  time="014:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120516/debtext/120516-0002.htm#12051642001067">
	<p pid="c.577.1/1">I am talking about total taxation, which is the important thing to understand. I know that it is difficult to compare countries. For instance, we often talk about Italy being a basket case in terms of Government borrowing, but private borrowing is very low in Italy. We have to address this problem by considering the total taxation of all output, because that is what is of interest to efficiency and an efficient Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/2">As I was saying, big government is accompanied by big waste. I am sure that many hon. Members were shocked, as I was, by a National Audit Office report in January&#8212;or rather by a report of reports; I am sure that everybody in this House avidly reads what the NAO says every week. This report was published in January, so it was not an attack on the previous Labour Government; it relates to now and the situation this minute. It is about this apparently hard-hitting, right-wing Government who are cutting left, right and centre, and persecuting the people&#8212;that is the charge against the Government; I would not say anything like that, of course. The report suggests that there is waste, at the moment, of more than &#163;31 billion across government. Hon. Members may recall that Philip Green carried out an efficiency review, after which he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/3">&#8220;You could not be in business if you operated like this. It would be impossible.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/4">His review identified, among other things, &#163;700 million in saving on the Government telephone bill alone. In the past two Parliaments, the Public Accounts Committee conducted more than 400 hearings on waste. Such hearings are carrying on in this Parliament, as they will in the next Parliament and the Parliament after that. Nobody can tell me that enormous opportunities to cut waste do not remain.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/5">Why is that issue important, given that this is a debate on the cost of living? This is not some anorak issue in which only accountants or economists should be interested. Every taxpayer in this country should be interested in</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/6">what is going on in government at the moment, because the public sector is funded from the pockets of ordinary people and ordinary firms&#8212;many of them small, struggling firms&#8212;across Britain. Spending money in such a way means that the public and firms are being hit by a double-whammy, as prices are inflated by wasteful government spending, and firms have less of their own money to invest and families have less to spend. That situation is not fair.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/7">We have mentioned the complexities of the benefits system and discussed child benefit. In addition to a hugely wasteful government system, Britain suffers from a horrendously complex tax system. Our tax code is now the longest in the world. Do a Conservative Government find that satisfactory? Our tax code has recently overtaken India&#8217;s in length and has doubled in size since 1997. Our horrendously complex tax system may have allowed the previous Government to keep many of their taxes a secret, but it has led to Britain being ranked 89th in the world, behind Nigeria and Zimbabwe, on the burden of government regulation in a recent World Economic Forum report. That simply is not good enough. I know that my friends on the Treasury Bench are doing their best, but they are not trying hard enough. They have to do better, because ordinary people and ordinary firms are paying for all this.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/8">That complexity is structurally biased against ordinary workers and small businesses, because they lack the resources to investigate all the available loopholes. According to the Centre for Policy Studies, the effective marginal tax rate for some people on low incomes is as high as 96%. We know that, because we have done all these studies; the right hon. Members for Croydon North and for Birkenhead (Mr Field) served with me on the Select Committee on Social Security for many years, and for many years the right hon. Member for Birkenhead has campaigned on the issue of the trap for ordinary people, particularly those at the bottom of the heap, of paying marginal tax rates of 96%. We are crushing our own people, and not just with the waste for which we are responsible in our own spending. We oversee that waste in this House of Commons&#8212;we are responsible for it; nobody else out there is responsible. We crush our own people under a hugely wasteful system of government inefficiency and with increasingly complex taxes and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/9">The rich do not suffer from that. The marginal tax rate for top-rate taxpayers is just 57.8%&#8212;the very richest do not even pay that. They do not even pay 57%. With the benefit of having successful and hugely expensive accountants, they are paying 10% or 15%.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/10">In the most recent global competitors report by the World Economic Forum, three of the four biggest problems facing UK businesses were identified as tax rates, tax regulations and inefficient Government bureaucracy. Let me set out what I believe we should have in the Government. Apparently we are going to have a reshuffle soon. What we need are Ministers&#8212;the Prime Minister has to check on their performance&#8212;who are, like a non-executive director on the board of a private company such as Tesco, obsessed not by policy but by efficiency. We have three excellent Ministers sitting on the Front Bench&#8212;the Secretary of State for Transport, the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40639" name="Charles Hendry">the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> and the Minister of State, Department of</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/11">Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>&#8212;as well as our Whip. I am sure they are doing these sorts of things every day, but much more could be done. I hope the Whip is listening to all the kind comments I am making about the Ministers. I sincerely believe that this is one of the most important things the Government could do.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/12">An obvious conclusion to reach, given what I have said, is that the tax system should be simplified. That would reduce costs and simultaneously be likely to increase revenues. As I have argued again and again, this is not necessarily a market-driven, right-wing point of view, because the lower-paid would benefit from it. The natural conclusion of such simplification would be a much flatter rate, or even a flat-rate tax system. Such a system has been successfully introduced in places as diverse as Serbia, Hong Kong and Russia. When I was in Russia recently, I spoke to a young entrepreneur. The flat-rate tax in Russia is 13%. How extraordinary that the former Soviet Union now has a more entrepreneurially based system than we have&#8212;a flat-rate tax of 13% in a large economy such as Russia.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/13">There is a precedent for such an approach in this country. When the Thatcher Government more than halved the top tax rate, the proportion of income tax revenue paid by the highest earners rose. As I said in our debates on the Budget, I welcome what the Chancellor of the Exchequer did in cutting the top rate from 50% to 45%; indeed, I think it should be cut from 45% to 40%. Such people do not bury their money in the ground. If they are taxed less there is more entrepreneurship and more of them stay in this country. They earn more and give more, and less effort is spent on tax evasion and tax avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.577.1/14">As important as tax reform is, the key to Government finance is a reduction in spending. If we spend less, we can tax less&#8212;it is that simple. There is nothing inherently good about Government spending, although Ministers from parties on both sides of the House have apparently congratulated themselves on how much they have spent on the health service and education. They congratulate themselves on spending inefficiently what other people earn.</p>

	<p pid="c.586.2/1">I do agree, and at some point we can have the debate about why we need that reform to have a properly democratically accountable Chamber in the other place, but now is not that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.586.2/2">We heard an interesting take from the hon. Member for Gainsborough on how the Government would be doing much better if they were a pure Conservative Government&#8212;they would be cutting much more&#8212;and we heard from the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton that they are cutting far too savagely. The truth is that a pure Conservative Government probably would be cutting more and we are acting as a restraint on that and trying to achieve the correct outcome, which lies somewhere between the&#8212;in my view&#8212;excessive cuts advocated by one side and the continued overspending advocated by the other.</p>
	<p pid="c.586.2/3">There is often a debate about Keynesian economics. Keynes was a good Liberal and a good Cambridge man, and he said a number of very sensible things. One was about making sure that we spend in recessions, but the flip side of that is that we do not spend as much during the boom years, so that we have money left. We cannot spend in the boom and also have money to spend in the bust; it simply does not work. Keynes was also clear about how much could be spent and, indeed, the high priority on keeping bond yields low so all that could be afforded. He was a very complex man and his work should not be reduced to a simple catch phrase.</p>
	<p pid="c.586.2/4">I want to talk about the cost of living in relation to transport, because it is one of the areas I focus on in this House and on which I lead for the Liberal Democrats, but also because it is one of the few parts of Government activity that affects most people pretty much every day of their lives. Transport has a huge effect on us, and the costs of travel affects a huge amount of what we do throughout our lives. Governments for many decades, when focusing on the cost of transport, have thought principally about cars; too little thought has been given to cycling, walking and public transport.</p>

	<p pid="c.600.0/1">I absolutely agree that we need to work together on long-term planning to get back some of the refining capacity that we have lost. I also think we should consider the potential for differential taxation of diesel and unleaded petrol, which most other countries in Europe already have, and I have mentioned that idea in previous debates.

	<p pid="c.600.0/2">Pensioners are people living on fixed incomes and are directly affected by changes in the cost of necessities. I am proud that our coalition Government has not only restored the link between the basic state pension and earnings, which the Labour Government failed for such a long time to do, but strengthened it with the triple-lock guarantee. It is crucial that the Government legislate to make public sector pensions sustainable&#8212;to reduce the cost not just for the sake of it, but so that we can continue to provide high-quality pensions for public servants.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/3">Council tax is a major issue for pensioners, and we have a good record on keeping it frozen. Earlier, we heard a little Labour triumphalism from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40387" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> about the local election results, but I am pleased to say that, in Worcester, the Conservatives remain the largest group, although Labour gained seats and the Liberal Democrats lost one to us. The Liberal Democrats are now working with the Conservative administration in Worcester to try to make the council more efficient and to keep council tax down.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/4">As I said, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> spoke passionately about social care. I am pleased to see in the Queen&#8217;s Speech a draft Bill on modernising social care, but I agree with the hon. Lady that there is more to be done and that the Government have to take yet more action to tackle the enormous challenges set out clearly in the Dilnot review. I urge the Government to make swift progress on that issue, which is hugely important for the long term. As has been pointed out, Labour does not have a strong record of addressing it.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/5">Part of the cost of living is the need to ensure that there is the best possible support for those in the later stages of life, which means better provision of social care as well as more investment in palliative care, an issue that is dear to my heart.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/6">I am glad that the Government are doing more to support families by expanding child credits for those most in need, protecting child benefit for people earning up to &#163;50,000 and expanding the provision of nursery education. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40191" name="Malcolm Wicks">The right hon. Member for Croydon North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> described the changes to child benefit as a &#8220;case study in unintended consequences&#8221;, and that accusation certainly could be levelled, but I would say they are a case study of the Government listening to concerns and doing something about them. That is to be commended.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>, in an earlier part of the Queen&#8217;s Speech debate, and the right hon. Member for Croydon North today, pointed out that child care is a huge cost to many families. Like them, I hope that the Government can do more to help on that front in the future. I hope the contentious and argumentative line in the Gracious Speech that states:</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/8">&#8220;My Government will strive to improve the lives of children and families&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/9">will enable the Government to act on both that issue and the essential one of delivering fairer funding for our schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.600.0/10">The greatest thing that the Government can do to improve the standards of living of people in this country, and to help them overcome the challenge of the rising cost of living, is to succeed on the economy. As I mentioned earlier, there has been some commentary that there was not enough about the economy in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. As I discussed with businesses at my business breakfast in Worcester last week, that misunderstands what the Queen&#8217;s Speech is about. It is not a description of everything that the Government must do but a programme of legislation. As the hon. Member for Cambridge eloquently pointed out, the Government do not need to legislate to make a difference. Most of the major issues affecting our country and economy do not require legislation. As shown by today&#8217;s welcome job numbers, which have improved in Worcester across the country, we can create jobs and grow the economy without new laws.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-16c.605.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40681" speakername="Albert Owen" colnum="605"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120516/debtext/120516-0002.htm#12051642001138">
	<p pid="c.605.1/1">I understand what has come from the Government Whips&#8212;I have seen copies of it, and it says that all the time; indeed, it has probably got into the psyche. However, let us look at proper economics. When we have low interest rates&#8212;and we have had historically low interest rates&#8212;it is during a recession. That is what happens; it is a natural phenomenon. Since January 2009, interest rates have been at an historic low. That did not start when this Government came in; it started in January 2009. Gilts and bonds are low as well, which gives us a golden opportunity to borrow at lower rates. That is how we got out of recessions in the past across the world. Pure austerity measures have never worked. People should look at economic history. Austerity is part of the package, but unless we get growth and jobs, we will not get out of the double-dip recession we are in.</p>
	<p pid="c.605.1/2">We sometimes get accused of being deficit deniers. I am neither a deficit denier nor a deficit extremist. It is extremism that gets us into trouble, and I have to say that there are many people in this House who are recession deniers&#8212;they are denying the fact that we are going down. Many people are paying the price, and that is why the cost of living is so important.</p>
	<p pid="c.605.1/3">Let me move on to energy and electricity market reform. I support reform in principle, although we do not know the details, so it would be a little naive to support it fully until it is implemented. I am a member of the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change, and we have looked at the principle of electricity market reform. We produced a report highlighting some of our concerns. There has been a White Paper for a long time, but we are only going to get pre-legislative scrutiny. We need to know what is in the Bill in order to deal with the issue properly and provide the certainty needed to invest in our infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="c.605.1/4">The Government have missed an opportunity in this Queen&#8217;s Speech. On one side, yes, there should be incentives for investment&#8212;that is very important&#8212;but there is very little protection for consumers. I have long argued in this House that Ofgem, the energy regulator, should have more teeth. It should be standing up. It is a damned cheek for the new Energy Secretary&#8212;whom I welcome to his place today&#8212;to try to claim some credit for the fact that energy companies are providing greater transparency in their bills. It is campaigns by the likes of Which? and Consumer Focus and so on that have</p>
	<p pid="c.605.1/5">highlighted the problems and embarrassed the energy companies, while the Government stood by and watched. Ofgem should have greater teeth. I make a plea to the Government to take that on board, because energy costs are hurting people, in peripheral areas in particular. Many are off the gas mains and off the grid. I want Ofgem, the regulator, to have the same powers to protect customers who are not on the gas mains as it enjoys in protecting those who are on the gas mains.</p>
	<p pid="c.605.1/6">Finally, let me move on to the subject transport. I welcome the concept of High Speed 2, but I want to see it up and running. The Transport Secretary is quoted as saying, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re preparing for legislation.&#8221; The legislation is vital, so can she give some indication of when it is likely to be introduced? We have done the consultation and the matter has been agreed by this House, although it is not popular with certain sections.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-16c.608.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="608"  time="015:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120516/debtext/120516-0002.htm#12051642001145">
	<p pid="c.608.1/1">I appreciate that intervention, because my point was that the problem was not necessarily the content but the presentation, and the perception of millions of people out there that the Government were interested only in the rich. I endorse the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point and hope that he will endorse my observation.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/2">Increasing the personal allowance to &#163;9,205 takes us within touching distance of the Liberal Democrats&#8217; No. 1 manifesto pledge to ensure that no one pays any tax on the first &#163;10,000 of earnings. I hope that that figure will be reached or, better still, raised even further in the next Budget. That would be good for the cost of living of those with limited financial means.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/3">For most people, the most significant cost is that of housing, whether it be a mortgage or rent. One does not have to be an economic wizard to know that the more of the family budget is spent on housing, the less will be available to be spent on all other aspects of the cost of living. If the rent or mortgage goes up there is less money to be spent, and that has an impact on the economy, particularly the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/4">I will concentrate my remarks on rent, because the subject of social housing&#8212;that is the current terminology, although I prefer the concept of democratically accountable council housing, given that successive post-war Labour and Conservative Governments strove to outdo each other in the building of hundreds of thousands of homes&#8212;has interested me throughout my political life, the 42nd consecutive year of which, in my home town, began this week.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/5">As a nation, we need to follow the excellent record of successive Labour and Conservative Governments in the 35 years or so that followed the second world war, and to put right the damage inflicted by successive Conservative and Labour Governments from around 1983 onwards. I look to the coalition Government to follow the lead of the Governments of Attlee and Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, Douglas-Home, Wilson and Heath, Callaghan, and Thatcher in her first Parliament. It is a startling fact that the Thatcher Government built more council houses for families than new Labour managed to build in 13 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/6">We need to build council houses today, on publicly available land. That would help to boost the economy, create jobs and provide decent homes for the hundreds of thousands of families living in accommodation that is not suitable for their needs. I am grateful to the National Housing Federation, whose East of England bulletin states:</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/7">&#8220;155,900 households are on social housing waiting lists in the East of England, one in 16 of all households in the region, and a 59% increase since 2000.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/8">Let me issue one caveat. We must not, in the process, sacrifice the special greenfield sites that provide a positive contribution to the quality of people&#8217;s lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/9">I merely ask that the coalition seek to follow the post-war consensus of politicians from all parties: people who had grown up in the terrible times of the 1920s and 1930s and who, in post-war Britain, knew that providing decent family homes would transform lives. Incidentally, I have no objection to the right to buy provided that each house sold is replaced by a new house, and I understand that that is the policy of the coalition. I invite Ministers to read the report of the housing debate that I led in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-11">11 June 2003</phrase>. Sadly, new Labour failed to take action, and I urge the coalition Government to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/10">I also invite Ministers to look at the Education Act 1944. On studying it, I realised that it was about more than just teaching, and that it adopted an holistic approach to the upbringing of children. It dealt with education, of course, but also with such matters as school health, dental checks and school meals. The architects of that Act recognised the importance of bringing everything together. If we are to succeed with a jigsaw, we need to fit the pieces for the corners and edges first, and the same applies to the jigsaw of life. If a decent home is provided for a family, the other pieces of the jigsaw of life are more likely to fall into place.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/11">All this has a bearing on the cost of living, because if people have a decent home at an affordable rent, they will have money to spend in local shops and on local services. It is not a cap on housing benefit but a cap on rents that we need. While building council houses is the mid to long-term solution, a cap on rents is the immediate requirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/12">The private sector and housing associations&#8212;the latter being dependent on public money&#8212;have not been able to fill the gap caused by the near-collapse of council house building under successive Governments over the past 30 years. Private landlords have made a killing and tenants have been given a worse deal at a much higher cost, much of it coming from the public purse. Public money is far better invested in public housing than lining the pockets of those who have become property millionaires courtesy of the publicly funded housing benefit regime. If a family&#8217;s housing benefit is cut, they have less money to spend on food, clothing, energy bills, local services and so on. The landlord still gets an inflated rent&#8212;or the family is forced to move. I call the latter economic cleansing. The local economy also has less money circulating because tenants spend more on rent and less on local purchases.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/13">At the weekend, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver and England footballer Steven Gerrard called for better knowledge of food nutrition to be made part of the national curriculum. However, before getting carried away with this good idea, I have concerns that the school meal service is not what it used to be, and I fear that Government policies are not helping the needs of many children. I urge Ministers not to damage the school meal service even more.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/14">I return to the good idea from Messrs Oliver and Gerrard. What would be even better is if first aid training also became part of the national curriculum, as I called for in a ten-minute rule Bill that I put to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-19">19 November 2003</phrase>. Both ideas should be incorporated. The case I made nine years ago is arguably even stronger today. By the way, earlier this month the all-party parliamentary group on first aid was formed, and I have the honour of being its first chairman.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/15">If every child in this country knew first aid and, over time, took this knowledge into adult life, the national health service would make huge savings. As I said when I introduced my Bill, it would</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/16">&#8220;save many hundreds of lives every year, produce annual savings to the national health service of hundreds of millions of pounds and result in a better quality of life for all age groups throughout the land.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-11-19.808"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 November 2003; Vol. 413, c. 808</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/17">It would lead to savings in people&#8217;s spending, because they would be more knowledgeable about what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. Today, an increasing number of children suffer from obesity, but I fear the prospect of a return to many children being under-nourished, because they are becoming the innocent victims of rises in the cost of living. Our Government must not allow this to happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.608.1/18">I shall support the coalition Government in the Lobby this evening and tomorrow, but I urge Ministers to look at what was achieved on the housing front by Governments between 1945 and the early 1980s, and seek to emulate them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-16c.610.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40521" speakername="Phil Wilson" colnum="610"  time="016:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120516/debtext/120516-0003.htm#12051642001146">
	<p pid="c.610.0/1">I want to address the transport rather than the energy aspect of today&#8217;s debate, and raise three issues that affect my constituency: the local airport, the big Hitachi investment, and the state of rural bus services not just in Sedgefield but throughout County Durham, including Darlington.</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/2">As local people know, Durham Tees Valley airport has gone through difficult times in the past few years, especially recently. Just three or four years ago, some 1 million passengers used the terminal. That figure has gone down significantly recently, but at an engagement at the airport a couple of weeks ago, it was good to see KLM making everybody aware of its ongoing commitment to the airport. Hopefully, at some point it will put some more routes on, or use the airport more often than it currently does.</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/3">I want to discuss the long-term sustainability of regional airports&#8212;I am pleased that the Aviation Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40169" name="Theresa Villiers">the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers)</phrase>, is in her place, and that she has agreed to a meeting next week&#8212;and air passenger duty. The latter is critical to the aviation industry in more ways than one, and to the passengers who have to pay it. It has gone up by twice the rate of inflation in the Budget. The aviation industry has told me that we need to look at regional variation of the APD. That does not mean varying it region by region, but having one rate for the south-east, where there is a lot of passenger congestion, and another for the rest of the country. Some would say, especially the Scottish National party, that we should devolve this matter to each of the devolved Administrations&#8212;Scotland and Wales, for example&#8212;but that is not the way forward. Devolving it to Scotland would impact on Durham Tees Valley airport and Newcastle airport. We need to gain the evidence for our approach. I am meeting a Treasury Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-18">18 June</phrase>, along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase>, to discuss this matter and try to get an evidence base pulled together, so that we can say that having regional variation in air passenger duty will work.</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/4">I also wish to discuss Hitachi, which I always mention when I can because it provides a massive boost to the north-east economy; it is providing the biggest private</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/5">sector investment in the north-east since Nissan. Hitachi is going to build a &#163;90 million factory&#8212;a train-building facility&#8212;in my constituency at Newton Aycliffe. The company is going to refurbish the rolling stock for the east coast main line and for the great western line into Wales. Hitachi is going to create 500 jobs, with thousands in the supply chain. This will be one of the most exciting industrial stories that we have in the north-east of England. I congratulate the Government on making the right decision on it and I pay tribute to the previous Labour Government, whose idea it was in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/6">The big issue I want to talk about, which is really affecting not only my area but all rural areas, is the state of rural bus services. The Sedgefield constituency covers about 150 square miles and contains about 30 to 40 towns and villages, some of which are very small. Brafferton, for example, has a population of only about 200, whereas Newton Aycliffe has a population of 20,000-odd. There is a lack of rural bus services and subsidies that have gone to local authorities have been cut. The subsidies are then withdrawn from bus companies such as Arriva, the big one in our area, and if they do not get the subsidies, the bus does not run. Sometimes that happens without the local people having been consulted, so they find that their bus does not turn up at their bus stop because the service has been pulled off the road and nobody has bothered to tell them.</p>
	<p pid="c.610.0/7">The situation is creating problems in the area. For example, people are having difficulty getting to work. We have actually had to write to the local jobcentre and the Employment Minister to say, &#8220;If someone cannot get to work any more and they pack in their job, what does that mean for their benefits? It is not their fault that they have had to resign their job, so will they still not get benefits for six months?&#8221; I have been told that this would be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but the local jobcentre has pointed out to me that it has actually considered buying bicycles to get people to work because of the state of the local bus services. It seems to me that we are going back not to Victorian times but to mediaeval times in respect of the state of transport in the area. A sophisticated society such as ours must be able to put on adequate bus services for people.</p>

	<p pid="c.614.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for clearing up some of the issues. There certainly are choices, but if grants and subsidies are being cut, the difficult decisions that have to be made are even harder. It is not just that the council has to take those difficult decisions, but that particular things have been thrust on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.614.2/2">The whole situation undermines the big society. There is a lot of hot air and a lot of big words, but what is actually happening is that people are suffering at the grass roots.</p>

	<p pid="c.618.0/1">I want to focus my remarks on the parts of the Queen&#8217;s Speech relating to rural affairs, particularly farming and the groceries code adjudicator, as mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40556" name="Laura Sandys">the Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.618.0/2">I hope that all of us, whatever our politics, would at least have been relieved and encouraged when we saw this morning&#8217;s unemployment figures, while not finding them the source of a desire to punch the air and celebrate. I guess that during the day most of us will have seen in our in-boxes reference to the unemployment levels in our own constituencies; we always look at those, as I did. I can claim pretty much no credit whatsoever for the fact that Westmorland and Lonsdale has the lowest unemployment in England. When we look at these stats and what they mean for the cost of living and for people&#8217;s ability to keep their heads above water, we see that nothing is more important than whether someone has a job and whether it pays well. The latter is equally important. The fact that we have very low unemployment in our part of the world is a credit to businesses and the public sector, both local and national, but it overlooks the fact that our local average income is less than &#163;20,000 a year while the average house price in Westmorland is &#163;240,000. That means that the average person is earning a twelfth of what it costs to buy a home. That is why we have so many people on the social housing waiting list and why so many people find it a struggle. If someone lives on my patch, the chances are that they are in work but that they are still struggling because the cost of living is a significant problem given the nature of what it is to live in a rural area.</p>
	<p pid="c.618.0/3">When we talk about the cost of living, it is worth reflecting on something that has changed drastically during the post-war period. In 1954, 33% of the average household budget was spent on food; today, that figure is about 11%. Of course, that progress is welcome, but it has not happened entirely for good reasons. It is good that food is less expensive these days&#8212;Members will be delighted to know that I do not claim credit for that either&#8212;but we need to remember that one of the reasons for that is the imbalance in the food market. We have a handful of very powerful retailers who do a good job; they do what any of us would do if we were given the freedom to do what the supermarkets are enabled to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.618.0/4">We have a handful of processors and many hundreds of suppliers. In such a market, as everyone knows, the powerful few are able to take advantage of the relatively powerless many. Let us be honest&#8212;the reason why food prices have been as they have over the decades has as much to do with exploitation as with progress.</p>

	<p pid="c.624.1/1">It was 46p when I bought it last weekend, but since the general election, the cost of the pint of milk that I buy for my milky coffee has gone up by 10%. Although that is not the world&#8217;s greatest economic indicator, all hon. Members can accept that it is a symptom of the huge increase in the cost of fuel, which puts pressure on families in all our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/2">I am a great supporter of the great British pint&#8212;I am sure some of my colleagues think that litres are a European abomination&#8212;but one thing that we buy in litres is fuel. The cost of fuel in my constituency is 6p or 7p a litre more expensive than in the neighbouring towns of Bury and Bolton. I became absolutely fed up of that, so I wrote to the major supermarkets to ask why there is such a difference. Apparently, for people who live in rural isolated areas such as Rossendale and Darwen, the local supermarket sets the cost of the fuel at the pump. Therefore, in a small geographical area that encompasses my constituency alone, the biggest retailer in my patch&#8212;the supermarket&#8212;sets the price and is the major supplier.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/3">People in my area say, &#8220;Welcome to rip-off Rossendale or dearest Darwen if you want fuel in your car.&#8221; That situation cannot be right. It is wrong that supermarkets behave in that way on fuel pricing. I can find out the price of a Tesco pint of milk or a can of beans by going on its website, but it is not prepared to set a tariff for fuel nationally and instead discriminates against rural and isolated areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/4">I support the Government&#8217;s idea of getting energy suppliers, particularly the utility companies, to write to their customers to offer them the lowest tariff, but supermarkets should offer petrol at the cheapest price to the young, hard-working families in my constituency&#8212;they might have to put diesel in a van to go to work or petrol in a small car to take children to school&#8212;and not at a price that they know they can get away with just because of location. The major supermarkets have had a monopoly&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40656" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, spoke extremely well on farming and the price of milk in that respect. Anti-competitive practices on fuel are pushing small, independent fuel retailers out of business, which is bad for businesses and for my area.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/5">That extra &#163;5 a week where I live to put fuel in a vehicle to go to work is the difference between people being able to turn the heating on or not, being able to feed their children healthy food or not, or being able to go out spend money in the economy or not. I hope fuel</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/6">price setting is part of the Government&#8217;s programme to look at the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/7">The cost of gas and electricity is another major issue raised by all our constituents. Those costs have ballooned beyond anyone&#8217;s increase in income over the past few years. They have risen by as much as 20%. We tell people to switch supplier. When people visit me in my patch, they say they will not switch supplier because they are nervous of bill shock. Uniquely, virtually, in a service industry supplying utilities to our houses, it is expected to be self-service. People are asked to read their own electricity meter. People in my advice surgeries have told me that they purposely underestimate how much electricity or gas they have used to help manage their cash flow. That builds up a huge legacy bill. Others simply have underestimations having had their meter readings underestimated over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="c.624.1/8">Those people are worried about switching, because they know that when they switch they will have to give an up-to-date meter reading and will have a huge legacy bill that they cannot pay. These people, sometimes those on the most expensive tariff, are unable to switch because they cannot pay their historical bill. That is why it is absolutely right that the Queen&#8217;s Speech sets out a programme to introduce smart metering. Bglobal, a successful business in my constituency, which I am delighted to see has retained its profitability, does business-to-business smart metering. There is an opportunity for us all to have smart meters in our homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.629.4/1">They certainly apply in such areas to some extent. I do not dissent from that proposition. However, the hon. Lady needs to know the direction in which I am going. Because our constituents&#8212;including hers&#8212;are so affected by this issue, it is an issue on which the Government should take what action it can take. We are debating the cost of living, and one of the principal costs for those who live in the rural areas in her constituency and in rural areas such as the ones that I represent is the cost of fuel. The Government have tackled that. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has scrapped &#163;4 billion in duty increases that were planned by the last Government. The Opposition do not like to</p>
	<p pid="c.629.4/2">hear this, but the truth is that the price of petrol at the pumps is 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been if the Labour party had won the last election.</p>
	<p pid="c.629.4/3">Is there more that could be done to deal with the cost of living? Of course, but Opposition Members also need to remember the huge debt bill&#8212;&#163;120 million a day&#8212;with which the country has been left. If we were not paying that bill, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the other Treasury Ministers would have far more scope to tackle this and other aspects of the cost of living. We have heard Opposition Members criticise the Government today, but they need to remember who was responsible for getting this country into the mess in which we find ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="c.640.0/1">Apart from half an hour when I nipped out to a meeting, I have sat through the entire debate. Two things have characterised</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/2">this debate. The first was at the beginning of the debate, when the two parties of government appeared to blame each other for what was happening. At times, it was like watching a Punch and Judy show.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/3">Putting that aside, the thing that has characterised the debate the most is that Members seem to be living in two completely different worlds. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" name="Sharon Hodgson">the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40387" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" name="Yvonne Fovargue">the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue)</phrase> spoke passionately about the impact of the Government&#8217;s policies and cuts on people in their communities&#8212;those who are living on the margins, families who are barely keeping their heads above water and even those who have gone under. I even recognised what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40507" name="Jake Berry">the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase> spoke about. From listening to other Members, it appears that while those parts of the country are slipping under, others are living in clover as a result of the Government&#8217;s policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/4">The Queen&#8217;s Speech was a lost opportunity. I would have liked the Government to have included some measures for growth, particularly in the construction industry. Those of us who have been around for a while know that in the past we have built our way out of recessions. Tax reliefs on construction and capital projects would have been a good place to start if the Government were serious about growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/5">I would have liked the Government to have announced investment in social housing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. In the north-east, 1,900 people are classified as homeless. The north-east is not a region that is usually associated with homelessness, but the combination of high unemployment and stagnant growth is forcing those at the bottom of our society out on to the streets. The Queen&#8217;s Speech contained nothing to help with that tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/6">There was nothing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to support families who are struggling to feed themselves and to heat their homes. The number of food banks in this country has risen from fewer than 10 in 2010 to more than 2,000. The number is growing daily as communities recognise what is happening in their midst and organise themselves to help the most vulnerable. I am involved with the Food4U food bank in my constituency. It is not the feckless or the workshy who are queuing up for food parcels, but decent families who have faced recent redundancies and who have to wait for up to six weeks for their unemployment claims to be processed, and the disabled who are appealing against employment and support allowance decisions and who face a wait of up to 13 weeks for their appeals to be processed. In the meantime, those families are left with nothing to live on, except what their neighbours and communities collect for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/7">Since 2010, the Government have shown themselves to be firmly on the side of vested interests. They have shown that in banking, the rail industry and the fuel industry. They stand firmly with the big six energy companies, the rail companies, banks and millionaires; not with the ordinary people of this country who are struggling to bring up their families and pay their bills. The Secretary of State said at the beginning of the debate that he is holding the big six to account, but he could not give us any details. Quite frankly, the secret deal with the big six is not fooling anybody. Instead of</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/8">supporting British industry, such as the solar industry in my constituency, the Government stand firmly on the side of vested interests and against the consumer. In the solar fiasco, the defence of the big six energy companies and their failure to tackle big bonuses in the water, communications and banking industries, the Government have shown again and again that they stand on the side of vested interests and against the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/9">I will make one final point because I want to leave time for other people. I want to give a message to the junior partner in the coalition Government. My constituents are desperately worried about their jobs and about how they will make ends meet. One constituent told me at the weekend that it costs him more to fill up his car than to pay his mortgage. People are worried about the cost of heating and fuel. Rail fares are rising. Despite the Government telling us that rail fares have gone up by only 1% above inflation, people tell me that their rail fares have gone up by 11%. People are worried about their public services. They see their libraries closing. They are frightened when they see the police on the streets, marching against 20% cuts in police budgets. They are worried about the impact of rising crime. They are worried about cuts in health and in school budgets. What they are not worried about is reform of the House of Lords. The House of Lords may be of interest to Liberal Democrats and political anoraks, but it is of no interest whatsoever to most of my constituents, who do not have the time to intellectualise about political reform because they are too busy worrying about how they are going to feed to the kids, put fuel in their cars and pay their bills.</p>
	<p pid="c.640.0/10">This Government are out of touch with ordinary people&#8217;s lives, they are firmly on the side of vested interests and they are at war with themselves. They need to go now, before they do any further damage.</p>
