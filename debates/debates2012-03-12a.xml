	<p pid="a.1.5/1">Under the last Government, council tax more than doubled. This Government are working with councils to freeze council tax for two years. A recent survey by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy indicates that council tax bills this April will go up by only 0.3%. I would have preferred that amount to be zero, but it is a real-terms reduction for hard-working families and pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.7/1">I would certainly be willing to take an away-day trip to York, if only to listen on the doorstep while a canvasser explains why getting an additional sum of &#163;294,000 justifies rejecting a &#163;1.8 million grant from the Government. This is clearly not in the interests of York; the council has not protected its council tax payers. I am afraid that, unlike the 300-odd authorities throughout the country that have taken the freeze, this council is going to find itself in a very difficult position.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.12/1">It is clear that there is significant scope for major savings in local authority procurement from the &#163;62 billion spent each year. By making these savings, we can enhance front-line services, save taxpayers&#8217; money and help to pay off the deficit. To encourage that, we are cutting red tape to open up procurement, especially to small and medium-sized firms. While it is up to a local area to decide from whom to procure, local authorities clearly have significant spending power, which should be used to help drive local growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">Leeds city council has the charter for procuring community benefits, which encourages all current or potential council suppliers to commit to providing added benefit to the local community, particularly in disadvantaged parts of the city. What action will the Minister take to encourage local authorities to take up schemes such as that seen in Leeds to encourage buyers to use local businesses? That would certainly benefit the towns and villages in my area and businesses in West Lancashire.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">The Government have supported the local productivity programme, which has been developed by the local government sector, led by the Local Government Association. We are looking at ways to improve access to tenders and procurement, especially for small and medium-sized firms, including promoting greater use of the online contract finder tool, which is a potential benefit for local British firms.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">The supply of phonic books for Her Majesty&#8217;s Government is a 95% monopoly of the Oxford University Press and Pearson between them.

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. To that end, the Government have been cutting unnecessary procurement red tape&#8212;for example, by removing the pre-qualification questionnaires for procurements below &#163;100,000, as I know those requirements have considerably discouraged small businesses from tendering. I hope that councils will follow that lead and will continue to look to other sizes of contracts to improve procurement.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/2">As I have said, we are working on a raft of schemes. We have introduced a new code of recommended practice on data transparency, we are introducing new checks and balances on procurement cards, we are working with the local government sector to encourage initiatives such as the Welland procurement unit in the east midlands, and our Spend Pro analysis can identify areas of comparative spend and areas for efficiencies and savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.4/1">The Government take the problem of unauthorised development very seriously. Strong powers already exist to enable local planning authorities to take action.

	<p pid="a.5.6/1">The new Localism Act makes five substantial changes. The first, and most obvious, is that it will no longer be possible to appeal an enforcement and make a retrospective planning application at the same time. Secondly, the issue of permission being granted when there has been concealment beyond the normal period will be addressed, so that, for instance, if somebody builds a bungalow behind a haystack, the fact that it has been there for longer than three years will make no difference in respect of enforcement. We will also be able to offer letters of comfort to landowners who are not involved in unauthorised action, and we are increasing penalties&#8212;and we are increasing penalties with regard to fly-posting and unauthorised advertising, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.4/1">In 2011, in terms of value, buy-to-let mortgages accounted for just 8% of total loans for home purchases. The biggest barrier to home ownership for many young people is not that, but the need to raise a deposit. That is why I know that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the NewBuy scheme, which we launched this morning.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.5/1">Obviously, I am aware that over the weekend the Government announced the home buy scheme for new build, which is a shadow of the sub-prime lending that went on previously, so I advise caution. The private rented sector, however, has added about 6% to the value of properties. Does the Minister agree that the issue is rising house prices and the cost of housing, not the availability of mortgages?</p>

	<p pid="a.9.6/1">Just to clarify one point, sub-prime lending happened when people who could not afford to pay a mortgage back were lent money, sometimes as much as 120% of the value of the property.

Private landlords often prefer to let them stand empty rather than let them to local families at lower rates than they have demanded from students.

	<p pid="a.11.1/1">The system for empty dwellings management orders remains in place and they can be brought into effect after two years, but there has been limited use of them so far. However, there are other incentives and penalties that we believe will be more effective more quickly. There is certainly an incentive on local authorities to work hard to bring empty homes into use because they will get a new homes bonus for that. If the consultation we are carrying out moves ahead in the right direction, the empty homes premium will be a strong incentive for home owners to bring their homes into use rather than paying that premium.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is of course referring to the very regrettable events in Kandahar on Sunday morning. We are all deeply shocked and saddened by the killing and wounding of Afghan civilians in Kandahar province. It was undoubtedly an appalling tragedy, and I know the House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the victims and their families. We support the investigation into the attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">The Secretary of State is currently overseas on official business but has regular contact with a number of Defence counterparts, including Secretary Panetta in the United States. The Secretary of State last spoke to the US Defence Secretary on Saturday about other matters, prior to this incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/3">At this tragic time, I can only echo the words of General Allen, commander of the international security assistance force, and inform the House that the attack</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/4">&#8220;in no way represents the values of ISAF and coalition troops or the abiding respect we feel for the Afghan people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/5">These have been a difficult few weeks in Afghanistan, with the Koran-burning, the tragic loss of six of our own soldiers in a Warrior and now this. I was able to see for myself the week before last the progress that we are making, and that the UK and ISAF remain resolute in our purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.3/1">As the Minister says, we are all deeply shocked and horrified by the news that an American soldier&#8212;a staff soldier, I believe&#8212;went out in the night and murdered 16 innocent civilians in cold blood. Is it the case that the murders were in fact carried out in the night, and that the victims were asleep in their beds? Of the casualties&#8212;the victims of this mass murder&#8212;will the Minister confirm that nine were children and three were women? It has been reported&#8212;perhaps the Minister has the latest information&#8212;that some of the children were no older than two or three years of age. Were the bodies burned by the murderer? Perhaps we could have information on that too.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2">Obviously, as the Minister has said, all hon. Members are deeply saddened and send our sympathy to the families of the victims. I accept entirely that this is not in any way the policy of the NATO forces and certainly not that of the United States. Nevertheless, as he said, this follows other incidents and tragedies in which civilians have been killed by US troops, and US troops have urinated on dead Afghans and burned the Koran. That was a despicable act in itself, but it also took the lives of other innocent people who were killed by the Taliban in revenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/3">Will the Minister accept&#8212;he mentioned the six brave British soldiers who died last week&#8212;that, overall, there is a growing feeling in this country, and no doubt in the United States, that this is an unwinnable war? People</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/4">certainly no longer accept the official line that our security depends on our military continuing its military role in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/5">President Obama and the Prime Minister meet this week. Would it not be wise for them to accept the strong feeling that this war has gone on for more than 10 years and is not winnable? Apart from the tragic incidents that we are referring to, the need is for the Afghans themselves to find a solution to their political and military problems. After 10 years, outside military intervention is much more the problem than the solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/6">I again make the point that so many people, including me&#8212;I do not know how many in the House of Commons feel the same, but I suppose I am not alone&#8212;simply no longer accept the official line, which I accept was also the previous Government&#8217;s official line, that our security depends on British troops fighting in Afghanistan. That will not help the fight against terrorism; it perhaps even helps the terrorists.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">In answer to some of the factual questions the hon. Gentleman asked at the beginning, ISAF has confirmed that 13 Afghan citizens were killed in the attack. However, open source reports indicate that up to 16 may have been killed. As he said, I understand that nine children were killed in the attack. I have no further information on the age of those children. It is understood that a further five civilians were wounded and are being treated in the military hospital at Kandahar.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/2">On the broader points that the hon. Gentleman makes, at the Lisbon summit ISAF drew up a time scale for the remainder of the combat operation in Afghanistan, which was reconfirmed at the NATO ministerial meeting two weeks ago. I believe that that is a realistic timetable for the remainder of our operation in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/3">The progress that is being made in building up the Afghan national security forces is impressive&#8212;not only in scale but in their competence. They are developing a culture of leadership and planning more of the operations in which they are involved. The process of transition from ISAF security lead to ANSF security lead is progressing well so far. I believe, therefore, that we are on the right course and have the right security strategy. I think what the hon. Gentleman is getting at, though, is the widely held view that we need to find a political solution to the future of Afghanistan. Although progress on that has been disappointingly slow, there are now encouraging signs, and there is a realistic prospect that a political process will be under way within the time scale I am talking about.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.1/1">These are devastating events for the victims and their families which may well have long-term implications for ISAF between now and 2014. Does my hon. Friend accept that these events remind us of the fact that we ask our young men and women to deploy to circumstances that are difficult, dangerous and stressful? In our recruitment, we lay great stress on physical attributes, but is he satisfied that we are equally searching when it comes to the psychological component of recruitment? If not, is it not time for a review?</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right to say that we demand exacting standards from our new military recruits, and they certainly have to</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">pass physical tests, among others. We are always on the lookout for signs of people suffering psychological stress&#8212;that occurs at every point&#8212;and considerable progress has been made in recent years on removing some of the stigma that attaches to anybody in those very exacting circumstances suffering from the effects of stress. There should never be any shame attached to that. We are making progress in identifying it, in extending a sympathetic arm to those suffering from stress and in improving the long-term assistance given to them when they return to the UK, because the sorts of incidents that some of them will have witnessed will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">The killing of 16 innocent civilians in Afghanistan yesterday was an appalling act, and I join the Minister in rightly sending our thoughts to the families of the victims of this incident. The information we have so far is that it was the act of an isolated individual outside the chain of command, and it is important that we do not draw any wider conclusions about the conduct of US or other ISAF forces, who act with unparalleled bravery and professionalism in the conduct of their mission in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">We have all heard the warnings from the Taliban of reprisal attacks on coalition forces. In the light of that, may I ask the Minister what assessment the Government have made of the increased threat posed to UK armed forces and civilian personnel working in Afghanistan? Have any operational changes been made&#8212;notably on ending the use of night raids&#8212;and has additional security been put in place to protect diplomatic and civilian staff working on behalf of the UK Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3">The influence of ISAF forces in stabilising Afghanistan depends on the trust of the Afghan people. This act has clearly put that trust, carefully built over the past 10 years, in jeopardy. Will the Minister say what discussions the Government have had with ISAF counterparts on measures that can be put in place to build trust in the light of this appalling incident? The post-2014 planning will determine the success of our mission in Afghanistan, so will he say a little more about what early assessment ISAF has made of the impact of these events on negotiations over ISAF&#8217;s presence post 2014?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">Although the tragedy is undoubtedly a blow to the ISAF mission, what about the UK&#8217;s mission and British public opinion? Will the Minister tell the country more clearly what the UK&#8217;s long-term commitment to Afghanistan will be and what type of nation he expects to leave when the draw-down takes place post 2014?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/5">We have always approached the issue of Afghanistan from a bipartisan standpoint, which it is important to do while we have our forces in harm&#8217;s way there. We welcome the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment to raise the issue of Afghanistan at his meeting in Washington with President Obama this week, and we look forward to seeing greater details of the plans for post 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.1/1">It is important to stress that there is a US and Afghan investigation now under way into exactly what happened. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this would appear to be the action of one isolated individual, completely outwith the control of the chain of command, and he is also absolutely right that it is in no way indicative of the behaviour of the rest of the ISAF forces who are there.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asked me about force protection. We were already operating on an enhanced set-up for force protection in the light of the Koran-burning incident; following this incident, vigilance will be even greater, and at a local level, commanders on the ground will be making whatever sensible arrangements they think are necessary. Operations in the night are increasingly led by Afghan forces, and I think this is likely to be the case even more so in the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">The hon. Gentleman quite rightly raised the issue of trust. It is absolutely essential to what we are doing that there is trust between the international forces, and the Afghan authorities and the Afghan people. There is no doubt whatever that that trust will have been tested severely by the incidents of the last few weeks. Of course, this is not one-way traffic, because we have seen incidents where both British and French troops have been killed by Afghan troops they were mentoring. These are delicate relationships, but I was impressed when I was there two weeks ago that the commander of ISAF took this aspect of his work extremely seriously and had been very quick to get on the front foot and go to President Karzai and the Afghan authorities to apologise and make clear the profound regret that he and the west felt for the incidents that have happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">As for the post-2014 situation, it is important that everybody understands&#8212;both in the west and in Afghanistan&#8212;that the end of western troops being in Afghanistan in a combat role does not mean the international community walking away from Afghanistan. It is certainly the case that we will continue to have troops stationed in Afghanistan, providing training and mentoring for Afghan troops. Specifically, we have made a commitment, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, to take the lead internationally in running the officer training programme from 2013 onwards. However, as we begin and continue the process of transition, we expect to see a greater number of international partners coming in and helping Afghanistan to build up, in terms of both aid and, increasingly, ordinary trade and economics. We cannot allow the setbacks of the last few weeks to put us off that overall objective, which in my view, notwithstanding all the pressures, remains on course.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">We have got two years and about nine months left of combat operations in Afghanistan, and we have lost 404 soldiers so far. The idea that we can start challenging the plan to withdraw early worries me a great deal, because soldiers need certainty. It is needed for the officers to plan and for the soldiers to get used to it. It is going to be increasingly challenging for our soldiers over the next two years, as we move towards withdrawing from combat operations. Does the Minister agree with that assessment? We have got to support our soldiers utterly and completely. The plan is set and must now remain set.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">Let me assure my hon. Friend that the internationally agreed plan remains firmly in place. It was reiterated two weeks ago at the NATO ministerial conference. It is important for all those who are engaged in the operations in Afghanistan to understand that the plan remains in place and that there is no question whatever of our cutting and running early because of these events or any others. Two out of five phases of</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">transition&#8212;area by area, district by district&#8212;have so far taken place, and both appear broadly to have gone off very well. The three remaining phases will take us through this year and into next year. Within the time frame between now and 2014, the nature of the work that our troops are doing will increasingly shift to a supportive role, but they will still be there bearing arms until the end of 2014. It is important, particularly for those who grieve for the losses that we have suffered, that they should not believe that those losses have been in vain. We are not going to give up; we are going to see this through and finish the job off according to the internationally agreed plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">May I return the Minister to the question of a political strategy, which he rightly says is the key to ending any insurgency? The Defence Secretary wrote in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> last week that a political strategy could not succeed until the Afghan Government had established a position of strength. May I put it to the Minister that the difficulty with that is that the Afghan Government are seen by many Afghans as a significant part of the problem, and that the search for a position of strength defies the logic of a counter-insurgency, which is that one can achieve tactical advances in one part of a country while the insurgency strikes back elsewhere? Does he acknowledge that the best approach would be for the international community to appoint an international mediator with United Nations Security Council backing who could talk to those on all sides and frame the political strategy, both internal and regional, that is so desperately needed? Does he also acknowledge that, if we do not start working on that now, every day that passes will weaken the chances of establishing a stable Afghanistan that we can leave?</p>

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s stress on the need for a political solution. During his time as Foreign Secretary, he did his best to promote such processes, but unfortunately he did not meet with a great deal of appetite elsewhere for getting them under way. Frankly, it has remained pretty tough going until relatively recently. Thankfully, some of the key stakeholders now seem to be showing a greater appetite for sitting down and participating in a political process. The Afghan Government are certainly more willing to do so than they have been in the past, and it looks as though the Pakistan Government might also be more willing to engage in such a process. The proposal to open a Taliban office in Qatar has served as a catalyst to focus people&#8217;s minds. The right hon. Gentleman was paraphrasing the Defence Secretary slightly; I do not think a political process has to await a situation in which the Afghan Government achieve a position of strength. Applying military pressure to the Taliban has probably made it more likely that they will be willing to sit down and join a political process, but any such process must be inclusive of all the elements in Afghanistan who need to buy into a long-term settlement, as well as all the elements in the region who will be vital to the delivery of peace on the ground in the years to come. We are a long way from achieving that, but progress is at last being made.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">I thought you might pick me for that, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">The Afghan Government and the Afghan people are rightly outraged by this atrocity, but does the Minister agree that the one bunch of people who have no right to promise revenge are the Taliban? It was their hosting of an international terrorist organisation that murdered thousands of men, women and children that led to the invasion of Afghanistan in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.3/1">Two years and nine months is half the length of the second world war, and a plan that cannot be changed in the light of circumstances is barely worth the paper it is written on. The Minister has a hard job, and we are not here to criticise, but these incidents and atrocities are typical of the end of an occupation or a conflict. We cannot justify British soldiers dying between now and withdrawal. Does the Minister agree that we should honour the sacrifice of our men by ensuring that no more are sacrificed?</p>

	<p pid="a.28.4/1">Nobody has said that we are adhering to a plan that cannot be changed. The point I have been at pains to make is that the plan has not been changed as yet. Of course we follow closely, as do the ISAF commanders, the situation on the ground. The plans will reflect the realities as we go forward. This is a process of transition. I said that we have gone through two of the five phases of transition&#8212;and it is broadly working. I have to say that the rate of casualties on our side has come down markedly. I simply do not think that the right hon. Gentleman is right: if we were to pack up and leave now, it would make a mockery of everything that has been done to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">History has a way of repeating itself. Not only did six British soldiers die last week within miles of where 1,000 perished in 1880, but the garrison of Kandahar in the same year also carried out a series of isolated unpleasantnesses against the civilian population. Armies reflect society. Regrettably, we have to expect more of these sorts of isolated instances. Will the Minister therefore comment on the rumour that this incident is related to alcohol&#8212;exactly as it was with the incidents in 1880&#8212;and on what is being done in respect of our Muslim allies and on how we will control the consumption of alcohol among allied troops?</p>

	<p pid="a.28.6/1">The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting historical points, but asks me specifically whether we know of any connection between this incident and alcohol. I know of absolutely no such connection. It is, of course, the case that our forces in Afghanistan operate entirely dry; alcohol is not provided for them. I have no knowledge of alcohol having anything at all to do with this appalling incident.</p>

He is absolutely right that there is no need to await an investigation of exactly what happened before we begin to repair relations with those communities as far as we possibly can and to offer every possible support to the families and those grieving in the wake of this appalling incident. It is certainly the case that we will urge our allies to crack on and do that.</p>

I can assure him, however, that the temperature is read constantly and that progress is assessed all the time.

Many challenges will face us between now and then if we are to achieve what remains an ambitious target, but that is what success would look like, and that is the strategic goal in security terms towards which we are working. However, I repeat the point made by the former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">It is important for us to retain an international view. The ISAF strategy is one that we have drawn up together, so expressions of support from the German Government are of course very welcome. Essentially, the conclusion that was reached at the Lisbon conference was that we had gone in together and should come out together. That is what I mean when I say that we will agree with our ISAF partners exactly what the strategy and the timelines should be, and that we will act together according to our collective judgment of the progress that we are making.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.3/1">I do not think that the lesson to be drawn from this is that we should speed up a process which is moving as fast as it possibly can already. The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that the Afghan national security forces are being grown from a cold start. I think that the progress they have made is remarkable: they have grown in number, but, far more impressively, they have grown in competence, in their quality of leadership, and in their ability to plan and execute operations. I think that hurrying the process at this stage, or passing the baton to them prematurely, would undermine all the progress that has been made. We are pushing the process of handover as fast as we possibly can, and if we were to cut and run now, we would risk undoing the progress that we have made.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.4/1">I echo what has been said about the improvements to the Afghan national army. We should not forget that that is due not just to British forces, but to the American forces who have trained them. We should also not forget that this was an isolated incident, and that more than 2,000 Americans have been killed. There will be some who call for urgent withdrawal, but I stress what has already been said by Members on both sides of the House. This is not just about security; it is also about governance, and I hope that that will be discussed at the forthcoming summit in Chicago.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The Chicago summit will provide an opportunity for the international community to make long-term commitments both to the future security of Afghanistan after the combat role has ended and to its future prosperity. We will look to countries around the world&#8212;countries that have been involved in ISAF, but also many others that have not&#8212;to come forward and</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">make commitments to Afghanistan&#8217;s long-term future.

	<p pid="a.31.0/1">Apart from the horror of the latest incidents, by which we have all been rightly shocked, a number of other issues have been raised during these exchanges about the conduct of our combat mission during the remaining period in which we will deploy a combat role in Afghanistan. They are difficult issues, and I wonder whether it would be sensible for the House to have the opportunity to take part in a full and serious debate on the conduct of our mission.

Every time I visit Afghanistan, I am struck by the extraordinarily thoughtful way in which our troops go about their operations. If one has any sort of discussion with them, particularly with officers who plan and execute operations, one finds that there is nothing remotely gung-ho about what they do; it is all extremely thoughtful and it is always conducted with a keen appreciation of the legal and moral framework in which they operate.</p>

Over the weekend, I met the parents of Corporal Jake Hartley and the grandparents of Private Anthony Frampton&#8212;Private Danny Wilford was the third of my constituents. Many other constituents have legitimately been asking me this weekend why we do not just withdraw now, so that there are no more young losses. However, after their deaths and those of their colleagues from the Yorkshire Regiment and the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s Regiment, and after these horrific killings of innocent civilians, it is important that we do not let their deaths be in vain and that we withdraw in an orderly and calm way, as we had planned with ISAF forces.</p>

It is right that, after we have had casualties of our own, we grieve and acknowledge the sacrifice that has been made, but of course the reason why we have had this question this afternoon is to recognise also that the Afghan civilian population is making a terrible sacrifice. Our thoughts and our prayers remain with those Afghan villages and the families there, who have been on the wrong end of an appalling tragedy, which I know we all profoundly regret.</p>

We expect the Procedure Committee&#8217;s conclusions to be of great value, as they have been on a number of other topics. I want to emphasise that today&#8217;s motion is not intended to pre-empt the review&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Well, it simply does not. It makes three changes that need to be made this Session in order to take effect before the next elections for members of the Backbench Business Committee and therefore before the completion of the review. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, those changes arise in part from points made in evidence to the Procedure Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the 2010 elections and that Committee itself envisaged changes as regards minority parties being made in advance of the review.</p>

As a member of the Procedure Committee, I thought I would raise the notion that the question of whether the Committee should be elected on a party basis is a difficult matter that I shall be considering very carefully during the forthcoming proceedings of the Procedure Committee.

	<p pid="a.36.3/1">I am sorry to hear that, obviously, but it is for the House to make that decision in the light of today&#8217;s debate. There would be very little point in our determining that we should have made a change to the process of election after the elections had been held for the next Session. It seems appropriate to me that the House should have the opportunity, as it does today, to consider the matter and come to a conclusion.

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I think I should make a little more progress as I have yet to explain what the proposal is, but I will come back to right hon. and hon. Members who wish to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">The motion aligns the method of election to the Backbench Business Committee with that for other Select Committees. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> might feel aggrieved that he does not have representation on all the Select Committees of the House, but he does not because, on the basis of the formula, he does not have enough party members in the House to have that level of representation. The motion provides protection against unwarranted interference by a future Government in the election of the Chair&#8212;something that some hon. Members were very concerned about. We propose to give the House an opportunity to determine that issue today. The motion provides also for participation by the minority parties, however ungrateful they may be, in the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">Nearly a month ago, the Government&#8217;s response to the Procedure Committee&#8217;s report was published. It stated quite explicitly that</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">&#8220;the Government believe that it would be appropriate for the House to address the anomaly whereby members of the Backbench Business Committee other than the Chair (unlike those of other select committees) are elected by the House as a whole rather than by Members of the political party to which they belong before the next elections of members. The Government propose to allow time for consideration of proposals to this effect towards the end of the current Session.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.38.4/1">I shall make a little more progress. I have been reasonably generous in giving way to hon. Members, and I will no doubt be sufficiently generous again.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/2">The Government could not have been clearer about their intentions. There has been some suggestion that the motion has been sprung on the House without notice or at the wrong time. I suggest that that contention is without merit.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/3">When moving the motion which led to the establishment of the Backbench Business Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-15">15 June 2010</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House pointed out that</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/4">&#8220;For the first time in over a century, the House will be given control over significant parts of its own agenda.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-06-15.779"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 June 2010; Vol. 511, c. 779</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/5">That shift in control is one which this Government facilitated and to which they remain fully committed. The subjects of debate and the form that motions for</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/6">debate take on the equivalent of 35 days a Session, including at least 27 days on the Floor of the House, are now properly a matter for the Backbench Business Committee. The debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee have helped to raise the public profile of the House of Commons, and increased public awareness of the crucial role of the House in holding the Executive to account. The subjects chosen might well not have been chosen by the Government, or indeed by the Opposition, and have been challenging for us. That is part and parcel of the switch of power that the Wright Committee envisaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/7">The Government are committed to the continuing role of the Backbench Business Committee, and to providing the time to that Committee in a Session of normal length which is set out in Standing Orders. The motion before us today does not affect in any way the Committee&#8217;s powers or its role.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/8">The first change addresses an anomaly in the method of election of members of the Backbench Business Committee. At present, all members of the Committee are elected by the whole House. This is wholly appropriate for the Chair of the Committee, who represents the whole House, but it may not be appropriate for the other members. It is wrong in principle that, for example, the choice of Opposition Members on a Committee could be decided by the votes of Members on the Government Benches, who will inevitably outnumber them.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.4/9">I read a comment in the electronic media earlier today&#8212;because of the anomaly, why do we not change the rules for all the other Select Committees to match those for the Backbench Business Committee? The reason is obvious. If we were to do that, the Government of the day would control who the Opposition parties put on Select Committees. The House would rightly be outraged if that were the position, yet that is the position that we currently have with the Backbench Business Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">No doubt my hon. Friend has seen the evidence submitted by Dr Meg Russell to the Procedure Committee, in which she expressed her view that to go down the route he has chosen</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">&#8220;would be very much contrary to the spirit of what the Wright Committee intended.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/3">Is not the answer that the Backbench Business Committee is a special committee, not like an ordinary Select Committee, and that its Chair should be selected in the same manner as the Speaker and represent the whole House, as indeed should its members? That is what Wright intended. Why is he departing from Wright?</p>

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">As I said when responding to the debate on the original motion to set up the Backbench Business Committee, Wright is not holy writ and should not be treated as such, not least because there are internal contradictions in the Wright report, just as there are sometimes in holy writ. Therefore, the House has to take</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/2">a view on what is in the best interests of its procedures. That will be for the House to decide. I simply contend that it is a strange situation where the biggest party represented in the House can override the interests and decisions of other parties in deciding who its representatives on the Committee will be. I would have thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex had confidence in the ability of his own party&#8217;s procedures &#8212;I am afraid I have no specialist knowledge of them&#8212;to make a proper determination of who should serve on the Committee on its behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/3">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex that different considerations apply to the Chair of the Committee, as he set out, which is why we propose that the Chair should continue to be elected by the whole House, with one proviso: we think that the Government should not provide the Chair, for perfectly obvious reasons. The situation is exactly analogous to that of two other Committees&#8212;the Standards and Privileges Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. There is a strong argument in favour of the Committee&#8217;s decisions not being seen as the result of some sort of internal collusion between the Government and the legislature, and I think that the clearest way of indicating that they are not is to ensure that the Chair comes from a party that is not represented in Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">So, the Deputy Leader of the House can of course give us an assurance that the Government are not seeking to change the rules now because existing members of the Committee have proved too independent.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" speakername="David Heath" colnum="40"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0001.htm#12031215000695">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">I can give that clear assurance, because I have absolute confidence that the members elected by the party groups will be every bit as independent as those elected by Committee of the whole House, and perhaps even identical in person. What I am trying to do is prevent the potential abuse of that process, which could clearly happen under the present rules. I hope that each of the parties, through their internal mechanisms, will have sufficiently robust structures in place to ensure that the Whips, if they come running to Back-Bench Members to have a particular Member elected to the Committee, will be robustly told where to go. But we shall see, because that is internal to the various parties and their internal democratic processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">I am struggling a little to follow the argument the Deputy Leader of the House is making. If it is the case that the present Chair and members of the Committee have been conducting themselves excellently, why change now in a hurry when we are still waiting for a report? If the Government are so concerned about this&#8212;perhaps there is a point I have overlooked&#8212;why did he not bring in the arrangement he is proposing at the beginning of the process? Why are we bringing it in when the process is well underway, given that the people who have been running the Backbench Business Committee appear to be doing such a splendid job?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">I have already said why. We are doing that now because we are about to have elections, and we do not change the rules of elections after elections. It is normal practice, and normally more constructive, to change the rules before elections, rather than afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/2">The hon. Gentleman asks why we did not start from a different basis. I accept, and the House is fully aware, that we started with the draft proposals from the Wright Committee, and it was obvious then that what applied to the Backbench Business Committee was different from what applied to any other Select Committee. The precautionary principle in elections to other Select Committees exists for a reason: to stop interference&#8212;in a party political way, between the parties&#8212;as to who on Select Committees should represent Members. I think that is quite an important principle, but the House must decide whether it considers it to be an important principle. If the House considers it to be nugatory, the House will vote accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">I realise that my hon.

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a separate issue, one that we explored at length when we set up the Committee. The answer is that the Committee is a Committee of the House which deals with the topical issues before it, and it is right that Back Benchers have a regular opportunity to express their view on its performance; I make no apologies for that. It is sensible that the House has such control, because if we were to elect the Committee&#8217;s members for an entire Parliament, the House would lose that opportunity to reflect on, or to see, whether the Committee was conducting itself as the House had hoped.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">That is entirely different in kind from the responsibilities, within a Select Committee, of Select Committee members, who need such continuity in order to do their job effectively of holding to account the Department in question. To my mind there is a clear separation, but the hon. Gentleman may take a different view. I am simply confident that the House is capable of making decisions about the way in which it conducts its affairs, and of doing so without the benefit of distortions of any kind in the system. That is what is proposed today.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.5/1">The hon. Gentleman says that I have singularly failed to answer the question, but I have answered it several times; he simply does not like the answer I have given. There is a subtle distinction between not answering and others not accepting the answer. As I have said, the answer is that this is the opportunity we have before the elections.</p>

It is no good crying after the event if it proves that we have made an error in our election of Members to the Backbench Business Committee.

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">On that point, the problem so far in getting Procedure Committee debates on to the Floor of the House has been the Government allocating time for the Backbench Business Committee so that the Committee can allocate time to debate a Procedure Committee report.

	<p pid="a.42.3/1">There is one small difficulty with that, which is that the Backbench Business Committee is precluded from putting forward time for amendments to its own constitution. That is why it has to be a matter for the Government and why we are providing time today, and would provide time in future, to consider the results of the Procedure Committee report.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/2">The motion achieves what I have been describing by a simple endorsement of the principle that parties should elect members of the Backbench Business Committee each Session, and thereafter when a vacancy arises, in a secret ballot of all Members from that party by whichever transparent and democratic method they choose, following the same approach as that agreed for other Select Committees on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-04">4 March 2010</phrase>. In consequence, we are, if the House agrees, removing the provisions in Standing Orders for elections of members of the Committee other than the Chair. The amendments in the name of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> and others would remove the provisions whose purpose I have described and retain the current arrangements. Given what I have said, it will be no surprise that I will not support those amendments, but it is open to the House to do so if it wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/3">The second element of the motion relates to the Chair of the Committee, and I have already indicated why I believe that it introduces a beneficial change. The Government believe that it would not be appropriate for a Member from the governing party, or parties, to be nominated for the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, because to do so might give rise to the Government&#8217;s appearing to seek to influence a key position in the House in an improper way. Having an Opposition Member chairing the Backbench Business Committee headlines the Committee&#8217;s independence not only from the business managers&#8212;of whom I am one, on behalf of the Government&#8212;but the influence of the Government party generally. My right hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40516" name="Alan Haselhurst">the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst)</phrase> stood for the post of Chair in 2010, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> was elected, and his wisdom and experience have subsequently been deployed in his service as Chair of the Administration Committee. However, conventions evolve over time, and we think the time is now right to recognise that the Chair should be held by an Opposition Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/5">At the same time, we are taking the opportunity to remedy an anomaly in the Standing Order that was identified by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" name="Jo Swinson">the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> and referred to by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire during the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-15">15 June 2010</phrase>&#8212;namely, that at present no Member can be nominated for the Chair unless he or she belongs to a party with at least 11 Members of this House. I acknowledged on that occasion that my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman had identified a possible defect in the Standing Order that needed to be considered, and I am pleased to move this motion to remedy it&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption</i> <i>]</i>&#8212;despite the protestations of the hon. Gentleman who, it seems, is never satisfied. We propose to replace it with a provision that requires cross-party support of comparable strength but allows Members from minority parties to stand for Chair of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/6">Finally, the motion makes provision for hon. Members from parties not represented on the Backbench Business Committee to participate in its work. The motion allows the Committee to invite an hon. Member who does not belong to a party represented on it to participate in its proceedings, including deliberative sessions, but not to vote. It would be for the Committee to decide whether to invite one hon. Member for a Session or a shorter period or to invite different hon. Members to different meetings. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Government believe that this effectively addresses minority party concerns&#8212;although clearly, according to the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire, it does not&#8212;in a manner consistent with the principle that the composition of the Committee should reflect the party composition of the House. The hon. Gentleman protests from a sedentary position that it does not reflect it because he wants full membership of the Committee, but that is not the way in which this House has determined its membership of Select Committees, whereby such membership reflects the composition of the House as a whole. It seems to me that that principle of proportionality is something that the House would wish to maintain, because otherwise it becomes open to the House to distort the composition of the House as represented in the membership of its Select Committees, and I am not sure that the Backbench Business Committee should be separate from that consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/7">We made it clear in our response to the Procedure Committee, which was published last month, that we do not agree with the proposal for full membership for a minority party Member. Our proposal allows for the participation of hon. Members from different parties, as and when the Backbench Business Committee considers it appropriate, whereas the amendments would provide for only a single hon. Member to participate. That is why we oppose the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/8">The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40088" name="John Hemming">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase> would apply the principle of whole-House elections to the election of a minority party Member. That is instructive about the conduct of this whole debate. Were the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire and the amendments to them tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley successful, the larger parties in the House would determine not only which Member from the minority parties would appear on the Committee, but which party would be represented. That would put the larger parties in the inappropriate position of deciding whether it should be a Member from the Democratic Unionist party, the Scottish National party or Plaid Cymru who was selected for the position. That amply demonstrates what is wrong with the current system of elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.3/9">In conclusion, the motion will change the elections for the membership of the Backbench Business Committee and how Members participate in its work in a way that enables the Committee to continue to work effectively. It will make those changes at the right time&#8212;in fact, the only possible time&#8212;before the membership is settled in the next Session. The motion will facilitate the Committee&#8217;s effective operation in the future and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.0/1">It is appropriate that I start my comments, which I promise will be brief, by drawing attention to the success of the Backbench Business Committee so far. That needs to be put on the record. A wide range of topics has been introduced to the House via this mechanism, some of them as a result of the e-petitions process, with which we are now all familiar. Of course, one particular subject was not allowed to be debated in the Chamber and the reasons for that are well known.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/2">There have been 39 days of Back-Bench debate in the Chamber and 16 in Westminster Hall. The impact has been considerable and has outweighed the number of days that have been allocated. There have been challenging debates on a range of issues and there have been six votes, including two on Afghanistan, one on contaminated blood, one on the regulation of financial advisers and one on accountability to the House. All those are important topics that would not have been debated or voted on if we had not had the Backbench Business Committee. The House would therefore not have been able to express its view.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/3">One of the two most memorable debates was last year&#8217;s debate on wild animals in circuses. The decision of the House, without a vote, was that wild animals should be banned in circuses. The view of the Opposition is that the wild animals in circuses may die of old age before they are banned if the Government have their way.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/4">Perhaps the biggest and most profound debate was on the Hillsborough disaster, which was held in the House last autumn. I was proud to take part in that debate, and in my view, it showed the House at its finest. It was a moving debate that consolidated the growing view that the Hillsborough disaster requires open and transparent examination, especially in relation to the records that are given over to the inquiry, and that no stone should be left unturned in revealing the truth</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/5">of what happened on that day. The House played an important part in confirming the view of the establishment, if one wants to call it that, on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/6">The Backbench Business Committee is clearly a useful new mechanism for strengthening the effective scrutiny of Government by the Commons. We support the motion because it follows the example set by the new arrangements for Select Committee membership, which were hard fought for. Those arrangements determine that the membership of Select Committees should be decided by elections of all Members of the House. The new Select Committee procedure, which will apply to the Backbench Business Committee if the motion is passed, gives Back Benchers on both sides of the House the opportunity to determine their own representation on Committees. Equally importantly, it allows them to do so without interference by any other party.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.0/1">The hon. Lady says that the motion will give parties on both sides of the House the ability to select their Committee members without interference by anybody else. In fact, it will give three parties in the House the ability to select their members. It ignores the representatives of the other six parties. The Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National party, the Alliance party, the Green party and the Democratic Unionist party will have no ability to select members. Does she not think that she should have thought the matter through a little more carefully, or is this just about the Labour party Whips controlling their Members, in the same way as it is about the Tory Back Benchers being controlled by their Whips?</p>

	<p pid="a.46.3/1">I rise to speak against the motion, largely in sadness and regret, because I will have to criticise those on the Government Front Bench, particularly the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House. I could do that in 10 seconds, because as we have already heard, Government and Opposition Front Benchers support the motion on the Backbench Business Committee, so we could almost say, &#8220;When the two Front Benches agree, it&#8217;s a clearly a stitch-up and can't be right for the House&#8221;&#8212;and sit down.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/2">This attempt to alter Standing Orders on the Backbench Business Committee to suit the Executive is absolutely outrageous. It is an attempt by the Executive to ignore Parliament and to impose their will on the House. What is particularly shocking is that they are trying to interfere with business that is exclusively Back-Bench business. Such business has no relevance whatever to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/3">The Government&#8217;s actions fly in the face of the House of Commons Reform Committee report, &#8220;Rebuilding the House&#8221;, HC1117, which proposed what are known throughout the House as the Wright reforms. Those reforms were designed to restore trust in Parliament and to reduce the power of the Executive. They were the very reforms that the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House supported so vigorously when they were in opposition. I am sad to say that it has taken less than two years for the Government to do a U-turn and go back to the bad old days of the Executive trying to tell Parliament what to do. There have been several signs over the past few months that the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/4">are adopting the policy of always knowing right and of assuming that Parliament is there only to rubber-stamp their decisions. This motion is the clearest and most obvious breach of their commitment to put Parliament first.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/5">One of the most shocking and shameful aspects of the debate is its timing. The Leader of the House put the motion on the Order Paper without any consultation with the Backbench Business Committee. Even more significantly, he did so only hours after the Committee met, so that it could not formally consider the issue. He has also tabled the debate and vote prior to tomorrow&#8217;s Committee meeting. He has deliberately slighted the Committee, which meets weekly, by putting the motion on the Order Paper hours after last Tuesday&#8217;s meeting and before tomorrow&#8217;s meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/6">What is even more reprehensible is that the Committee is reviewing its operation so that it can report to the House and provide evidence to the Procedure Committee&#8217;s inquiry. The Government&#8217;s timing is the most disgraceful discourtesy to the Backbench Business Committee. The Leader of the House is saying to the Committee: &#8220;I want to sneak this through before your Committee can formally protest.&#8221; That is devious, undemocratic and a disgrace to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/7">I shall now turn to the crux of the matter&#8212;this is why the motion should be defeated. The Procedure Committee, chaired so ably by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40234" name="Greg Knight">the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr Knight)</phrase>, who is in his place, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-21">21 February 2012</phrase> that it was launching a review of the operation of the Backbench Business Committee in accordance with a previous motion agreed by the House of Commons. The review was</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/8">&#8220;in particular to inquire into&#8230;issues relating to the membership of the Committee&#8230;the amount of time available to the Committee and the way in which the Government allocates that time&#8230;the powers of the Committee, and the process by which the Committee determines the matters to be debated in backbench time.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/9">The closing date for submissions was <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-08">Thursday 8 March</phrase>. Let us dwell on that for a moment. <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-08">Thursday 8 March</phrase> was two days after the Government tabled their motion and decided what the House would do. At best, that was a shoddy attempt by the Government to ignore a Select Committee; at worst, it was an attempt by the Government to interfere with a Select Committee, which could give rise to a number of issues for the Minister, possibly including a breach of the ministerial code and referral to the Standards and Privileges Committee. The Government might think that they can ignore the will of Parliament, but this is a different Parliament to previous ones. This Parliament is willing to stand up to an all-powerful Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/10">As the House is aware, Members were requested to send representations to the Procedure Committee by last Thursday. The first three things they were asked to consider were:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/11">&#8220;The composition of the Committee and the process for electing its members; whether the Chair of the Committee should be reserved for an opposition Member; whether a place on the Committee should be reserved for the minority parties.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/12">The top three issues, then, that we were asked to consider and report on to the Procedure Committee by last Thursday are exactly the three issues that the Government are trying to shoot through Parliament today.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/13">The Executive have decided, without waiting for the Procedure Committee report, that Committee members will be elected by party groups and that the Chair of the Committee will be an Opposition Member, and they have completely fudged the issue of the minority parties. The Government have predetermined the Procedure Committee&#8217;s inquiry before it has had time to collate the written evidence, take oral evidence and consider its report.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/1">Does my hon.

	<p pid="a.48.1/1">Of course that is the case. These elections will determine the Backbench Business Committee not for the term of the Parliament but for a year. If the Procedure Committee happened to report after the next elections and there was a change to procedure, the elections afterwards could be run on the new system. There was absolutely no need to prejudge the Select Committee report, apart from the fact that it might have resolved matters differently from what the Government wanted.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.3/2">I turn to one of the most appalling aspects of today&#8212;the whipping on the Conservative Benches. There is no question but that this is House business, and there is no question but that it is Back-Bench business. By convention, such votes should not carry a Whip; they should be free votes. There is no way that the Executive should try to instruct the House how to organise Back-Bench business affairs, but Conservative Members were told last week that we would be on a three-line Whip to vote for this outrageous motion. After protests, the Whips Office reduced it to a one-line Whip. <i>[Laughter.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> laughs, and of course he knows why the Whips Office did that: to keep Back Benchers away from the House. I have received a very nice text from a Member saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m out working in my constituency. Aren&#8217;t the xxx Whips very devious?&#8221; That is very true.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/3">After our protests, then, the Whips Office reduced the vote to a one-line Whip, but that is not a genuine free vote, because Members here will still be instructed how to vote. This is wrong, should not be happening and flies in the face of the coalition Government&#8217;s pledge to restore trust in Parliament. Even worse, I understand that Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries are on a three-line Whip to vote through this despicable motion. The very people who should have no interest in Back-Bench business are the ones who are being told to vote for the changes. I am more than happy to take an intervention from the Leader of the</p>

	<p pid="a.49.3/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/2">I turn to the amendments in my name and five of the seven other members of the Backbench Business Committee, including the Chairman. The purpose of amendments (d), (e) and (f) is to leave out the Government&#8217;s proposed changes to the election of Backbench Business Committee members. The Government are proposing that future members of the Committee will be elected by party group. There are two distinct disadvantages to that proposal. The first&#8212;I suggest that this is the reason for it&#8212;is that it will give the Government, as well as the shadow Government, greater influence in deciding who is elected to the Backbench Business Committee. Through their Whips Offices, they will try to engineer more pliable Members to be elected to the Committee. I believe that this will make the Committee much more divided on party lines. In all the time that the current Committee has met, there has been only one vote, and that did not divide it along party lines. The Government&#8217;s proposal will reduce the likelihood that independent parliamentarians will be elected to the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/3">Secondly, the authority that members of the Committee hold is greatly enhanced by their being chosen by the whole House. Their mandate comes from Back Benchers of all political persuasions, not by a narrow party group. The Wright Committee was clear on that issue, saying in paragraph 180 of its report on page 54:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/4">&#8220;We therefore recommend that a Backbench Business Committee be created. It should be comprised of between seven and nine members elected by secret ballot of the House as a whole&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/5">So there we have it: the Wright report recommends that individual members of the Committee should be elected by the whole House, not by party groups. That is what the House agreed when setting up the Backbench Business Committee&#8212;the House agreed with the Wright Committee. Now the Government want to change Standing Orders while a Select Committee is looking into the matter, and against the wishes of the Wright Committee and an earlier decision of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/6">In conclusion, I therefore wish to press my amendments, and if they are not accepted by the Government, I will seek your leave to divide the House, Mr Speaker. I will also be supporting the amendments in the name of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase>. I would urge Members both to support the amendments and to vote against the motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">Order. Several Members are seeking to catch my eye, so I give notice to the House that after the next speaker whom I intend to call&#8212;namely the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee&#8212;I will impose a time limit of four minutes on Back-Bench contributions, because I am keen to facilitate as many Back Benchers as possible. However, that will not apply to the next speech.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">I will keep my comments brief, in order that Back Benchers are given a bit more time.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/2">I am deeply disappointed that the Government have tabled this motion without consulting either the Procedure Committee or the Backbench Business Committee. It goes absolutely against the spirit of the sort of relationship that has grown up between the Backbench Business Committee and the Government. The fact that motions affecting the Backbench Business Committee&#8217;s operation have been tabled while the Procedure Committee is still looking at that matter in detail and asking for their ideas people far and wide, inside the House and beyond, means that today&#8217;s debate cannot be as informed as it should be. Furthermore, to allocate one and a half hours for such a debate is laughable. Members are being asked to make decisions on matters that require much more information.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/3">The Backbench Business Committee will produce its report either this week or next week. The Procedure Committee could work much more quickly on its review of the operation of the Backbench Business Committee if it needed to, and could report very quickly on it. If the Government were willing to withdraw the motion, I am certain that we would benefit from a debate informed by the end-of-term report from the Backbench Business Committee and by the Procedure Committee&#8217;s report, well before the end of the Session and timed to coincide with the elections to the Backbench Business Committee. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government are willing to consider withdrawing the motion and having a debate on these matters on another day? I am sure that the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40234" name="Greg Knight">the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr Knight)</phrase> and I would work very quickly to produce our Committees&#8217; reports in order to facilitate such a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/4">The amendments tabled in my name deal with the minority parties. This matter has been a running sore to the Backbench Business Committee. We are, by accident, a Committee of Members from England. We have three members from the east midlands region, and we are an entirely English Committee. We could be far more representative not only of Back Benchers but of the country as a whole if the minority parties were more actively involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.3/1">As a Member from Wales, I endorse what the hon. Lady has just said. She will be aware that the leading characters from Wales came to her to put their case for a St David&#8217;s day debate, and I am happy to report that the English members of the Committee yielded to that request, but it took two years to achieve that. The point that she makes about geographic spread is an important one.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.0/1">Indeed. Such representation would give added flavour to the Backbench Business Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.1/1">It is more than that; the Committee must be for Back Benchers of the whole House, not just those of the Government parties and the Labour Opposition. There are five other political parties in the House; surely they should be represented if it is to be a Back-Bench Committee of the whole House.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.51.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="51"  time="017:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0002.htm#12031215000734">
	<p pid="a.51.2/1">That goes to the heart of the amendments. The minority parties are Back Benchers. They can never really be Front Benchers. It is very unlikely that we will ever see a member of one of the minority parties at the Dispatch Box.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">Using the principle of proportionality is also wrong. The Committee has four members from the Conservative party, one from the Liberal Democrats and two from the Labour party, plus the Chair, who has a casting vote. An additional member from one of the minority parties would not automatically lose the Government their majority&#8212;certainly not during a coalition Government, and I see no reason why we should not consider expanding the number of members of the Committee if there were not a coalition.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">The Backbench Business Committee is different from other Select Committees, in that it represents all Back Benchers of the House. At the moment, however, we do that very poorly by not having representation from the minority parties. The Procedure Committee&#8217;s report of October 2011 recommended that these changes be made, and that an additional place on the Backbench Business Committee be created in order that the minority parties be given representation. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire has just made the point that, after the Procedure Committee had reported, we could table motions to amend what had been decided today. That is sort of true, but only the Government are able to table motions that affect the Backbench Business Committee. Quite rightly, we as a Backbench Business Committee cannot table motions that affect our own operation. What the right hon. Gentleman says is rather difficult unless it is within the Government&#8217;s agreement that the motions are tabled. That worries me. That brings me back to why the Government cannot simply wait until the Procedure Committee has produced its report and the Backbench Business Committee has told the House about its experiences in the one and a half years of its existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">Let me briefly support the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> that deals with the issue of the whole House participating in the elections. This goes back to the point that the Backbench Business Committee is somewhat different from other Select Committees, in that it represents all Back Benchers. Therefore, the whole House should have a say in who it wants on the Backbench Business Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.3/1">The hon. Lady and I both served on the Wright Committee, and I am sure that she remembers, as I do, that it was very much that Committee&#8217;s deliberate intention to achieve a cultural change in the House of Commons. Part of that was precisely the issue of the Backbench Business Committee being elected by and representing the whole House, not individual parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">That is absolutely right. We should not throw away that important principle today. I am worried by the fact that the Government have tabled these motions. There has been inadequate time to look at them and inadequate time to explore all the different consequences arising from them. We are dealing with something that is not broken, so I do not understand why the Government want to fix it.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.1/1">Apparently, some people in the Government think that under the current arrangements the Labour party can gang up to ensure that so-called troublemakers are on this Committee. Is that not to politicise the whole issue? The fact is that members of the Committee are independent. They are not troublemakers; they are independent-minded people. We should keep party politics out of this.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.2/1">That goes back to my point that the Backbench Business Committee is not broken. We do not vote on party lines and the discussions we have are not on party lines. Its members are independent-minded. They are members of different political parties, but the wider issue is about how we best represent Back Benchers as a whole. We currently have a spread on the Committee, with every type of Back Bencher in today&#8217;s Parliament represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">I urge Members to vote for the amendment that includes the minority parties as full voting members. We do not want them to be there only as a result of some kind of patronage of the Chair which allows them to attend and listen to the Committee&#8217;s words of wisdom. We want them to have full membership and full voting rights. I also urge support for the amendment tabled to allow the entire House to vote on who should represent Back Benchers on the Backbench Business Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.5/1">I find the proposals in the Government&#8217;s motion to be very unfortunate, as they are bringing party politics into this place when dealing with Back-Bench business matters. That is, as I say, most unfortunate&#8212;and, more importantly, it will be viewed as unfortunate by people outside this place, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/2">I suggest that a key aspect of the reassertion of Parliament was the formation of the Backbench Business Committee, which has proved&#8212;neither the Government nor Opposition Front-Bench Members have been able to suggest otherwise&#8212;to be an excellent method of holding the Executive to account, ensuring that matters of importance are debated here, at times against the wishes of the Government. I have heard no evidence from anybody that the Backbench Business Committee is not working well.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/3">I have my own reasons to be grateful to the Backbench Business Committee. The full-day debate that I led on Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-20">20 February</phrase> was the first time that the subject had been debated for many years. Whatever the views across the House, it was a good day for parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/4">It was a packed debate; we ran out of time; we heard many excellent contributions, including from former Foreign and Defence Secretaries. It was deemed by everyone who participated in the debate to be well worth while. At the time, the Government opposed it; they opposed even the wording of the motion, as we saw.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/5">It is therefore very regrettable that the Government have pre-empted the findings of the Procedure Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the operation of the Backbench Business Committee by producing their own recommendations today. The response from those on the Front Bench that they had to do it now, because if they did not it would be too late for the election, is complete and utter nonsense. The elections come round every Session: they come round every year. There is no real reason why the Government&#8217;s suggestions could not have waited until the Procedure Committee had presented its recommendations, and perhaps they could then have influenced the elections next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/6">I am afraid that, whatever my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House may say from the Dispatch Box, the justification does not stack up. There can be no doubt that implementation of the Government&#8217;s proposals would result in a weakening of the Committee. It would take power away from the Back Benches and Parliament and hand it back to the Executive, and that cannot be right. This is all about control.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/7">Finally, let me say something about the question of who selects the Chairman and Committee members. Surely all those who are selected as members of the Committee would have far more authority if they were elected by the whole House, rather than by party groups. That would enable the Committee to perform its role even better, with greater justification and, I would suggest, with greater credibility and integrity as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">You will recall, Mr Speaker, the sense of disappointment, outrage and anger two years ago, when we first learned of the membership of the Backbench Business Committee. We had been excluded, as though we did not exist. We were not entitled to a place on the Committee. That would not have been so important had it been just another Select Committee of the House&#8212;we expect to be excluded from those, because that is what the arithmetic does&#8212;but for us to be excluded from the Backbench Business Committee, a Committee of Members acting for other Members, was absolutely and utterly ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">When we complained, we were reassured. I was told, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Pete, it will be fine. As soon as we have the first opportunity to review this, we will put it right and ensure that it is fixed. We will have a place for you on the Committee.&#8221; And what did we get? Observer status. This is not the United Nations; this is the House of Commons, one of the Houses of Parliament. We do not do observer status in this place. What a ridiculous and utterly fatuous notion!

	<p pid="a.54.3/1">What we were making such a song and dance about was membership of the Committee. I should be delighted to be able to stand for the position of Chair of the Committee as a member of the Committee, but for me to be able to stand for that position without having a place on the Committee is utterly and absolutely ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">We in the minority parties will have to have a think about this. We cannot have a Backbench Business Committee of some of the House; it must be a Backbench Business Committee of the whole House. We decided that we would involve ourselves with the Committee over the last two years, despite our great disappointment about what happened. We were reassured by the Chair, who has been fantastic with the minority parties, and who has been able to work with us to ensure that we could at least secure some of our debates. However, we will now have to take a good long look at our relationship with the Committee. I suggest to other members of the smaller parties that we should be saying, &#8220;If you, the House, do not want us, why on earth should we have anything to do with you?&#8221; If this is to be a Back-Bench Committee consisting exclusively of members of the Government parties and the Labour Opposition, why should we have anything to do with it at all?</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">We must ensure that the Backbench Business Committee is a Committee of the whole House. The present arrangements are nonsense, the idea of observer status is absurd, and I appeal to the House to back the amendments and ensure that we have equality in the House. There are five other political parties here. There is more than just a Labour Opposition; there are other members, there are other parties, and we must ensure that we are properly represented in the House. The Wright Committee has been a disaster for the smaller parties. We have effectively been turfed out of Select Committees, and now the same is happening with other Committees in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">I urge Members to back the amendments. I urge them to ensure that there is justice for the smaller parties, and to ensure that we have a Backbench Business Committee that represents the whole House.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.4/1">I am a glutton for punishment, because as well as being a member of the Regulatory Reform Committee and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, I serve on the Backbench Business Committee and the Procedure Committee, so I follow the deliberations on these matters through the entire process.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.4/2">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> that the BBC should be a Committee of, as it were, the whole House. The Member who communicates with the minority parties should be a full Committee member and be elected by the whole House. I drafted a couple of technical amendments that would have ensured that the election for Committee members of the minority parties would have been the same as the election for those of the other parties, so that all are elected by the whole House. One reason for suggesting that is that not all political issues are party political.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.4/3">Essentially, the Government and Opposition Front-Bench teams are trying to shift the balance of power back towards the Executive. Let us consider the elections at the start of this Session. I was uncontested as the Liberal Democrat representative, and the four Conservatives were also uncontested. There were three candidates to be the two Labour representatives, but there have not been any by-elections since. We could therefore argue that the proposal under discussion may not make any difference. In practice, however, it is still moving away from the recommendations of the Wright report, which state that Parliament should operate as a Parliament, and not do everything divided along party lines. We need representatives from the parties to make sure that systems of communication are in place and that Members know that there is somebody they can talk to.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge the following fact: every other region of the United Kingdom can be represented&#8212;there can be a member from Wales, a member from England, a member from Scotland&#8212;but none of the three major parties have representatives from Northern Ireland? Who will speak with authority for the people of Northern Ireland?</p>

	<p pid="a.55.1/1">That is why I think it is important to have somebody from the minority parties elected by the whole House as a full member of the Committee. There has been one vote on one issue, and the rest of the decisions have, in effect, been made by consensus. In a House business committee, there would, obviously, have to be a Government majority. In this case, however, there is clearly no need to add an extra Member of the Government parties when adding a full Member communicating with the minority parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">My point is that the idea of having a BBC representing the Back Benchers of the whole House and elected by the whole House has worked very well and should not be changed.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">I think the Leader of the House has, in general, been an excellent Leader of the House; since he took up his post after the general election, he has, broadly speaking, done a good job, as has the Deputy Leader of the House. I therefore feel sorry that today is not a day when we are able to praise the Leader of the House, as I think the proposals he has come up with are ill-considered and ill-timed. I think that he has let himself down, to be honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">I say that because we are now coming to the end of a two-year Session. This will, I believe, be the longest parliamentary Session since 1643. That has given additional</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3">power to the Government, as they have been able to keep on having a go at getting legislation through in the other place. That is why we are still having a row about the health service Bill. If we had not had a two-year Session, many of its elements would have been ditched long ago&#8212;and likewise in respect of many other pieces of proposed legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/4">The Backbench Business Committee has been a genuine success, however. As has been said, the timing of this proposal is wrong because the Procedure Committee has not yet completed its business. The proposal is therefore a bit of an affront to it. Also, the Government had plenty of time to organise for today. They could have set about this process months ago, because we always knew that another set of elections was going to be held at the end of the second year. We could have started this process six months ago rather than recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/5">I also point out to the Leader of the House that the coalition agreement says that there will be a House business committee by the third year, which starts in a few weeks&#8217; time. We therefore should, in fact, be debating the House business committee tonight, not the Government trying to seize a bit of power in relation to the BBC.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/6">The amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> go to the heart of what it is to be a Member of Parliament. Every single one of us can be partisan. I can be extremely partisan on occasion. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Indeed, other hon. Members can be partisan, too. That is not wrong, as we were all elected on party tickets. My constituents in the Rhondda do not vote for me because I am a lovely, decent chap. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I think I have carried the House on that. They vote for me because they want a Labour Government and a Labour person to be elected.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/7">Of course, that partisan element of how we do our business and the way we tussle in the Chamber is part of making sure that the Government do a better job. I have no problem with being partisan, but we also have to rise above being partisan on occasion. We have sometimes let ourselves down on that and it is where the Leader of the House is doing so on this matter. It was a sadness that Robin Cook never managed to get some of these things through previous whipping organisations when we were in government, but it was a delight when people who were standing for election by the whole House&#8212;the Chairs&#8212;were lobbying all Members of the House; they actually wanted a mandate and wanted to understand what all the Members of the House thought. Surely that is why it is better that the members of the Backbench Business Committee should be elected by the whole House, not just by their individual parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/8">I launched my &#8220;save the backbench three&#8221; campaign last Friday because of a concern. The Committee has done a good job, having given us the best debates this year, whereas the Government have given us some pretty poor debates during the past year and for the past few months they have given us hardly anything to do at all. I fear that next year&#8217;s business will be a waste of time, unless we keep the &#8220;backbench three&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/1">It is a good thing that Chief Whips are not required to speak in these debates. We have heard some full tributes to the work of the Backbench Business Committee from the Deputy Leader of the House and his shadow, and I would be very surprised if the Government Chief Whip would be able to utter the same words of praise and thanksgiving for the work of the Backbench Business Committee, because the Committee has been an utter pain for the Government Whips Office. It is no good <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase> nodding her head, because the Committee has been bringing to the Floor of the House issues that very often neither Front-Bench team wanted brought here&#8212;they wanted to suppress them. That has been the great strength of this Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/2">If the coalition Government have a problem with who was elected to the Backbench Business Committee or how it was elected, they have nobody to blame but themselves, because some posts went uncontested. That shows a remarkable lack of assiduousness, given how the Whips Offices usually try to influence such elections. We should have no doubt that this operation today is an exercise designed to reduce the accountability and responsiveness of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/3">Let us briefly consider the detail of the motion. Most important is the proposal that the regularity of elections will reduced: they will be held once per Parliament. If this motion through, the election in the new Session will be the last this Parliament&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">I beg my hon. Friend&#8217;s pardon if I misunderstood things, and I stand corrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">The motion is also determined to reduce the way in which the membership of the Committee reflects the views of the whole House, on the basis of the spurious idea that parties voting for Members of other parties have a malign intent. The Chair is to be chosen from the Opposition, but that will reduce the Chair&#8217;s authority. The great authority that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> has is that she was elected as much by the votes of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats as by the votes of the Labour party. She was not a choice predetermined by the Standing Orders of this House and it was not a predetermined choice that she was chosen from her party.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">For all those reasons, we should want to defend the existing system, not least because the Wright Committee intended the election of the Backbench Business Committee and its Chair to be carried out on a different basis from the elections to the other Select Committees. The Deputy Leader of the House keeps saying that he has given a reason for needing to pre-empt the findings of the Procedure Committee. He may have given a &#8220;reason&#8221;, but it is an excuse and a motive; it is not a justification for pre-empting the findings of the Procedure Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/4">I wish to conclude by making a brief point. Those of us from the previous Parliament who went through&#8212;how shall I describe it?&#8212;the purifying fire of the expenses debacle came out of it determined that things should change in this House, that politics should change and that at least some of what happens in this House should</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/5">be taken out of the ghetto of the Westminster political parties talking to themselves. Are we now seeing this House reverting to type? Are we seeing the vested interests beginning to reassert themselves? I urge this House to be ever-more vigilant to make sure that that does not occur and ever-more vigilant because we are seeing today how determined the forces of darkness in politics can be.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">This debate is about power and those on the Front Benches are misguided in thinking that it will enhance ministerial power to seek to influence the way in which Back-Bench business is conducted against the interests of all the Back Benchers who have turned up and spoken in today&#8217;s debate. It is wrong of those on the two Front Benches to impose a Whip on Ministers and shadow Ministers&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I accept, then, that there is no such Whip on shadow Ministers, but we will see. We will study the Division results with great interest to see the view that shadow Ministers take. It is wrong for Front Benchers to seek to stop Back Benchers continuing with their arrangements in a timely way.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2">I share a common cause with my Front Benchers as I happen to think, as they seem to, that Ministers do not have enough power. I think that there is a danger that under any Government we could have Ministers in office but not in power, but the reason is not our powerful Backbench Business Committee and the fact that it makes them come to this House to discuss things that they do not wish to discuss. If Ministers do that well, it enhances their stature. The reason is that too many decisions are taken by the European Union, overridden by the European Court of Human Rights or taken by independent quangos. We have the Environment Agency, the Bank of England and United Kingdom Financial Investments; Ministers are very limited in what they can do. I would happily make common cause with those on my Front Bench in getting Ministers more power and think that many of my colleagues would take the same view. We would be cheering them if they came to this House and said that Ministers needed more power to settle our borders, sort out the problems with prisoners, deal with taxation or money supply and so on. We want it to be accountable power, however, which is why we want Ministers to have more power but think that they should come to the House of Commons to answer for how they exercise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/3">Ministers should get real. They are in danger of being in office but not in power because they will not take the accountable power they need to improve our country and to make the necessary changes. Their problem is not the Backbench Business Committee; their problem lies elsewhere. I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench to wake up and smell the coffee, as the phrase goes these days, and to understand that people want a strong, proud and independent Parliament and that people want their Ministers to come here to talk about the difficult issues on any day. They want Ministers to talk about the issue that they do not want to talk about today, because that is what matters and that is what is topical. A strong and confident Government can debate anything at any time about their conduct, their views and their policies and the more we make them debate it, the stronger their case should be. I want the Opposition to challenge them, I want the Backbench</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/4">Business Committee to challenge them and, above all, I want the decisions that matter for our country to be made here by accountable Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">There is absolutely no clamour from Back Benchers for any change in the method of election to the Backbench Business Committee. Let us be clear about that. I pray in evidence paragraph 59 of the fifth report of the Procedure Committee of this Session, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">&#8220;We have received no adverse comments on the arrangements for the elections to the Backbench Business Committee but there are two issues which have been raised in evidence to us which we now consider.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">One related to the representation of the minority parties and the Procedure Committee suggested adding a member to the Backbench Business Committee,</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">&#8220;to be elected by the whole House.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/5">The second issue was a rather technical matter relating to by-elections. There was no suggestion that the whole Committee and the nature of its members&#8217; election should be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/6">I submit as evidence Standing Order 152(1), which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/7">&#8220;Select committees shall be appointed to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the principal government departments as set out in paragraph (2)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/8">Paragraph (2) then lists 19 Departments; obviously, the Backbench Business Committee is not on that list. The Government have suggested today that the changes in the motion are needed to bring the Backbench Business Committee into line with other Select Committees. Incidentally, however, they also seek to differentiate the Committee from Select Committees when it comes to the length of membership. I understand why some Members might be confused about this. The Backbench Business Committee is and should be regarded as a Committee of the House and should be treated differently from Select Committees. On that basis, elections to it should be by the whole House and I urge Members to support the amendments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.1/1">This has been a passionate debate and I agreed with much of what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40437" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> had to say. Perhaps they gave their case a little less credit by resorting to elements of hyperbole&#8212;indeed, there were hints of hysteria coming from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> &#8212;but I agree fundamentally with what they said. This Executive, like every other Executive and&#8212;this is even sadder to see&#8212;shadow Executive, have an unhealthy tendency to meddle in matters that are best left to Parliament. That should rightly be resisted and it is through the Backbench Business Committee that we try our best to resist.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">Unlike any other Member who has spoken, perhaps, I think the motion is more of a curate&#8217;s egg. I believe that the Chairman of the Backbench Business Committee should be an Opposition Member. As has been pointed</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">out, in the initial election, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40516" name="Alan Haselhurst">the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst)</phrase>, who is a very good friend of mine and a distinguished parliamentarian, was pitted against the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire. I thought it would be very unhealthy for that role, particularly initially, to be in the hands of a former Deputy Speaker of 13 years&#8217; standing who was therefore very much part of the establishment, so I voted with my head rather than my heart. Like every other Member who has spoken I have been extremely pleased with the outcome and I pay great tribute to the wonderful work that the hon. Lady does in chairing the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">Let me pick up on the contribution of the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire. The Leader of the House would do well to recognise that every single party in the House of Commons is a minority party, and I think it is quite wrong that we are prescribing the rights of the minority parties. The suggestion in amendment (a), which I think would have come through with the Procedure Committee, that there should be a special member for all the minority parties, is something we should follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">I also believe there are very good reasons why the Backbench Business Committee should have some anonymous rules, as has been suggested by Ministers, for the election of its members, because it is by its nature an anonymous Committee: it is a Back-Bench Committee looking at Back-Bench business. I say that as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, which, alongside the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges, has different election arrangements. Those anomalies are open to a certain amount of criticism but are, none the less, rightly tolerated. If we do not adopt that approach, we run the risk of having approved party candidates rather than those who have the broadest party support. I shall be supporting amendments (a) and (d). There are elements of the motion with which I agree, but I regret the way in which it has led to the rancour we have seen in the past hour or so in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">I recall that the Leader of the House was one of the most eloquent advocates of Dr Tony Wright&#8217;s proposed reforms in this area. I also remember a famous conference speech in which he said that we would not resort to guillotines in the manner that had happened in the past. I also remember that when I was a student, the constitutional writers of the time used to discuss and describe the role and function of the Leader of the House. Fifty years ago they would argue that it was the most important role in the management of the House of Commons. The Leader of the House brought the views of the House to the Government and would try and influence them in the interests of the House and in the interests of the Government. It is a divided position; it is not an easy one. Yet here we see on the Order Paper, in the name of the Leader of the House, a motion that clearly has not been the result of any form of consultation, but has come from the very bowels of Government to assert their own primacy yet again.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">The debate is about the Backbench Business Committee. This is Back-Bench business, in a sense, yet we know the apparatus, as has been described by many Conservative</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">Members, through which the motion has come about. It is not to the credit of the Leader of the House that his name is the first of the proposers.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/4">The reforms have not been bad. They have been rather successful, and maybe it is their success that arouses fear. After all, we had a debate on a referendum. That is something that no Government&#8212;Labour or the present Government&#8212;would have tabled. We were able to discuss matters on which debate had been denied to Members for a very long time. I support much of the work of the Backbench Business Committee. It is essential that it carries on in future. I have always supported&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/5" class="italic">One and a half hours having elapsed since the commencement of proceedings on the motion, the Deputy Speaker put the Questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be concluded at that time (Order,  <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-07">7 March</phrase> ).</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December 2010</phrase>, the House agreed, without Division, to a motion agreeing with the principle set out in the twelfth report of the Committee</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">on Standards in Public Life that lay members should sit on the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges. The House invited the Select Committee on Procedure to bring forward proposals to implement that.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">The Procedure Committee published its proposals in its sixth report of the current Session, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-07">7 November</phrase> last year. The Government, and I am sure the whole House, are very grateful to that Committee for its work. The motion draws extensively on the work of the Procedure Committee, and follows consultation with that Committee, the Standards and Privileges Committee and others. I am pleased to say that the Procedure Committee has written to confirm that it broadly accepts the approach that we propose to take, and the support of the Standards and Privileges Committee is apparent from the welcome decision of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron)</phrase> to add his name to the motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">Before turning to the provisions of the motions, I will remind the House briefly of the background to the proposals. I need hardly remind Members that the expenses scandal rocked public faith in the House to its foundations. One part of that crisis lay in the House&#8217;s approach to disciplining Members, which, as the Committee on Standards in Public Life observed, did not command full public confidence. As Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee at the time when the Committee on Standards in Public Life inquired into these matters, I said that the then Standards and Privileges Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">&#8220;would be very happy to consider having outside members sitting on the Standards and Privileges Committee&#8230;particularly to assist us in coming to judgments where people may feel at the moment we are possibly too lenient.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">The Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended in November 2009 that</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/7">&#8220;there should be at least two lay Members who have never been Parliamentarians on the Standards and Privileges Committee&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/8">who</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/9">&#8220;should be chosen through the official public appointments process and formally approved by the House&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/10">The House endorsed that recommendation after its debate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December 2010</phrase>. I will not attempt to summarise all that was said on that day, but the most powerful case was made by the right hon. Member for Rother Valley. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/11">&#8220;Lay members provide the public with reassurance that the Committees are not cosy gentlemen&#8217;s clubs, where deals are stitched up and scandals are hushed up. They can also bring valuable outside experience and expertise with them.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-12-02.999"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 December 2010; Vol. 519, c. 999</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/12">He referred to the lay members of the Speaker&#8217;s Committee for the Independent Parliament Standards Authority. As a member of that committee, I can assure the House that the contribution of lay members is invaluable.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/13">I have already referred to the specific recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life that lay members should never have been parliamentarians. That is reflected in the motion, which also mirrors the statutory definition of lay members used for the Speaker&#8217;s Committee on IPSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/14">Amendment (b), tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40389" name="Alan Meale">the hon. Member for Mansfield (Sir Alan Meale)</phrase>, runs contrary to the letter and, more importantly, the spirit of the Kelly recommendations. I invite him to consider whether it would really enhance the credibility of the House&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/15">disciplinary procedures to appoint as a lay member a former hon. Member who left the House in 2005. I fear that that might be portrayed not as a fresh start but as a return to the bad old days, and of course public perception is part of the issue that we are seeking to address. I urge him not to move his amendment and invite the House to reject it if it comes to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/16">Of course, there is a difference between agreement in principle that a change should take place and agreement on how it will operate in practice. A number of significant issues have been raised about lay membership of a Select Committee, and I will explain briefly how those issues have been tackled in the motions.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/17">The first issue, identified by the Procedure Committee, was that although there had been no suggestion that lay members were appropriate for the consideration of privilege matters, there was no straightforward way to exclude them from such business within the structure of a single Committee. The solution proposed by that Committee, which the main motion today incorporates, was to create two separate Committees, one on standards and one on privileges. That is actually a reversion to the position that existed until 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/18">As the Procedure Committee recommended, provision has been made in motions 3 and 4 for the Chair of the Committee on Standards to inherit the pay now received by the Chair of the Committee on Standards and Privileges. The Government have also made it clear in their response that the Chair of the Committee on Standards, like that of the current Committee, should be drawn from the Opposition Benches. In accordance with the current arrangements, that does not need to be set out in Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/19">Our intention today is not to change the composition of the Committees. The two Committees may have a common membership, and they may choose to elect the same Chair. Even if that is not the case, the Committee of Privileges is likely to meet less often and will be able to consider only matters referred to it. In those circumstances, and following the precedent of the Committee on Members&#8217; Expenses, pay for the Chair of the Committee of Privileges is unlikely to be appropriate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.73.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="73"  time="018:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0002.htm#12031239002028">
	<p pid="a.73.0/1">I wholeheartedly support what the Leader of the House is doing in separating the two Committees, which is long overdue. Will the process remain that a matter of privilege is raised through the Speaker and then in a three-minute speech, before going to the Privileges Committee? Will that Committee also be able to consider any draft legislation on privilege that the Leader of the House publishes? I believe he told me earlier this year that he would publish draft legislation before Easter.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman looks at the explanatory memorandum, he will see that the terms of reference of the new Committee of Privileges will be the same as those of the relevant part of the Committee on Standards and Privileges. There will be no change to the process by which a matter is referred to the Committee, or to its remit. The position will remain that it can consider only things that the House refers to it and that are within its terms of reference.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.2/1">I am grateful. The other bit of the process that has always worked well thus far is that whenever the Committee on Standards and Privileges</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">has produced a report, Government time has been provided to debate it. Will that be true of both Committees in future?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.74.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40452" speakername="George Young" colnum="74"  time="018:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0002.htm#12031239002031">
	<p pid="a.74.0/1">Again, the hon. Gentleman anticipates something that I may say a little later, but if he looks at paragraph 176 of the Wright Committee&#8217;s report, he will see what is deemed Back-Bench business and what is deemed business that the Government should schedule. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/2">&#8220;Backbenchers should schedule backbench business. Ministers should give up their role in the scheduling of any business except that which is exclusively Ministerial business, comprising Ministerial-sponsored legislation and associated motions, substantive non-legislative motions required in support of their policies and Ministerial statements&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/3">It may help the hon. Gentleman if I say that the Government will ensure that there is adequate time to debate on the Floor of the House any matter referred to the House by the Committee on Standards or the Committee of Privileges. I suspect that there will be a dialogue with the Backbench Business Committee to ensure that time is available at the appropriate moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/4">Amendment (c), tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40406" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>, would set down in Standing Orders a requirement that the membership of the two new Committees should always be the same. The Procedure Committee examined the case for a requirement of identical membership in paragraph 63 of its report, and concluded that the case had not been made. I recognise that there is a case for an element of shared membership, and possibly even for identical membership, but the Government, like the Procedure Committee, do not support the notion that there should be an inflexible provision to that effect in Standing Orders. With that assurance, I hope he will not move his amendment. In splitting the Standards and Privileges Committee, the Government do not intend to revisit the decisions taken at the beginning of this Session on appropriate Committee membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/5">The second issue that has been raised about lay members is their status. The Committee on Standards and Privileges has stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/6">&#8220;if the proposed external members of the Standards and Privileges Committee are to carry credibility, they need to have full voting rights.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/7">The Procedure Committee considered the matter carefully and in great detail, and it invited the House to study with care the arguments for and against full voting rights. As the Government made clear in our response, we have carefully considered the arguments about whether lay members should have full voting rights. We have concluded that it would not be appropriate to grant such rights in the first instance, in view of the authoritative evidence given to the Procedure Committee that it would create a risk that lay members&#8217; participation would not have the protection of parliamentary privilege.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/8">Lay members will be able to participate fully in evidence taking and informal consideration of draft reports. In addition, there will be two specific protections for their position. The first is the requirement that any written opinion of a lay member present at the relevant meeting on a report agreed by the Committee must be published as part of its report. The second is that the Committee cannot conduct any business unless at least one lay member is present.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/9">A decision to proceed on that basis will provide a guarantee of the effective participation of lay members in the decision-making processes of the Committee, and can be taken without prejudice to subsequent consideration of full voting rights. The Government will consider the case for legislation that would place beyond doubt the position of a Committee on Standards including lay members with full voting rights, as part of our work on preparing the forthcoming draft parliamentary privilege Bill and the accompanying Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/10">The third and final issue that has been raised about lay members was voiced in the debate in December 2010 and echoed in the Procedure Committee&#8217;s report. It relates to the selection of lay members and control over how they subsequently carry out their work. The motion proposes to entrust that matter to the House of Commons Commission, which would also take responsibility for a motion for dismissal in the unlikely eventuality that it should prove necessary. I believe that the Commission, chaired by the Speaker, is the best way to ensure that there is a fair and open process that leads to the House being asked to appoint only excellent candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/11">I know that some concern has been expressed about the term of office of lay members. The Procedure Committee recommended single five-year terms. However, it also acknowledged uncertainty about appointments straddling two Parliaments. The motion therefore provides for appointments for the remainder of one Parliament and reappointments for a period of up to two years in a new Parliament. Although I understand the advantages of a single term, the Government remain to be convinced that it is appropriate for lay members to be appointed for a period that, by definition, lasts longer than the appointment of hon. Members. There will be a very strong presumption indeed that lay members will be reappointed for a further term at the start of the subsequent Parliament. If they were not, the Committee on Standards would find it difficult to operate. I offer my commitment that the Government will assist in such a process.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.0/2">There is a more detailed issue: cost. If lay members are involved in the Committee on Standards, especially lay members with a legal background, surely any Member of the House before it will demand expensive legal representation. Will the cost of that representation be met by the Committee, or will an individual Member be expected to meet it through his own resources?</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">There might be no desire to change the Committee&#8217;s procedure, but I suspect that there will be a different approach outside, particularly among the media. There will be much more scrutiny of a Committee that has lay members, particularly if they are high-profile legal figures. What protection will there be for MPs who find themselves subject to an investigation under the new regime, so that they have what they consider to be essential legal advice, which might come extremely expensively?</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">My answer now is the same one I gave to my hon. Friend a moment ago: there is no change in the resources available to hon. Members. Currently, some decide to take legal advice and pay for it out of their own pocket; others simply represent themselves. We are not proposing changes to the way in which Members interface with the Committee, but seeking to ensure that the Committee&#8217;s decisions have greater credibility in the outside world by adding lay members to it. That is the only change that we propose to make.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/1">We are trying to get lay members. Whether a judge is a &#8220;lay member&#8221; is an interesting question. Speaking off the cuff, I do not think we propose to exclude any particular profession. Whether a high-powered judge would want to put his name forward to the House of Commons Commission for this interesting post I am not sure, but it will be a matter for the Commission to consider the candidates that come forward. Some might have a legal background. I am not quite sure that it would be appropriate to appoint a serving judge as a lay member, but somebody with a legal background might not be wholly disqualified.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/2">May I move on to safer territory, namely amendment (a), which was tabled by the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee? The amendment would exclude business arising on a report from the Committee on Standards from the definition of Back-Bench business. It would thus prevent the Backbench Business Committee ever scheduling business arising from the work of one Select Committee and return exclusive control over that business to the Government, which is contrary to the spirit of the Wright recommendations&#8212;I read paragraph 176 a few moments ago.</p>

Although there may be a dialogue on that matter in due course, I do not think this is the right forum in which to</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/4">consider it. It could certainly be considered in the review currently being conducted by the Procedure Committee. I would invite the hon. Lady not to move her amendment. If she does, I urge the House to oppose it if it is pressed to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I put my name down to speak in the debate, but my point is such a small one that I can make it in an intervention. The issue is not whether reports from the Committee on Standards are defined as Back-Bench business, but time. Thirty-five days a Session are allocated to Back-Benchers, but that is limited, and time for debates on such reports will be scooped out of Back-Bench time in an unpredictable way. If the Leader of the House confirms that any time taken by debates on those reports is in addition to the 35 days, I will be more than happy not to move the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">The overall settlement of 35 days included an allowance for standards and privileges matters. As I have said, what the Government are left with does not include such business. The amendment is an ingenious shop-steward bid&#8212;if I may say to the hon. Lady&#8212;for extra time. If a matter comes before the House from the Standards Committee, or indeed from the Privileges Committee, there will be a debate in the House on that matter at the right time, whoever provides the allocation. That is the assurance that the House wants, and we can have a dialogue offline, as it were, on how that is accounted for in the annual tally between the Backbench Business Committee and the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">But actually, that is not quite how the process works now, is it? First, privilege issues, as opposed to standards issues, must go through the Speaker, who then forcibly makes time available, normally on the next day, and therefore always in Government time. The Leader of the House obviously thinks that he has made some improvements on Wright today, but perhaps another improvement he could make is to guarantee that time to debate privilege matters will come out of Government time.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">There is a distinction between a debate when a matter is referred to the Privileges Committee, which is normally relatively short, and a debate on a report from the Privileges Committee or the Standards Committee when they have concluded their consideration, but I accept what the hon. Gentleman says: if the Speaker decrees that a matter should be debated, it is debated. In response to the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire, I said that it is important that the House debates such reports once we have them. The business managers and the Backbench Business Committee can have a dialogue on whether the time comes out of the Committee&#8217;s quota, which, I should say in passing, we have generously exceeded in the current Session&#8212;we have gone way over 35 days to somewhere near 50 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">This risks becoming a general debate on the role of the Backbench Business Committee and whether the time allocated to it is generous enough. I have sought to address the proposition put by the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire. My case is that the putting of lay members on the Standards Committee is not an opportunity to revisit the balance of time between the Government and the Backbench Business Committee. My assertion is that that is best done in the context of the review of the Committee currently being undertaken by the Procedure Committee. When we have that review, we will be in a better position to take that dialogue forward. In the meantime, I give an assurance that any report that comes from the Standards Committee will be debated promptly.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">To conclude, I believe the motion provides an effective and appropriate means of giving effect to the principle agreed by the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December 2010</phrase>. It represents one more step to ensure that public confidence in the conduct of hon. Members is maintained and strengthened, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">The Opposition support the principle that lay members should sit on a newly constituted Committee on Standards. We also understand and support the pragmatic solution of splitting the current Committee in two to avoid the complications and uncertainty that could arise if non-MPs were to sit on the Privileges Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/2">When the issue was first considered at the end of last year, we did not seek to divide the House on the approach suggested. Although it is not directly analogous because all MPs are elected&#8212;and therefore ultimately accountable to their constituents&#8212;the principle of appointing lay members to a standards Committee is widely adopted in other areas of public life. For example, both the Bar Council and the General Medical Council have lay members.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/3">On the other hand, the Press Complaints Commission also has lay members, and given the mess that it now finds itself in, perhaps we should take this opportunity to remind ourselves that lay membership of any committee is not in itself a complete answer to the challenges of upholding the standards of conduct and behaviour expected of any particular group of people, be they lawyers, doctors, MPs or&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;journalists. Undoubtedly, however, the presence of lay members should reassure the public that the Standards Committee is not some kind of cosy stitch-up but is there to deliver a rigorous and robust process that is fair to all and therefore credible. That is obviously in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/4">I congratulate the Procedure Committee on its work on this issue since the House&#8217;s resolution last year and on bringing this change about. I note, however, that the Government have ignored the Committee&#8217;s recommendation to give the House a further opportunity to vote on the principle of lay membership. Although the Opposition are in favour of the principle, it is noticeable that in evidence to the Procedure Committee a number of Members raised concerns about the appointment of lay members. Those Members included, from the Government Benches, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/5">In its report, the Procedure Committee states that</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/6">&#8220;it is right to register our concern at the level of unease felt by many Members about the House&#8217;s decision of <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-02">2 December</phrase>. It may well be that, having considered the examination of the practical and privilege implications as set out in our report, the House may wish to reconsider its view of the principle of adding lay members to the Committee on Standards and Privileges.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/7">Will the Leader of the House explain why the Government have chosen not to tackle this unease head-on and do as the Procedure Committee suggested? Perhaps it is because of the decision to split the current Committee, but I would like to hear the Government&#8217;s explanation for their decision not to have a further vote on the principle itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/8">We support the appointment of lay members to the Standards Committee. The Procedure Committee has found that the appointment of lay members is not completely without precedent&#8212;it cites a 1933 committee on the future government of India. I must say, however, that that is a rather particular example and not one likely to be replicated any time soon. It must not be assumed that simply appointing lay members to the Standards Committee will do the trick. It is clearly not a panacea.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/9">Moreover, how lay members should take part in Committee proceedings needs to be clearly defined. This the Procedure Committee has done. It has recommended that Members of the House make up the majority of the new Standards Committee&#8212;after all, it will be a Committee of the House&#8212;and the proposals outlined in the proposed new Standing Orders, which adopts the recommendations of the Procedure Committee, suggests appointing at least two but no more than three lay members. That strikes a sensible balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/10">We also agree with the proposed powers of lay members as outlined in the motion. The Standards Committee will be a Committee of the House, and the Members of Parliament who serve on it will be able to do so first and foremost because they successfully stood for election. Therefore, they are ultimately accountable to their constituents for their actions, as are all of us, and following the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, they submit themselves to that judgment every five years. Lay members of the Committee will not be elected but will be appointed, and they will not have to justify their actions at the ballot box.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/11">The Procedure Committee therefore had to consider how that difference could best be accommodated in the day-to-day workings of the Committee. It considered two options: whether members of the Committee should have full voting rights or whether they should be appointed with more limited rights. In its impressive survey of the history of Committees of the House and the operation of committees in Parliament&#8217;s around the Commonwealth, the Procedure Committee came across few examples of lay members voting. In its survey of the Commonwealth, only the New South Wales Legislative Assembly had given lay members of a Committee voting rights. But that practice, confined to one Committee in New South Wales, has now ceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/12">To give lay members voting rights would also raise difficult questions of privilege, as the Leader of the House pointed out. He also pointed out that the Procedure Committee outlined the issues, as set out in the evidence of the parliamentary Clerk to the Procedure Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/13">For those reasons, like the Government, we support the second option, which would mean that lay members could fully participate in the Committee by questioning witnesses but could not vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/14">The proposed new Standing Orders require the Committee to publish any paper from a lay member setting out that lay member&#8217;s opinion on the report. We recognise that a balance has to be struck if lay members of the Committee are not to have voting rights. Nevertheless, we recognise the concerns raised by some Members, including the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex, about the publication of dissenting reports. I note that the right for a lay member to publish a dissenting report was described in the Government&#8217;s weekend spin on our proceedings today as a &#8220;golden share&#8221;, which is a nicer name for a veto. Perhaps the Leader of the House could let us know in more detail how he sees that power working.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/15">Amendment (b) suggests that ex-Members should be eligible for selection as lay members after only five years out of the House. That seems like a way of ensuring that lay members are not quite lay members and runs the risk of undermining the credibility that the reforms will bring about. Amendment (c) suggests that the membership of the soon-to-be-separated Standards and Privileges Committee should be the same. That runs the risk of undermining the separation, and we believe that the membership of these important Committees could easily be different and certainly should not be made the same by changing the Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/16">I do not want to spend too much time intruding on the debate between the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee and the Leader of the House, but her amendment raises an extremely important issue about the number of days allocated to her Committee. That is one of those issues that will rumble on. Suffice it to say that I have considerable sympathy with what she says.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/17">We support the other proposals in the proposed new Standing Orders. They are a welcome advance designed to improve public confidence, but they are not a panacea. The PCC, for example, had lay members, and that did not make the body effective or ensure that the organisation retained public confidence. Public confidence in Parliament, as the Leader of the House said, was significantly damaged by the expenses scandal. The appointment of lay members will not in itself restore that confidence, but it is one of many steps taken since then to repair the damage done.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/18">I have been a Member of the House for 20 years, and I believe that, overwhelmingly, Members are committed to public service, strive to serve their constituents and seek at all times to uphold the Nolan principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/2">I merely want to thank my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. There has been discussion in the Standards and Privileges Committee, and between the Committee and him, following which some positive changes have been made. In particular, we mentioned whether the lay members may, or have to, produce a report. The reason behind my amendment (c)&#8212;this was picked up and covered by the Leader of the House&#8212;is that there is a logic and a bureaucratic advantage to having the same Members on each Committee. However, as was said by the Leader of the House&#8212;and, to my amusement, by the Opposition spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase>&#8212;there is also the opportunity, if required and if appropriate, for that to be altered. For that reason, I shall not press my amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.81.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40389" speakername="Alan Meale" colnum="81"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0002.htm#12031239002050">
	<p pid="a.81.3/1">I commend the work of the Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee and its members for the excellent work that they do on our behalf. We know that their work is arduous and at times difficult. Let me state at the outset that it is my intention not to challenge but to improve the proposed Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/2">If accepted, my amendment (b) would in no way undermine the Committee&#8217;s excellent work. As many in the Chamber will realise, I and another Member, who sits on the Government Benches, act as co-opted representatives of the retired Members association, a body that was established to represent the interests of retired Members, of whom there are hundreds, many very elderly indeed. When these Standing Orders are approved, they will undoubtedly affect ex-Members of Parliament, or at the very least are likely to affect them. For instance, the proposed Standing Orders would quite rightly deal with the register and any reviews of it. That could be of interest to ex-Members, not least ex-Ministers, given the role they play after leaving office. The Standing Orders will also allow papers and records to be sent for that are more than likely to involve ex-Members and their time in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/3">Importantly, my amendment does not ask for someone from the ranks of ex-Members to be appointed as a lay member; indeed, I fully accept the principle of free and open competition involved in any such appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/4">However, I feel strongly that ex-Members should not be excluded from the process, although I accept the need for a certain period of time to elapse. That is why I propose that any ex-Member would have had to have left Parliament a minimum of five years previously&#8212;it would probably be longer than that&#8212;before being even considered as a lay member. They could not be a Member in this place or the House of Lords, and if they became a Member at any time during their lay membership, that would mean their ceasing to be a lay member.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/5">I was interested to hear what the Leader of House said about those who left this place in 2005. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40406" name="Paul Beresford">the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>, I think we need to cut this debate short, but I have to say that ex-Members of Parliament, like current Members, are not pariahs. They are not the unclean or the unwashed; they are people who have given many, many years of loyal public service in this place. Most of the people who retired at the last two elections&#8212;indeed, the vast majority&#8212;were guilty of no impropriety and left with no challenge whatever to their characters. This is an important matter: these changes to standards will affect ex-Members, and it is really quite wrong to introduce Standing Orders just so that we can be clear about the public and press perception of those Standings Orders in future. Those ex-Members have the right to be represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/6">I accept what the Leader of the House said about this probably not being the right time to pursue such an amendment. For that reason, I will not press my amendment to a vote. However, I say this to the Leader of the House: in future years this issue will have to be dealt with, because we cannot have a situation where hundreds of ex-Members&#8212;indeed, there might be thousands by that time&#8212;are affected by Standing Orders that they are not able to challenge or play any part in whatever.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.4/1">I welcome this motion standing in the name of the Leader of the House; indeed, as Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee, I appended my name to it. As he said, the Committee has long called for lay members, and I personally have no doubt that having them will be of worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/2">The House has accepted that principle. Indeed, in the debate back in December, I said that for a number of years I had been a lay member of the General Medical Council and that I felt that I had brought some experience to the table&#8212;albeit not experience of clinical decision making, but experience that doctors and others could</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/3">consider in sitting in judgment on their fellow professionals and in assessing whether their decisions were the right ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/4">In an ideal world, the Committee would have liked lay members to have had full voting rights and single, non-renewable terms to guard their independence, very much as the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has. He has five years and that is it; there is no reappointment. As a consequence, there is no way that he might be looking for any preferment for a second term, from this House or anybody within it. However, we are not in an ideal world. There are significant constitutional barriers and uncertainties about giving lay members full voting rights, and the Leader of the House has made the Government&#8217;s position on fixed terms clear. However, this motion still represents a significant step towards ensuring that the House&#8217;s disciplinary processes are fair and seen to be fair, and that we benefit from outside experience and expertise. I welcome the change to Standing Orders wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/5">As for the other matters that have been discussed&#8212;how the Committee will be split up, the timing, the membership of both Committees, and everything else&#8212;these are matters for the House. However, what we are doing is the right thing for the House to do and embodies the right principle for us to be establishing, so that people outside this place can have confidence that when we sit in judgment over our peers, people are not looking after the interests of fellow professionals&#8212;if that is indeed what we are&#8212;but passing right and proper judgment on someone who may have breached the rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.5/1">Briefly, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase>, the shadow Leader of the House, asked why we had put back to the House the original proposition</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/2">about lay members. We dealt with that in our response to the Procedure Committee&#8217;s report. Basically, what we said was that on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-02">2 December</phrase>, the House of Commons agreed without Division to a motion that endorsed the principle that lay members should sit on the Standards and Privileges Committee. The Government do not believe it necessary for the House to be asked to restate its acceptance of a principle that it has already agreed without Division. Indeed, there has been broad acceptance of that principle in the debate this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/3">I am obviously grateful that those who have tabled amendments have said that they do not propose to press them to a Division&#8212;a tribute to the eloquence that I must have used at the beginning of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/4">The final question that I was asked was about the so-called golden share. I am convinced that the Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee will continue to do what has been done in the past, namely to secure unanimous reports on the matters that come before him&#8212;or, indeed, her. While I chaired the Committee, I do not think we ever had a vote. I therefore very much hope that it will not be necessary for anybody to table a minority report. However, the fact that the lay members have that option will reassure people outside that the Committee has a broader base than it has had so far, and will avoid the accusation that this is some sort of gentlemen&#8217;s club that deals leniently with its members. On that basis, I hope that we can agree the motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.4/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As you rightly say, there are two motions on the Order Paper in my name. The first is the more important: it invites the House to approve a revised code of conduct. The House of Commons has long had resolutions covering conduct, but the idea of a code of conduct is relatively recent. It was not until 1995 that the House endorsed the principle of such a code. Since then, the code has been revised, in 2002 and in 2005. This is only the fourth version of the code since the first version was approved in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/2">In approving the code of conduct today, the House will be setting the framework for the rules that will, I hope, last for the remainder of this Parliament and into the next. It is important to be clear about what the code is for. It is not a rule book that sets out precise instructions about what is and is not permissible in each case. As the commissioner has set out in a memorandum attached to our report, it is a document that establishes</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/3">&#8220;broad high-level principles in relation to the main areas of a Member&#8217;s conduct&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/4">and</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/5">&#8220;provides a high-level statement of the specific rules to which Members will be held to account&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/6">All those who responded to the commissioner&#8217;s consultation supported this approach. Relying on detailed rules designed to meet every eventuality creates the risk that people will be encouraged to game the system. We have only to look at the creativity of tax avoidance schemes to see that. The code has a broader function: it helps us to ensure that we behave in a way that is consistent with the seven principles of public life&#8212;the Nolan principles, which are part of the code and which underpin its provisions. Where appropriate, the code is supplemented by more detailed statements of some of the rules, such as the guide to the rules, and the rules on the use of House facilities, but Members have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that they abide by the principles of the code.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/7">The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has the task of reviewing the code and making recommendations to the Committee. In 2002, the Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended that this should be done once in each Parliament. Following the expenses scandal, we judged it better to defer a review of the code in the last Parliament, in order to give Members of the new Parliament an opportunity to review it in the light of experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/8">The commissioner&#8217;s memorandum to the Committee sets out all the changes to the code clearly, and explains the reasoning behind each of them. Our report focuses on all the provisions that we consider most significant. Broadly speaking, the commissioner&#8217;s proposals have the effect of making the code clearer and removing some repetitions and infelicities. The most significant proposed change is in paragraph 2 of the code. The current code</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/9">&#8220;does not seek to regulate what Members do in their purely private and personal lives&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/10">but it does extend to their wider public lives. Our proposal is that the code will no longer apply to Members&#8217; wider public lives. As the commissioner points out, Members&#8217; behaviour in their wider public life will be policed by other regulatory bodies, and there will be no need for the House to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/11">There is an important proviso to the exclusion from the code of private and personal lives or wider public life. Those areas should be excluded unless</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/12">&#8220;such conduct significantly damages the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole or of its Members generally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/13">That is not an entirely new provision. Paragraph 15 of the present code stipulates that Members should</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/14">&#8220;never undertake any action which would bring the House of Commons, or its Members generally, into disrepute.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/15">Personal life is currently excluded from the code, but a Member&#8217;s wider public life is not. The code will extend only to conduct which</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/16">&#8220;significantly damages the reputation and integrity of the Commons as a whole or of its Members generally&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.4/17">That is a very high hurdle indeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">The hon. Lady makes an interesting point. I was about to move on to talk about the amendment, and we can look at that question in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">The amendment is also in the name of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40129" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker)</phrase>, and I am sure that he will explain it later in the debate. It raises significant questions. As I understand it, the amendment would mean that matters relating to a Member&#8217;s private and personal life which damaged the reputation and integrity of the House or of Members generally would remain within the scope of the code, but that the commissioner would be precluded from investigating complaints about such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">That raises a number of difficult questions. How would the boundaries of private and personal lives be defined? Would a matter remain private and personal if, for example, it had led to criminal behaviour or a failure to comply with civil obligations? Does something remain purely private and personal when it has been running all over the press and the internet for six or seven days? What is an investigation? Would the commissioner be precluded from giving a Member the chance to put his or her side of the story in private, rather than before the</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">Committee as a whole? If the commissioner were unable to investigate extreme cases involving a Member&#8217;s personal and private life, would the Committee be expected to investigate them? If so, the Member&#8217;s safeguards would be reduced, as the Committee would investigate and pronounce sentence. I would feel uncomfortable about that. We are an adjudication Committee; we do not carry out investigations. The amendment seems to suggest that we might do so, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">I understand colleagues&#8217; fears that complaints could flood in about private lives, and that the commissioner might have to investigate matters that were properly no one&#8217;s business but that of the Member concerned. That is not what is intended. The House should have trust in the commissioner, in the Committee and in itself. Serious cases of a fall in standards should be decided on the Floor of the House, and not by the commissioner or by the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">I am confident that the commissioner will not investigate purely private matters. If some future commissioner did so, I am confident that the Committee would take a robust approach, and that any serious sanction recommended by the Committee would come to the House, which would decide whether it was merited. I ask Members to have faith that all those involved, including the House, would use common sense if these measures were ever applied. I, for one, hope that they never will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/7">The new provision is intended only for extreme circumstances, described by the commissioner as those in which a Member&#8217;s conduct in certain extremely limited circumstances is so serious and so blatant that it causes significant damage to the reputation of the House. In my judgment, it would be even more damaging to the reputation of the House and to the public&#8217;s confidence in the code of conduct&#8212;which is one of its key purposes&#8212;if the House were unable to take action to express its disapproval and uphold its standards in such circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.4/1">We are looking at paragraph 15 of the current code of conduct and paragraph 16 of the amended code of conduct. It is curious that the wording has been changed. Paragraph 15, which is where we are at the moment and seems to me to be sensible, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/2">&#8220;Members shall at all times conduct themselves in a manner which will tend to maintain and strengthen the public&#8217;s trust&#8221;&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.88.7/1">I will come back to that, if I may, but I want to carry on citing what the commissioner said in the memorandum, which the Committee accepted. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/2">&#8220;But the conduct would need to be so serious and so blatant as to make it imperative that the House be given the opportunity to consider the damage done to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole or of its Members generally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/3">The code does not seek to judge the behaviour as right or wrong&#8212;only the effect it has on the reputation and</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/4">standing of the House. In my view, that is a hugely important thing to defend in our democracy, particularly after the events of the last four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/5">Let me deal with other issues that we need to look at. The Government are currently consulting on proposals to allow the House to decide whether or not to permit the opening of a recall petition in cases where the House considers a Member&#8217;s conduct warrants it. Does that mean purely in respect of their public life, or does it mean in their private or personal life as well? I think that we stray into these issues with the amendment, which is why I think the House would be better to stand back from it and have a look at things in the round at a later stage. Without a provision such as the one I am proposing, the House risks being either ineffectual, because the code does not allow it to deal with behaviour that everyone agrees is reprehensible, or arbitrary because it takes action even though such behaviour is not covered by the code. That seems to be the intention. The alternative is that we end up relying on legal semantics to decide whether something is still &#8220;purely personal and private&#8221;, which is absolutely not how the code should operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/6">As our report says, this is a provision for extreme circumstances. It does not invite the Committee or the House to judge a Member&#8217;s purely private and personal relationships and will not be used to do so. This is not to turn the House into a moral arbiter, but to allow it to protect the integrity of Parliament. It is a judgment on the effect of a Member&#8217;s conduct on that vital objective, not a judgment on the Member&#8217;s morals.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/7">I cannot support the amendment, but I can suggest an alternative, more appropriate, way forward. The commissioner consults the Committee on certain matters. For example, if someone is referred to the police because the commissioner is concerned about a police investigation that might have implications for the criminal law, the commissioner comes to the Committee and provides evidence to show why the referral should take place. We are then asked either to agree it or reject it. Paragraph 104 of the guide to the rules also makes it clear that the Committee expects to be consulted before accepting an investigation of a complaint against a former Member, a complaint that goes back more than seven years, or one where a member has asked the commissioner to investigate allegations without being the subject of a specific complaint. With a self-referral, the commissioner has to come before the Committee and ask our permission for this to take place. The commissioner is currently consulting on revisions to the guide to the rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.7/8">Let me say to the House and to those who tabled the amendment that I would be happy to ask the Committee to consider adding consideration of complaints relating to a Member&#8217;s private and personal life to the category of matters for which the commissioner should not accept investigation without first consulting the Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">Well, I thank the hon. Gentleman for the speech. He is a hard-working member of the Committee, as well as a member of other Committees that look into standards in public life. He is well worth listening to.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/1">I apologise for not being in my place for the start of the debate; I was rather taken aback by the speed of previous proceedings. Let me try to put it this way. Building on what the right hon. Gentleman said a few moments ago, would he accept that the purpose of paragraph 16A is to create a presumption against investigation of private life unless the Committee determines in its judgment that such an investigation should take place?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.90.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="90"  time="019:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0003.htm#12031239002085">
	<p pid="a.90.2/1">Yes, I understand that point, but I fear that the intention could be misinterpreted. I fully understand the issue that the right hon. and learned Gentleman raises, and I hope that the hon. Member for Broxbourne will tell us about the amendment in more detail. If it is withdrawn, it will be perfectly possible to return to the issue when the revised guide to the rules comes before us in the not-too-distant future. That revision to the guide will be more detailed than what appears in the current three-page code of conduct, which is out for consultation. If the Committee itself has not proposed that the commission should consult before opening an inquiry into personal and private matters, the House could insert such a provision, but I feel that the provision would be more helpful in the guidance than in a code of conduct that tends to contradict elements of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">The other important clarification is the introduction of a new paragraph 15 making it clear that Members are personally responsible for the extent to which their use of expenses and allowances accords with the rules. Clearly there is nothing new in that. The current Members&#8217; handbook warns Members that the facilities and services of the House are provided to assist Members in their parliamentary work and should be used appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">Defining parliamentary purposes is, of course, not easy. Members&#8217; roles are various, and we are, with very rare exceptions, elected as party candidates and uphold our parties in Parliament. That is very different from using public funding for party campaigning, or to support party organisations. Having considered the definition extremely carefully, the Committee recommends that the rules make it clear that public money should not be used to</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/4">&#8220;confer undue advantage on a political organisation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/5">Most of the other changes consist of clarifications and re-ordering to make the code more coherent. One change that has attracted some comment is the proposal to remove paragraph 12 of the code, which refers to the need to be open and frank with Ministers, Members and officials. We suggest that it should be included in a new paragraph 13, which would also cover the declaration and registration of interests in the House. That would make it clear that Members should</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/6">&#8220;always be open and frank in drawing attention to any relevant interest in any proceeding of the House or its House or its Committees, and in any communications with Ministers, Members, public officials or public office holders.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/7">That is a clarification rather than a substantive change. Its roots lie in one of the more painful cases that the Committee has had to consider: the so-called Lobbygate, in which Members were drawn into discussing jobs that they might undertake after they had left the House. One of the cases arising from that involved the failure of my good friend Mr Richard Caborn to declare an interest in a meeting with the chairman of a health authority. At the time, it was argued that the rules governing declaration did not cover such cases, as the person concerned was not a Minister or a civil servant. Our judgment was that the spirit of the rules was clear: their purpose was to ensure that Members were transparent in their dealings with people who might be in a position to influence public policy or the spending of public money. However, we believed that the rules could be better expressed, and these changes achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/8">One of the great sadnesses involved in dealing with standards cases is that we must deal with what comes before us. The Committee cannot simply refuse to look into a matter because it was a case of entrapment or a single transgression in a distinguished career, and there are a limited number of sanctions that it can recommend to the House. It is a mark of the respect and affection in which Richard Caborn is held that extremely senior people have asked the Committee to reconsider his case. We have considered the matter carefully on more than one occasion, but ultimately we decided that we had considered the rules carefully at the time of our original finding.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/9">It may help, however, if I discuss some of the matters that were set out clearly in the original report and debate. The commissioner and the Committee agreed that the breach of the rules was inadvertent. As I said at the time, the penalty that we proposed was</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/10">&#8220;intended to be light, because we recognised that Mr Caborn did not intend to breach the rules or to bring the House or its Members generally into disrepute.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/11">An inadvertent slip should not obscure Mr Caborn&#8217;s long record of distinguished public service, and I hope that it does not do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">As one of those who made representations to my right hon. Friend on behalf of my former colleague the then Member of Parliament for Sheffield, Central, I welcome the tenor and nature of his speech. Does he agree that in future, and specifically in the guidance that is to be offered, there should be absolute transparency about the operation of the Committee and about basic rules of fairness? For instance, should the guidance not make clear what is a constituency matter and what is not?

	<p pid="a.91.1/1">I do not want to go into any great detail, but the changes in the code are intended to do precisely that. They are intended to clarify areas so that they are not open to interpretation&#8212;or, some would argue, misinterpretation&#8212;in years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.1/2">The code does not need radical revision, but it does need to evolve to meet the changing expectations and circumstances of not just the House of Commons but</p>
	<p pid="a.91.1/3">the public outside, and, as I have said, it needs to be as clear as possible. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the commissioner for his thorough consideration of the code and the work that he has done to produce a clearer, more coherent document, which I commend to the House. I hope that those who tabled the amendment will reconsider their position, but we will be able to revisit it. The guidance will reassure the House that no commissioner will be able to forage into areas that would be unfair on Members of Parliament, and I hope that that will be acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.1/4">I also hope that the second motion will prove entirely uncontroversial. It introduces an additional register to record the interests of those who provide secretariats for all-party groups. It will deal with an anomaly between the registration requirements for staff of all-party groups and those for Members&#8217; staff. It will make the arrangements easier to administer, and will reduce the risk that, owing purely to inadvertence, interests will not be registered. The proposal is the result of a paper from the Registrar of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, and the Committee is grateful to her for it. The staff of all-party groups are currently required to register only income from employment, whereas secretaries and research assistants are also required to register gifts, benefits and hospitality. The motion proposes that the registration requirements should be the same for both groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.1/5">The motion also proposes the transferring of the requirement to register to the staff member from the Member who is the registered contact for the all-party group, who may not be closely involved in the group&#8217;s administration. That would make it easier to ensure that the registration requirements are complied with, as the relevant forms can be issued with pass applications, and it will not be necessary for an officer of the group to take such action. As Members may know, the Speakers of the two Houses have set up a bicameral working group to consider all-party groups. I am a member of it, as are others who are in the Chamber this evening. There may be more changes to come, but there is no need for us to delay this change.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.1/6">I trust that the House will approve my modest proposal to streamline and tighten the registration requirements for staff of all-party groups. Indeed, I hope that it will agree to both motions. I look forward to ending any misgivings relating to one of the reports at a later stage in our proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron)</phrase>. Let me begin by paying tribute to the work of his Committee and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. A great deal of thought has gone into their review, and much of what is suggested makes perfect sense. However, my amendment seeks to address and limit the no doubt well-intentioned recommendation that will allow the commissioner to broaden his remit into investigating and adjudicating on Members&#8217; conduct in their wider private and personal lives. I believe that that proposed intrusion into Members&#8217; private and personal lives is a step too far, and I am worried about where it may lead the commissioner and the House if left unamended.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">Justifying an extension of the commissioner&#8217;s powers, the Committee states on page 11 of its report, paragraph 2, that</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">&#8220;The Code does not seek to regulate the conduct of Members in their purely private and personal lives or in the wider conduct of their public lives unless such conduct significantly damages the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole or of its Members generally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">If deconstructed, however, that statement, far from limiting the new powers of the commissioner in the area of Members&#8217; private and personal lives, gives him almost unlimited scope to investigate any action committed in this space on the basis that it is potentially damaging to the reputation of Parliament and its Members. A less generous, but accurate, interpretation of paragraph 2, page 11, would read as follows: &#8220;The code will seek to regulate the conduct of Members of Parliament in their purely private and personal lives, if it is the view of the commissioner and the Committee that their actions could be deemed significantly to damage the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, or of its Members generally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">I worry about where this new activism by the commissioner might lead. Over the weekend, I wracked my brain to try and imagine scenarios in Members&#8217; private lives that would trigger the interest of the commissioner, and I could only come up with two topics: the bedroom and the bottle. In common with most people, these are the two weaknesses that seem most likely to compromise Members of Parliament in their private lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/6">On page 24 of the report, the commissioner argues that his interest is warranted on the basis that</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/7">&#8220;a Member of Parliament is never off duty. Once elected, a serving Member is likely always to be seen as a Member of Parliament, with the duties and obligations that go with that position, wherever they are and whatever they are doing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/8">I dispute that view. Despite living in his constituency full-time, the Member of Parliament for Broxbourne&#8212;namely, myself&#8212;is, on occasion, most certainly off duty, and be assured, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I were not off duty on occasions, I would slowly, but surely, go mad. Perhaps that point has already been reached.</p>

A Member might have had a private meeting, perhaps with another family member who was a businessman, and in which there was a discussion about funding and payment. During that meeting, the Member might have utilised his position as a Member, and that might have become public knowledge, although the meeting was private. I am sympathetic to where my hon. Friend wants to go, but I am bothered that we have not looked at this issue properly and I would like him to consider putting his point but&#8212;as the Committee Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.94.0/1">May I return to the theme I was developing earlier, in what was described as a very long intervention&#8212; I shall try to be briefer this time? The commissioner suggests that some of the new rules might be split. We used to have rule 2, stating that the rules do not</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">&#8220;seek to regulate what Members do in their purely private and personal lives&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/3">whereas rule 16 said Members must not bring the House into disrepute, which was, in a sense, a mop-up rule. Matters are set out in a more coherent way now, but there is no real change.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/1">I disagree with my hon. Friend about that. The commissioner is clearly trying to give himself powers to investigate Members&#8217; private and personal lives, which is why this amendment has been tabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/2">The commissioner&#8217;s interpretation of a Member&#8217;s status is at odds with that of another regulatory body, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which states in its consultations and press releases that a fundamental principle of its scheme is that MPs</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/3">&#8220;should be treated&#8230;as far as possible like other citizens.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/4">The various regulatory bodies that oversee and adjudicate on our activities cannot reasonably expect to have it both ways. The public now rightly demand that Members of Parliament should face the same rigours that they do in their daily lives. The flipside of that must be that parliamentarians, &#8220;like other citizens&#8221;, also have the right to a private life and private space&#8212;and in this private space people will, on occasions, make mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/5">It is in the nature of our job&#8212;this vocation&#8212;that if these mistakes are large enough, they will be picked up and reported by the press, with all the opprobrium, shame and upset that goes with having our private calamities played out on a national stage. I look back at the personal agonies that the former hon. Members for Croydon Central and Winchester went through in the last Parliament, and I shudder to think how much worse things would have been for them if the parliamentary commissioner, however well intentioned, had been conducting his own forensic investigation into their actions, dragging in family, friends and perhaps other aggravating parties. There would have been months and months of investigation, all in the name of protecting the notional honour of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/6">The Committee does not dismiss the possibility of such investigations. It offers a well-meaning but vague assurance on page 6 of its report that</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/7">&#8220;like the Commissioner, we do not think the Committee or the House should be drawn into judging a Member's purely private and personal relationships.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/8">Why is that sentence not worded more forcefully? Why does it equivocate when it could say that &#8220;the commissioner and the Committee will not allow the House to be drawn into judging a Member&#8217;s purely private and personal relationships&#8221;? Why is that assurance not given by the commissioner and the Committee? The reason, I believe, is that it cannot be given because the commissioner knows full well that, almost exclusively, personal scandals and misfortunes are where the action lies.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.0/1">In his usual helpful way, the broad-minded Leader of the House made it clear in his response to the consultation that he was not aware of any recent cases where a Member&#8217;s conduct in their purely private and personal life had been so outrageous that the House or the general public would have wanted action to be taken against the Member. Those pushing this proposal cannot come up with any sensible examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">The Leader of the House has been in this place for almost 40 years, but while it seems he cannot think of anything worth investigating, the commissioner clearly can. That is why he is promoting this change to the current code of conduct.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.1/1">This issue boils down to how the provisions are drafted. No one has any serious doubt about the intentions and the parameters, but problems do arise. The code states that it does not</p>

	<p pid="a.95.1/3">I emphasise that word&#8212;&#8220;private and personal lives&#8221;, or in the conduct of their wider lives. Rule 16, however, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">&#8220;Members shall never undertake any action which would cause significant damage.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/5">Therefore, on the one hand we are told the code does not seek to &#8220;regulate&#8221;, yet on the other hand we are told Members shall &#8220;never&#8221; undertake certain actions. I do not think there is any real doubt about what is intended, but I am worried about the interpretation that might be drawn if this proposal is passed. That is the problem. This is more an issue of drafting than of intention.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">My hon. Friend leads me into the final part of my speech. Let us be clear that however well intentioned the power the commissioner is seeking, it will mean that Members&#8217; private and personal lives will be in the ambit of investigation. Their actions will be scrutinised by the commissioner and a subjective view will be taken of whether or not those actions could cause significant damage to the reputation of the House. Every sexual peccadillo, domestic dispute or unguarded cross word would lead to tabloid calls for the commissioner to take action&#8212;&#8220;Something must be done&#8221;, the headlines will cry. The commissioner argues that in the event of an undefined personal scandal, the House&#8217;s status would be diminished if it</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/2">&#8220;were unable to take action to express its disapproval and uphold its standards in such circumstances.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/3">In a sense, that sounds like a return, after 17 years, to &#8220;back to basics&#8221;. We know what a disaster that was; we had all these moral judgments applied to the activities of Members. The one example that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40406" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> did provide would be covered by criminal law in any case, so it is not relevant to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/4">In conclusion, I am fully aware that Members of Parliament can do bad and unethical things in their capacity as Members of Parliament, which is why these standards and the code of conduct are so important. As importantly, I am also aware that people can do silly and stupid things regardless of who they are, because none of us was born an angel or a saint. So I strongly believe that the House should confine itself to worrying about the matters that directly pertain to the job of being an elected representative, and not those that relate to general human weakness or stupidity. For that reason, I urge the House, the right hon. Member for Rother Valley, for whom I have a huge amount of time, and my hon. Friends the Members for North East Hertfordshire (Oliver Heald) and for Mole Valley, of whom I am extraordinarily fond, despite our little spat this evening, to support my amendment. On this occasion, it is time that the House recognised that the Member of Parliament for Broxbourne is arguing for the virtuous and should carry the day.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.1/1">We welcome the review of the code of conduct by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the report by the Committee on Standards and Privileges commenting on the draft code and the changes that the commissioner has suggested. May I also say at the outset that Labour supports the changes that he has suggested for all-party groups?</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2">As the Committee notes, the code was last revised in 2005 and several areas of it could be usefully clarified, so there is much that we welcome in the review. It is sensible that the code of conduct has remained one of high-level principles, rather than detailed rules. As the chairman of Standards for England noted in his consultation response, there is a danger that having a set of rules</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/3">&#8220;which is too tightly defined can lead to a complexity which makes understanding of the rules too difficult to grasp which is therefore counter-productive&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">We welcome the fact the commissioner has rejected such an overly prescriptive rules-based approach. There is much that we can welcome in the report, so rather than go into great detail about that, I wish to concentrate on areas where we have some concerns, one of which has been pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40129" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/5">Labour Members believe that the existing code of conduct is working well. That is not only a tribute to the work done by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron)</phrase> and his Committee, but it is reflected in the responses to the consultation, which did not throw up any major concerns with the status quo. Therefore, any suggestion that the code should be extended into areas not currently covered would need to be backed up by a convincing argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/6">In his consultation, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/7">&#8220;Should the scope of the Code extend to some aspects of a Member&#8217;s private and personal life? If so, how should that be expressed in the Code?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/8">The parliamentary Labour party&#8217;s response to the consultation said no to that, as we feared that it would turn the code of conduct into a code of morals. That remains our view, and we are puzzled by the commissioner&#8217;s recommendation on this point. The proposed revision to the code states:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/9">&#8220;the Code does not seek to regulate the conduct of Members in their purely private and personal lives&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/10">We agree with that approach, because the code should not seek to do that. However, the proposed new code would go on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/11">&#8220;unless such conduct significantly damages the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole or of its Members generally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/12">That is the point that we have all been wrestling with in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/13">That extension appears to suggest that we, as Members of this House, are entitled to a private life&#8212;we are all human, so we are entitled to one under article 8 and the Human Rights Act 1998&#8212;unless the commissioner rules that we are not. As the Leader of the House pointed out in his response to the consultation,</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/14">&#8220;extending the scope of the Code explicitly to cover Members&#8217; private and personal lives could, as you note in the consultation paper, lead to their human rights being infringed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/15">What threshold would result in the code coming into action? We are not told. The commissioner&#8217;s response to the consultation says that it would be &#8220;extremely limited circumstances&#8221; that are</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/16">&#8220;so serious and so blatant&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/17">However, he gives no further indication of what those might be. Such comments cause further confusion, rather than illuminate what the new situation might be. He gives no clues as to what he thinks those circumstances should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/18">So what are these &#8220;extremely limited circumstances&#8221;? Some attempts have been made in the debate to define them, but those have been unsatisfactory. I am sure if we stood on Westminster bridge and canvassed the views of those who passed by, we would find as many views on what those circumstances should be as people we spoke to. The current commissioner may take a narrow view of what constitute his &#8220;extremely limited circumstances&#8221;, but his successor may take a more or</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/19">less narrow view. This is an unsatisfactory situation. The Leader of the House noted in his response to the consultation that we should be</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/20">&#8220;wary of extending the Code to deal with a purely hypothetical eventuality.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/21">I agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/22">As I said at the outset, the existing code is working well. What was needed was tweaking and clarification, not mission creep. Most of the proposed changes to the code are sensible and can easily be supported.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.0/1">I rather agree with what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> was saying earlier. I do not think there is any intention to extend the scope of the code here. The existing code, before the amendments, did not apply to private conduct, but there was a general provision that no Member must act in a way that brought the House into disrepute. This is about clarifying what those two provisions mean in the amended code. I would have thought that that was something that should happen, even if the hon. Lady is not happy with the exact wording.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a particular point, but I do not think that what the commissioner has suggested is clear either and that is what we are struggling with at the moment. I may be alone in this, but I did not think that we faced a problem that needed the kind of revision that has got us into the confusing situation we are now in.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">Members of Parliament are rightly accountable in the courts of law and under the code, as are people in other walks of life. But unlike lawyers, general practitioners or people in any of the other professions, Members of Parliament are accountable at the ballot box for their actions and they are accountable to their political party. The electorate are entitled to make a judgment about a Member&#8217;s private life, and about how effectively they pursue their constituency duty and how they treat their constituents&#8212;that is how democracy works&#8212;but I trust the common sense of the British people to make such judgments; we should leave judgments about morals to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">I welcome the chance to intervene briefly in this interesting debate, and I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron)</phrase> for his speech in moving the motion and for his work on the Committee on Standards and Privileges during his time as Chair, including his work in producing the two reports we are considering today. The House will have noted what he said in response to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40129" name="Charles Walker">the Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/2">I also commend the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, John Lyon, for his work as commissioner. His term of office concludes at the end of this year, and it is possible that this will be the last debate on the work of his office, in general terms, during it. He has faced a work load that neither he nor anyone else could have foreseen when he was first appointed, he has discharged his responsibilities conscientiously and effectively and been a source of wisdom and good sense for the Committee on Standards and Privileges and its successive Chairs. I say that with added conviction as the Chair at the time of his appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/3">The review of the code that the commissioner has carried out reflects the experience he has gathered during his term. The overwhelming majority of the changes he has proposed represent sensible changes, improving the clarity and structure of the code without affecting its overall scope and meaning. In particular, the changes help to distinguish the aspirational parts of the code from the adjudicable part.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/4">I want briefly to touch on four areas that have attracted particular interest, namely the application of the code to hon. Members&#8217; private lives, the code in relation to constituency responsibilities, personal responsibility for the use of resources and the principle of equal application to all hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/5">On the first matter, the commissioner, the Committee and the House have wrestled, and are wrestling, with the vexed issue of how far the code applies to hon. Members&#8217; private lives, which is the subject of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne and others. In my submission to the review, which has already been quoted, I said that the distinction between private and public lives was</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/6">&#8220;important, even if it is not always clear&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/7">I noted that an extension to private lives might lead to an infringement of human rights, a point also made in the submission by the chair of Standards for England.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/8">I further pointed out that any such extension</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/9">&#8220;could also be used to justify intrusive and prurient media interest in Members&#8217; private lives, on the basis that if the House chooses to concern itself with Members&#8217; personal lives&#8212;however sparingly&#8212;then there should be no limits to the media doing likewise&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.0/1">As my right hon. Friend will know, the code must be read as a whole. Has he had time to look at paragraph 18, which provides:</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/2">&#8220;The Commissioner may investigate a specific matter relating to a Member&#8217;s adherence to the rules of conduct under the Code&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/3">and the following sentence, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/4">&#8220;Members shall cooperate, at all stages, with any such investigation by or under the authority of the House&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/5">If the investigation is into private life, that necessarily means that if a Member refused to answer a question on his or her private life, he or she could be regarded as breaching that part of the code.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-03-12a.99.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40452" speakername="George Young" colnum="99"  time="019:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120312/debtext/120312-0003.htm#12031242000282">
	<p pid="a.99.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right. Once an inquiry has been started by the commissioner, Members are obliged to co-operate and if they do not, they will face consequences from the Committee on Standards. That paragraph would then kick in.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2">The commissioner has concluded that being an hon. Member is a way of life. As he put it, an hon. Member</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/3">&#8220;is never off duty. Once elected, a serving Member is likely always to be seen as a Member of Parliament, with the duties and obligations that go with that position, wherever they are and whatever they are doing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/4">I personally paused at the assertion that I am never off duty, and I think my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne and other colleagues might have had the same reaction. I think that there are times when I am off duty. The commissioner&#8217;s conclusion is that an hon. Member&#8217;s conduct in both their private and wider public lives is excluded from the provisions of the code</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/5">&#8220;unless such conduct significantly damages the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole or of its Members generally&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/6">This is a very high hurdle for investigation, and that approach was endorsed by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/7">The amendment, if the subject of a complaint related only to the conduct of a Member in his or her private and personal life, would have the effect of providing that it could not be investigated. I am confident that the Members who have proposed the amendment have no wish to argue that Members should be subject to special treatment that is not available to others. The issue at stake is simply whether there would ever be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the commissioner to undertake an investigation into a matter that did not intersect at all with an hon. Member&#8217;s conduct in his or her public capacity. That is a matter for the House and each hon. Member to consider and it is not an issue on which it is appropriate for the Government to take a collective view, although I am personally sympathetic to the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/8">The House will also want to reflect on the offer made by the Chair of the Standards and Privileges Committee to take the House&#8217;s concern and address it in the revised guide, which, as I understand it, would leave the code unamended and insert an additional step in the process, in that the Committee would have to agree to the commissioner conducting an inquiry in this particular domain. I am sure that the House will welcome those offers and will want to reflect on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/9">Another potential matter of contention is the application of the code to constituency matters. In his memorandum, the commissioner makes it clear that the way an hon. Member handles constituency business should not be adjudicable by the commissioner, and I agree. He suggests that the House would only wish to consider an instance that was</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/10">&#8220;so serious and blatant as to cause significant damage to the reputation of the House&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/11">I agree that it is very hard indeed to envisage these criteria being met.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/12">On the third issue, in my submission to the review I supported proposals for redrafting the code in line with recommendations by the Committee on Standards in Public Life</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/13">&#8220;so that the House has a clear basis to take action against any Member who has abused the IPSA scheme&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/14">The commissioner proposed to do that by means of a provision that stated that the use of public resources may not confer a political benefit. The Committee on Standards and Privileges has suggested a change, arising from its observation that it is unrealistic to expect that parliamentary activities legitimately funded from the political purse might never confer an indirect political benefit. The new code rightly makes it clear that Members should be clear that the use of public resources must always be in support of their parliamentary duties and should not confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves or anyone else or confer undue advantage on a political organisation. I agree that that formulation is in line with the original proposals of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which used the phrase &#8220;undue advantage&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/15">Finally, the commissioner considered and rejected a number of proposals that would involve separate rules for hon. Members who were former Ministers or who were Opposition Front Benchers. He did so on the basis that of the principle that</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/16">&#8220;the Code should apply equally to all Members&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/17">That is a principle that I wholeheartedly support.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/18">The second motion, as the right hon. Member for Rother Valley said, is more straightforward. It seeks the approval of the twenty-first report from the Committee on Standards and Privileges, which recommends extending the scope of registration to individual staff of all-party groups who hold passes and to transfer the onus of registration from the registered contact of the group to the staff member him or herself. As my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House stated in the debate on all-party groups on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-07">7 February</phrase> last year, all-party groups can play a valuable role provided they are transparent. That measure seems sensible and does not represent an abdication of responsibility by hon. Members who are officers of all-party groups. Instead, it reflects the proper situation whereby individuals who have the benefits of being a pass holder in this place should personally accept the responsibilities that flow from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/19">I look forward to the rest of the debate and to the House coming to a decision on these vexed matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">With the leave of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, before the amendment is pressed, I ask Members to remember my offer to look at the code of conduct and ensure that any commissioner&#8212;this current one or any in the future&#8212;would have to come to the House before considering any of the issues referred to in the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">The current code states in paragraph 15:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3">&#8220;Members shall at all times conduct themselves in a manner which will tend to maintain and strengthen the public&#8217;s trust and confidence in the integrity of Parliament and never undertake any action which would bring the House of Commons, or its Members generally, into disrepute.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">There is no mention in that paragraph of personal and private lives, or, indeed, of public lives, although they are mentioned in other parts of the code. The provision has never been enacted in such a way and I fear that if the House goes down the route of accepting that people&#8217;s personal and private lives are not covered by the code of conduct, that will be a step back. It seems to me that the House would be better advised to consider the genuine proposals that any body wanting to look into someone&#8217;s private and personal life would have to come to the Committee to do so. This House should have confidence in its Members who sit on Committees and in the fact that we have an independent commissioner whom we appoint, whose terms and conditions we set and who is independent of us. It should have confidence in a Select Committee on Standards and Privileges that operates in a non-party political way that was unanimous in saying</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/5">we should accept the paper before us. We certainly are not unanimous in accepting the amendment. The House should have confidence in itself that if the commissioner or the Committee ever did something wholly wrong, the House could reject that.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/6">Let me finish by saying to hon. Members, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> on the Front Bench, who mentioned morals, that this is not about morals. I can tell the House, as the Chairman of the Committee, that if the commissioner came to me with a report about morals I would go around the Committee first before I would discuss the memorandum before us. It is not something we should do or that would be acceptable to Parliament or the general public. However, there are circumstances and occasions on which Members have gone overboard but have not been covered by the code. I genuinely think it would be wrong for us to agree to the amendment today. We can look at the guidance and these issues more widely if needs be, but what is proposed would be a backward step. If the amendment is accepted the code will be weaker than the code I have in my hand. I genuinely think we should not do that.</p>

This will involve detailed consideration by the Regulatory Reform Committee followed by proceedings on the Floor of the House, with the nature of those proceedings reflecting the views of the Committee. The proposals follow consultation with the Liaison Committee, the Procedure Committee and the official Opposition. No objections have been voiced to the proposed method of proceeding. I have also spoken to the Chair of the Regulatory Reform Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">the hon.

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I am most grateful for that endorsement.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">I shall confine my remarks to two matters&#8212;the drafting of the Standing Orders and an account of how the procedures will work. As I have already admitted, the proposals before us are complex, but the complexity flows from the complexity of the current provisions in <phrase class="standing-order" code="141">Standing Order No. 141</phrase>. An earlier version of the motion on which I consulted was even more complex</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">and I was asked to describe this version of the motion as the &#8220;simplified&#8221; one. Although I am confident that this motion will work, and its provisions are explained in further detail in an explanatory memorandum, I am not convinced that it is as simple as the House would wish. The Procedure Committee has indicated a willingness to consider the overall approach enshrined in <phrase class="standing-order" code="141">Standing Order No. 141</phrase> and in the new Standing Order, and I know the Regulatory Reform Committee will also have an interest in the matter. If those Committees were to propose a simpler approach that delivered the same outcome, I believe it would be welcomed by the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">The nature of the order-making powers covered by the motion is described in the explanatory memorandum, so I shall not describe them now. Because the powers are broad and can involve change to primary legislation, the Localism Act 2011 provides for enhanced scrutiny arrangements, including a so-called super-affirmative procedure, by direct application of or by analogy with the scrutiny arrangements under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. Commons Standing Orders currently assign the additional scrutiny powers under the 2006 Act to the Regulatory Reform Committee and we propose that the Committee should have the same role in respect of the new orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">The Committee&#8217;s powers are extensive. It considers the merits of each order and the appropriateness of the proposed method of proceeding. It can conclude that a particular measure should not be proceeded with or should be subject to different proceedings. Its conclusions help to determine the procedures that are then followed on the Floor of the House. The motion enables the House to consider the new orders in the same way as orders under the 2006 Act. The proposals are complex and we have an open mind on their being simplified in due course. For the immediate future, to enable proper scrutiny to take place, I commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">The motion establishes the arrangements necessary for enacting the necessary scrutiny by this House of certain orders and draft orders. It is my understanding that the Liaison Committee attempted to find a simpler method for such scrutiny but could not arrive at a satisfactory way forward. It is therefore necessary to adopt the procedure used by the Regulatory Reform Committee for the scrutiny of these orders. The procedure is complicated, as Members will realise, but Members also recognise that effective scrutiny is important. On that note, will the Deputy Leader of the House confirm that the Government will be willing to review the arrangements if weaknesses in these arrangements become apparent?</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">We do not object to the adoption of Regulatory Reform Committee arrangements for the scrutiny of orders and draft orders arising from the provisions of the Localism Act 2011. That is not to say that we have changed our view of the Localism Act. We voted against it on Third Reading and think it wrong that the Secretary of State should have gathered so many extra powers to himself via its provisions&#8212;142 in fact. However, the Act is now passed into law and, on the scrutiny of some of the actions arising from its provisions, we have no objection to the adoption of arrangements that mirror exactly the procedures followed by the Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">I am pleased that the House has disposed of its business rapidly so that we can have a proper debate on Travellers in Poole, Bournemouth and Dorset. In a minute, one or two of my colleagues might run into the Chamber having been caught by the collapse of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">Before I start, let me say that I have just emerged from hospital, having had appendicitis, and I would like to thank Oliver Allenby-Smith, his team and all the nurses on ward B4 of Poole hospital, who have been nursing me for five days. I am now on the mend and able to represent here my constituents in Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">We all recognise the importance of making provision for Travellers. My experience throughout my political career is that if we make proper provision we have the legal powers to move people on from inappropriate places. It was a retrograde step when the John Major Government decided to move away from paying for pitches, because that diminished the infrastructure for many of the Traveller sites and has caused us problems ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/4">The difficulty in Dorset is that in 1996 Bournemouth and Poole both realised their aspirations of becoming unitary authorities again, and therefore strategic authorities. However, consideration was not given to the boundaries of either authority, so both remained fairly tightly drawn. From central Poole or central Bournemouth one can get to rural Dorset in about 10 or 15 minutes, so there is logic in having a policy for Travellers that encompasses not only Dorset county council, but the two other strategic authorities, Poole and Bournemouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/5">Under the Housing Act 2004 Poole undertook a review of the housing need of Travellers. It carried out a consultation on the number of sites and came up with 20. It reduced that to three sites within its boundaries. One of the joys of having a local authority with no overall control is that the committee then decided to consult on all 20 sites. So I have many concerned and worried constituents who think they may well have a Travellers site in their own back yard.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/6">I would like more co-ordination and co-operation among the three authorities. They all want to work together, but there are certain things that are causing a problem. One of the issues relates to policing, which does not impact directly on the Department for Communities and Local Government. The issue of joint transit provision is not one that strategic authorities are able to consider because the Criminal Justice Act 2004 does not give the police powers to move Travellers across strategic authority boundaries. In Dorset, joint provision between lower-tier authorities is possible because under Dorset county council the higher tier is the strategic authority. Poole and Bournemouth do not have this opportunity because they themselves are both strategic authorities. Those authorities therefore have to provide facilities within area. That is not necessarily an easy fix. It seems bizarre that Dorset has one police force, the Dorset constabulary, yet under the law as it relates to policing, the force cannot move Travellers across Poole, Bournemouth or Dorset because they have to be unitary authorities. That needs to be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/7">I would like a Minister to set out when we are likely to get the Travellers review. It would be helpful to see what obligations the local authority has. Does the Localism Act 2011, which introduced the duty of co-operation in plan-making, set out whether that will override other duties? What we need is co-operation among the three authorities. It is logical and it follows from our history and our geography that they should work together. Both Bournemouth and Poole are happy to make their contribution in financial terms, but the very tight geographical boundaries that both have make it extremely difficult to identify sites which do not have another purpose. In my constituency in Poole, for example, the only green area we have is Parkstone golf club. To the west is water, and to the north is an area of outstanding natural beauty and green belt, so identifying an efficient site within Poole will be extremely difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/8">Then there are the issues of permanent sites and transit sites. It is important that there should be transit sites. The advantage of Poole is that the transit site could easily be only a few miles up the road in rural Dorset, yet at present we seem to be precluded from taking action. I should like more information on what is envisaged. Earlier this year the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> replied to a written question on Travellers from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>. My right hon. Friend said that he understood that there was widespread concern about rules and guidance on Travellers sites. He stated that the Department for Communities and Local Government had published the new draft planning policy for Travellers sites for consultation in April 2011, but I still do not think we have clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/9">On a number of occasions I, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole and my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth West (Conor Burns) and for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) have tried to pin the Government down to give us more specifics, but the Government have not been able to do so. The situation is difficult. Logic demands a collaborative approach among Dorset, Poole and Bournemouth in discharging our duties towards Travellers. We have not been able to do so because of slight legal impediments, the police impediment that I set out, and the lack of clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/10">I hope that the Minister will be able to set out clearly the requirements under the Localism Act 2011. I had great hopes of the Act. This is the great new dawn for local government. The Act specifically introduces a duty to co-operate in plan-making, although there are no definitions of what the duty consists of. The authorities are meant to come together to agree a plan strategically. This is, in effect, what is happening between the three strategic authorities, Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole, with the joint Gypsy and Traveller work. However, that does not mean that we can offload our responsibility to provide appropriate sites, and we would not wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/11">We are in a state of flux. The borough council wants to do the right thing, but because there is no overall control, it has consulted on too many sites and there are many worried people. Our geography and our history mean that identifying appropriate sites is very difficult. As I stated, we went from 20 sites down to three and</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/12">consulted on the three. One of the three sites under serious consideration, which was in the Branksome triangle, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West, is already being used for car parking for Liverpool Victoria and is therefore in employment use. It is very difficult for us to identify a site that could be used as a permanent or a transit site without losing employment land. We want to do the right thing, but that is extremely difficult because of our history and our geography. That is why I hope for some answers from the Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">I agree. That is an important point. As a local politician, I am trying to get some certainty, as I am sure is my hon. Friend, so that there is a much clearer sense of direction. Therefore, we need a few more answers from Ministers. If we do not get them tonight, clearly we might need to have further meetings with the Minister concerned. The uncertainty means that people are becoming much more worried than they need to be, not least because Poole is consulting on rather too many sites, some of which are not appropriate, and worrying a lot of people. My postbag is filling up with letters from people who have genuine concerns, as I am sure is my hon. Friend&#8217;s. Poole wants to do the right thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">One thing that is causing considerable anxiety locally is the fact that our councils are being forced to do the consultation that they are now undertaking. My understanding is that the consultation is part-funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government and that it is a central Government requirement on local government. The point my hon. Friend made a moment ago about definition and clarity around the Localism Act 2011 is extremely important in relation to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I think that the 2011 Act is a landmark piece of legislation, and we have high hopes that it will transform local government. He is right that we need a little more clarity on whether it will offset some of the other requirements that the Government have put on Poole. We want to do the right thing and provide sufficient sites. We want to provide what we have a duty to provide and to pay for it, but the difficulty is that he and I have extremely compact constituencies. It is difficult to find appropriate sites in our constituencies, yet there might be appropriate sites five or 10 minutes away from the conurbation. However, because we have unitary and strategic authorities it is very difficult to do that and leave Dorset constabulary in a situation where it can move Travellers on if it has to.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/2">I know that Bournemouth has problems with Travellers on occasion and a number of temporary sites to deal with them at certain times of the year. Later in the debate I would be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West set out his constituents&#8217; concerns on what is a difficult and worrying subject, but</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/3">one on which we as politicians need to get more clarity. Essentially, we want three authorities to work together on this, which is the whole thrust of the 2011 Act and which they want to do. We want to combine financially and make provision for Travellers in the appropriate way; the most appropriate way might be for the three authorities to make that provision on a collective basis. That might mean not necessarily having the sufficient number of sites within the boundaries of Bournemouth or Poole.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/4">We need more clarity, and I hope that we will get it from the Minister. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West has similar views and concerns to me and I would be interested to hear them, so that the Minister may reply with conviction and give us more reassurance on this very difficult policy issue that our local councillors have to comply with. That is really all I have to say. I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> in his place and am sure that he will respond brilliantly to the debate. If we do not get the answer we demand tonight, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West and I will look forward to further meetings with Ministers so that we can meet our objectives of providing for Travellers, safeguarding our constituents and getting efficient and effective local government.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I begin by again congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">the Member for Poole (Mr Syms)</phrase> on securing this debate and apologise for arriving a moment late. This afternoon I travelled up from the constituency of Bournemouth West, which I have the honour of representing, after attending the opening of a visitor facility in a caf&#233; at the Cherry Tree nursery by Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal. That is relevant to the debate only because the nursery is surrounded by a large amount of greenfield land that has previously been occupied by illegal Gypsy and Traveller encampments, causing enormous distress to the people who work there&#8212;some wonderful young and old people who suffer from severe learning difficulties. The presence of those communities, often unannounced, has been a great source of concern to those people.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">My hon. Friend is putting on the Minister responsible, who is yet to be with us, an extraordinary expectation in hoping that he will respond in detail to all the points that we are making, but I am sure that his colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>, who will reply to the debate, is taking all these points on board. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole went to the heart of the problem we face, which is that the previous Government&#8217;s policy remains in place. Before Christmas I spoke with the head of Gypsy and Traveller policy at the Department for Communities and Local Government, a lady called Nicola Higgins, who confirmed that the previous Government&#8217;s policy is still in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">In the run-up to the most recent general election, we raised our local electorates&#8217; hopes and expectations that the matter would be a priority of the Government who are now in office. Ministers still make the point that the</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">Localism Act 2011 will give our local authorities the powers that they need to get together in groups and remove from them the requirement that each must have their own, separate, single-authority provision. My hon. Friend who secured this debate and I want the Government to complete that unfinished business and to move with some speed to reassuring our local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40105" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase> told the Bournemouth<i> Daily Echo </i>that he had been assured&#8212;according to my hon. Friend, by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>&#8212;that</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">&#8220;once the Localism Bill becomes law, councils will have an opportunity to re-submit their local plans without the obligation to automatically identify gypsy traveller locations.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">In a letter to me, however, the Under-Secretary indicated that</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">&#8220;every local housing authority is required under section 8 of the Housing Act 1985 to carry out an assessment of the accommodation needs of travellers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">The ongoing consultation throughout Dorset is being funded in part by money from the Department, so there is a great urgency about the Government&#8217;s clarification of when the powers that we promised local authorities will become available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Poole mentioned that there are a couple of proposed sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.0/1">The hon. Members for Bournemouth West (Conor Burns) and for Poole (Mr Syms) are making compelling and straightforward arguments, and it is good to see so many Members on the Treasury Bench to hear them, but does the hon. Member for Bournemouth West think that the problem is a lack of transparency or a lack of urgency from the Department?</p>

	<p pid="a.112.1/1">I am delighted to see the hon. Gentleman back in his place after his no doubt successful visit to the Falkland Islands&#8212;and this on Commonwealth day. As he knows, sometimes Governments of all persuasions need a little push, and it is our constituents who are giving us a push as those sites go out to consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">The current consultation, which is being carried out by Baker Associates throughout Dorset and funded to the tune of some &#163;300,000 by the Department, is profoundly unsettling the communities that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole and I serve. One proposed site out to consultation at the moment is Lansdowne, right at the heart of Bournemouth, known locally as the gateway to Bournemouth and visible from the Wessex way.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">As I said in my contribution, the real problem is that Bournemouth and Poole local authorities became unitary without the boundaries being looked at. Both areas are very compact, and finding suitable sites is difficult unless we do so on the basis of the Dorset way.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid and compelling point which I wholly agree with and endorse.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/2">My final point is that those communities, which include some elderly, vulnerable and frail people, are worried that our councils have gone out to consultation on specific sites. There is an excellent campaign being</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/3">run on the Lansdowne site by a lady called Alex De Freitas, who has mobilised local traders and residents to put across their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/4">We really want to hear tonight a compelling answer of some urgency from the Minister as to when our local authorities will be able to move away from that consultation and take up the very sensible powers that they were presented in both governing parties&#8217; pre-election offerings to the British people: the opportunity to come together and to make provision across multiple-authority areas, thereby giving the police the powers to move on the illegal encampments that do so much damage to the communities that my hon. Friend and I serve.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">First, let me say what an unexpected pleasure it is to have the opportunity to address the House on a matter that is of genuine significance and importance to my hon. Friends the Members for Poole (Mr Syms) and for Bournemouth West (Conor Burns), who spoke with eloquence about the situation that they face in Dorset and in their unitary authorities of Poole and Bournemouth. I congratulate the hon. Member for Poole on having secured the debate. I am delighted to respond to at least some of the points that he raised, although he will understand that I may not be able to respond to them all, including those that refer to specific sites and specific planning applications and situations, because ultimately they might finish up on the desk of the Secretary of State, and in those circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to offer a view from the Dispatch Box.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.1/1">May I say how very pleased I am to have my hon. Friend the Minister here replying to the debate? Sometimes greatness is thrust on people at the last minute. I look forward to his response, but my hon.

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">This debate is being conducted in a generosity of spirit that we could perhaps export to other parts of our proceedings at other times.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Poole said that he was disappointed that a previous Government had withdrawn funding for the provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites and expressed the view that that had made the situation more difficult. I remind him that this Government have recently announced a grant programme that will enable some 700 Gypsy and Traveller sites to be refurbished and built across England. There is still some money left in the fund, and we are open to receiving bids for the provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites to take advantage of that funding. I understand his point about the added difficulty created by the various planning constraints that arise if it is also thought that significant amounts of money have to be spent, but the Government have responded to that. I appreciate his request for the Government to provide additional encouragement for the three authorities to work together, particularly in the potential co-ordination of police action. I will come to those points in a few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3">I want to make it clear that the Government are committed to encouraging sustainable development, and it is extremely important that local authorities plan for the future of their communities, within which there will be Gypsies and Travellers. My hon. Friend will be aware that the Government have taken steps to abolish the regional spatial strategies, and we have published the draft national planning policy framework on which a consultation has concluded and on which a further announcement can be expected shortly. That clearly states that local authorities have a duty to provide a housing supply for residents living in their area, including those within the Gypsy and Traveller community. I welcome the fact that both my hon. Friends said that they recognised the commitment to provide sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">I apologise for being a bit delayed in joining the debate, which I was expecting to take place at 10 o&#8217;clock. It is always a delight to start these debates earlier, particularly today, as it gives us another hour and 15 minutes to debate this subject. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Not in an intervention, I am reminded.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">The Minister talked about councils&#8217; obligations to the community. Does he agree that councils also have an obligation to defend and support the green belt, of which they are the custodians for future generations? Three permanent sites inside the green belt have been earmarked for north Bournemouth. This is not against Travellers per se, but against any form of development on the green belt, which is believed to be sacrosanct. Will the Minister endorse the line that councils must be given the duty, responsibility and power to make sure that green belts are protected?</p>

	<p pid="a.114.1/1">I welcome my hon. Friend as another late arrival at the ball tonight. He makes a valid point relating to the consultation that we have carried out on the planning circulars on Gypsies and Travellers. Indeed, he puts his finger on one of the central concerns that led to the initiation of the consultation. I will come on to the next stages of that process in a little while.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/2">There is an obligation on housing authorities to provide for all their residents, including Gypsies and Travellers. They must therefore make an assessment of what that need is and ensure that their local plan includes appropriate sites. The statutory guidance that we inherited implied that different planning rules should apply when sites were being allocated for Gypsies and Travellers. It is that incongruity between the planning constraints on the development of housing for the settled community and for the Gypsy and Traveller community that has often created difficulties and that the consultation is designed to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/3">In providing the funding for new sites, responding to the consultation and developing a new planning framework, we must ensure that we do not simply drive the problem to another place, but that there is adequate provision for Gypsies and Travellers where it is needed. Central to the case of my hon. Friends the Members for Poole and for Bournemouth West is that they want there to be co-operation between the three planning authorities of Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset to ensure that that provision is delivered in the right place in an appropriate and timely fashion. To respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, the Localism Act 2011 places a duty</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/4">to co-operate in planning matters on local authorities. I am sure that he will want to draw that to the attention of the local authorities and ensure that it is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/5">Our aim is for the new draft policy to be short, light touch and fair; to put the provision of sites back into the hands of local councils, in consultation with communities; and to protect green-belt land. We are considering the response to the consultation and intend to publish our new policy as soon as possible. Although this goes a little beyond my brief, the House will understand that that is likely to be linked to the publication of the national planning policy framework. The Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, has put it on record that we intend to publish the framework before the end of this month. I hope that that is some reassurance that we are very close to producing the final version of the policy that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/6">It is important to put it on record that, like the rest of the population, the majority of Travellers are law-abiding citizens. They should have the same chance to have a safe place to live and bring up their children as anybody else. What is not acceptable is for anybody to abuse the planning system, for instance by trespassing and setting up encampments or other unauthorised developments. Another purpose of the planning circular, on which we have consulted and which will be published, is to ensure that some of the rule-bending that has taken place will be ruled out in future. The Government are developing a package of changes, including the use of incentives, through the planning system to provide a better balance between site provision and enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/7">To ensure fair treatment of settled communities and the majority of Travellers, we are putting in place a range of measures including the abolition of the architecture of regional planning through the Localism Act 2011&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] I appreciate my hon. Friends&#8217; support for that measure. We are putting in place stronger enforcement powers for local authorities to tackle unauthorised development and setting out measures to limit the opportunities for retrospective planning permission. My hon. Friends might not be aware that we are setting aside &#163;50,000 to support a training programme run by Local Government Improvement and Development, which is aimed at raising awareness among councillors of their leadership role in relation to Traveller site provision and planning applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">My hon. Friend helpfully says &#8220;Lots.&#8221; I would be quite happy to provide further information, but it will provide councillors with day-long seminars at local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">I have already mentioned that we have included in the Localism Act a duty on local councils to co-operate. That will require them to engage constructively in the planning process. We have included Traveller sites in the new homes bonus, to reward councils that deliver additional</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">sites. That will mean that councils get financial benefits for building authorised Traveller sites where they are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/4">I have mentioned that we have allocated &#163;60 million of Traveller pitch funding to help councils and other registered providers to build new sites. So far I have signed off bids totalling &#163;47 million, which were announced in January and will lead to the setting up of more than 750 new and refurbished pitches for Travellers. Hon. Members may be interested to know that Dorset county council was a successful bidder for &#163;1.75 million of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">It is important to rise above the simple planning context, which is what we have mostly concentrated on, and recognise that the Gypsy and Traveller community suffers a very high level of discrimination and deprivation. It has some of the poorest social outcomes in education, health, access to financial services and of course housing.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.1/1">I fully understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s point, and I hope to get to that in a sentence or two.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/2">I can report to the House that a cross-Government ministerial-level working group has been preparing proposals on how we can address the discrimination and poor social outcomes that Travellers experience. We have applied the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to authorised local authority sites, to give residents of local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites better protection against eviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West has once again brought to the House&#8217;s attention the question of unauthorised developments and what happens next. As a matter of definition, an unauthorised development is land owned by Travellers but developed without planning permission. The Government are getting tough on unauthorised development. We will not tolerate abuse of the planning system by anyone. Local authorities have a range of powers to deal with unauthorised developments, but the fact of the matter is that planning enforcement remains a problem. The powers include temporary stop notices, which do not normally allow the removal of a caravan that is a person&#8217;s main residence. In addition to the measures set out in the Localism Act 2011, the Government are considering strengthening temporary stop notice powers. The measures in the Act include increasing penalties for non-compliance with a breach of condition notice, from a maximum fine of &#163;1,000 to one of &#163;2,500, and limiting the opportunities for retrospective planning in relation to any form of unauthorised development.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/4">Unauthorised encampments&#8212;Travellers trespassing on land not owned by Travellers&#8212;can be tackled not just through the planning system, but through the criminal justice system and civil courts. The police and local authorities have a range of powers to deal with such</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/5">encampments. The full range of powers can be used when an alternative site is available in the local authority area. My hon. Friends have pointed out that because of the tight constraints and small geographical areas of both Poole and Bournemouth, it is difficult to establish the availability of such sites in the local authority areas. Their plea is for the Government to consider widening the scope of that measure, possibly using the duty to co-operate. I have taken note of what they said on that point and undertake to respond to them more fully.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way. With an hour and five minutes left, he has been extremely generous in allowing hon. Members to elaborate on aspects of this important debate. Will he clarify an important issue that affects both Poole and Bournemouth? The regional spatial strategy has been removed and regional development agencies are disappearing, with the 2011 Act replacing them. I understand that Bournemouth borough council now offers in the submission of its core strategy a different paragraph on where Gypsy and Traveller sites can be&#8212;it can make the case that Bournemouth is not appropriate and that those people should be placed elsewhere. Will the Minister confirm that? If he cannot do so now&#8212;I understand that he stepped in for another Minister&#8212;I would be grateful if his Department could write to me.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.1/1">I should make it clear to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I do not feel any deep obligation to keep going for another hour and a quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/2">I would not want my hon. Friend to be too premature. The final version of the national planning policy framework has not yet been published. As I said earlier in my remarks, the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells, has told the House that the intention is that the national planning policy framework should be published before the end of this month. At that</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/3">point, there will also be a statement on how it comes into force. Until that moment, it would not be appropriate for a planning authority to proceed&#8212;indeed, the authority could not proceed, because our proposals of last year have not yet been confirmed. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth East and I might have a reasonable expectation that when the framework is in force, the words he has used would be the appropriate ones to apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">I thank the Minister for responding to this debate. He deserves time off for good behaviour. I am sure that any points that he has not covered can be dealt with later by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">Yes, it has been suggested that I mention that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will be only too delighted to visit the constituency of each Member who has spoken. If it is thought appropriate, I will give that commitment on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/2">We have discussed matters of real significance and importance to the constituents of the Members who have spoken. I do not seek to trivialise that at all. They have generously said that if there are points that I have failed to cover appropriately, they will give my hon. Friend the Minister another chance. On that basis, I hope that the House will be satisfied with my responses and that in due course the matter can be drawn to a full conclusion.</p>
