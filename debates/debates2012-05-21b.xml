	<p pid="b.823.5/1">I have made it clear that police should focus on cutting crime and not on doing paperwork. That is why I have already announced a package of policies that will cut police bureaucracy, saving up to 4.5 million police hours per year, the equivalent of putting more than 2,100 officers back on the beat.</p>

	<p pid="b.823.6/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that the election of police commissioners in six months&#8217; time should allow a much more localised focus on lifting these burdens and enabling more police time to be spent on the front line?</p>

	<p pid="b.823.7/1">I do agree. My hon. Friend makes an important point about the role of police and crime commissioners. They will indeed be the voice of local policing, and I am sure that as such they will want to ensure that police officers are spending as much of their time fighting crime&#8212;and not doing paperwork&#8212;as they can, and that they will be a powerful force in removing bureaucracy from the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.823.8/1">In evidence to the Select Committee, the chief constables of the West Midlands and Surrey informed the Committee that &#163;5 million had been allocated to work with the private sector in order to cut costs and reduce administrative burdens. Given what happened at the Police Federation conference last week, would it not be a good idea for the Home Secretary to sit down with all the stakeholders to discuss exactly what the role of the police should be in the 21st century, rather than there being a public dispute between the Government and the police?</p>

	<p pid="b.823.9/1">I have made it absolutely clear that the focus of the police is on fighting crime. I have set them only one target, which is to cut crime. Indeed, it is right</p>
	<p pid="b.823.9/2">that forces up and down the country are now looking&#8212;as they have done for several years, including under the last Labour Government&#8212;at bringing in the private sector to their forces where they feel that functions can be done more cost-effectively by the private sector. But I have also made it clear&#8212;as I did at the Police Federation conference last week&#8212;that we will not move the powers of warranted officers from officers to the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.824.0/1">One of the most pointless, expensive and time-wasting aspects of the bureaucracy that the police have to deal with is the equality and diversity industry that mushroomed under the last Labour Government, which I saw for myself when I visited West Yorkshire police on Friday. Could I meet the Home Secretary or the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice to discuss how we can streamline this process so that we can get more resources on to the front line?</p>

	<p pid="b.824.1/1">It is entirely right that we encourage the police to see more diversity in their ranks. There are many ways in which we do want to see more women and people from black and minority ethnic communities joining the police force and being able to press through the ranks, but my hon. Friend makes the important point that in looking at these issues we do not want bureaucratic processes to take over. Either I or my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice will meet him to discuss this.</p>

	<p pid="b.824.2/1">Even if I accepted what the Home Secretary said about the changes in administrative burdens, the reality is that 16,000 police officers are being lost. Last week at the Police Federation conference, they told me that 20% cuts would lead to administrative workloads increasing, not decreasing. Only today, the chief constable of Dyfed-Powys warned of &#8220;an austerity crime wave&#8221; as a result of the Government&#8217;s approach to policing. Will the Home Secretary now recognise that despite any package of policies she takes forward on administration, there will be fewer police on the beat and more administrative work to do?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.824.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="824"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0001.htm#1205214000484">
	<p pid="b.824.3/1">No, the whole point of the approach the Government are taking is that we are cutting the bureaucracy for police to enable them to spend more time on the beat. The challenge is this: I was willing to go to the Police Federation conference and be absolutely honest with the police about what we are doing. I trust that the message that the shadow Home Secretary and the shadow policing Minister gave to the police was that Labour Front Benchers support the same level of cuts in funding as the Government are putting through, and the impact that that would have. I wonder if the shadow policing Minister told the police about his view that &#163;600 million should be taken out of police overtime.</p>

	<p pid="b.824.4/1">Exempting the National Crime Agency from the Freedom of Information Act will reduce the administrative burden on the police, but will the Home Secretary set out how the principles of transparency and accountability will be upheld in the way that the NCA operates?</p>

	<p pid="b.824.5/1">I am happy to give my right hon. Friend what I hope will be reassurance on this issue. We are clear that the NCA, when it is set up, should be transparent</p>
	<p pid="b.824.5/2">about how it operates and we will set out clearly those aspects that we expect it to be transparent about and publish information on. However, given the nature of many of the cases that it will deal with and some of the information behind those cases, it is right that we exempt it from the FOI. It is our intention that, on those matters that it can tell the public about, it is as transparent as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.825.6/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. Immigration reform is one necessary element of creating a more balanced labour force, but the other two elements are welfare and educational reform, which will ensure that British workers are trained and have the right attitude to take the jobs available, in agriculture or in other sectors. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Opposition Front-Bench team appear to deride these types of jobs.

	<p pid="b.826.2/1">One of the many failures of the previous Government was that they made settlement an automatic consequence of five years&#8217; residence in the UK. Settlement in the UK is a privilege, not a right, and unrestricted settlement rights are not in the UK&#8217;s best interests. The changes we implemented in April will mean that, from April 2016, those wishing to settle here will have to earn a minimum salary of &#163;35,000 or the appropriate rate for the job, whichever is higher. That is better for the long-term health of our immigration system.</p>

	<p pid="b.826.4/1">I have great admiration for the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s work on immigration and welfare, but I do not think that closing off the European labour market would be appropriate in a recession, because it would presumably apply both ways, meaning that British workers looking for jobs in the rest of the EU would also be badly affected. He is quite right to suggest, however, that the problems of the British economy need to be solved at the same time as the severe problems in the eurozone.</p>

	<p pid="b.826.5/1">My impression is that the fact that companies have never reached the cap in the number of available work permits suggests that it is not the Government-imposed cap that has affected this.

We see responsible businesses coming together with local agencies in a number of towns and cities around the country to provide people with safe drinking places, which will ensure that we can reduce alcohol-related violence and antisocial behaviour. The evidence from many places&#8212;including Durham, for example, which put forward such a plan&#8212;is that such schemes are good for the local economy, as well as for reducing crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.830.5/1">The abuse of article 8 undermines faith not only in our own criminal justice system but in human rights generally, as envisaged by the original British jurists who founded the convention in 1946. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the Government will hold true to the Brighton declaration and make it clear that the sovereignty of our Parliament and our UK courts must be sacrosanct?</p>

	<p pid="b.830.6/1">As my hon. Friend knows, we are making a number of efforts to ensure that the operation of the European convention in relation to the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom courts is as we believe it should be. That does indeed entail the decisions made at the Brighton conference concerning changes in the operation of the European Court of Human Rights. It also involves what we are doing to clarify the fact that article 8 is a qualified right and not an absolute right.</p>

	<p pid="b.830.7/1">There is real concern in my constituency about appeals being lodged under article 8 allowing people to remain in the UK longer without leave to remain. Does my right hon.

	<p pid="b.831.0/1">Yes. That is why the Government will be making changes in the family migration route along with their changes to article 8. Given that article 8 is about the right to a private and family life, the two are relevant to each other. What is crucial, however, is that article 8 is not an absolute right. It is qualified, and it allows the Government to operate a system under which people do not have an automatic right to stay here for the purposes of a family life. We want our courts to operate article 8 in the way in which it is written in the convention.</p>

If they are tied up in red tape, as they were by the last Government, or if they are in back-room positions in which they do not need to be, that is not necessarily the best possible deployment of resources. The latest official figures show that in south Wales overall crime has fallen by 7%, and at the end of last year the chief constable of south Wales said:</p>

	<p pid="b.834.5/1">I thought that the whole point of hosting the Olympics was to try to increase the number of visitors to this country. Our anxiety is not just about the queues now, but about the queues when the Olympics are over. There is one thing that the Minister just does not seem to grasp, so let me ask him a very simple question, which a schoolchild could answer: if it takes 400 passengers 60 minutes to pass through 10 manned controls, how long would it take those passengers to pass through if the number of controls is cut by 20% to eight?</p>

We will have extra people at the border not only up to and during the Olympics, but after the Olympics. I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that his concerns have been fully met.</p>

The current visit visa appeal system costs about &#163;29 million a year to administer&#8212;money that could be much better spent on other parts of the immigration system.</p>

That is what the report says. Time and again, the situation is getting worse month on month, not better. Is not the truth that this is another example of failing border control and weaker action on illegal immigration on the Home Secretary&#8217;s watch? We have controls being downgraded hundreds of times, hundreds of staff being cut and at the last minute re-recruited, drugs and gun checks stopped, and more people like Raed Salah managing to walk through, when they should have been stopped.

We are putting in place a policy that will see the number of people coming into this country reduced and in both the UK Border Agency and the UK Border Force, we are putting right the problems that grew up under the previous Labour Government. She talks about the relaxation of controls, but the inspector said that that had been happening since 2007.

	<p pid="b.840.1/1">First, I assure the hon. Lady that there is not a limit on the number of students coming in.

	<p pid="b.842.6/1">Does the Minister share my concern that the former chief constable of North Yorkshire, having been deemed guilty of serious misconduct, was nevertheless paid &#163;250,000 in compensation when the police authority decided not to extend his contract? Will the Minister take some action to stop the use of public money in this way? How many police officers would &#163;250,000 pay if the money had been used for that instead?</p>

	<p pid="b.843.2/1">The Home Secretary can be proud of the fact that adult victims of human trafficking are being looked after better than ever before, but there remains the scandal that some child victims of human trafficking, instead of being put into special safe homes, are returned to local authority care only to be re-trafficked time and again.

However, those who have expertise in looking after children are, by and large, in local authorities, so that is a natural place for children to be put where they can be kept safely. Where there is the problem of re-trafficking, clearly it is for the Government and for local authorities to look at ways of better protecting children from the traffickers.</p>

	<p pid="b.846.2/1">May I apologise to you and to the House, Mr Speaker, for the absence of the Secretary of State? He is currently travelling back from the north of England, where he has been visiting a number of businesses, and will return to the House later this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.846.2/2">The Beecroft report was commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as part of the red tape challenge and the employment law review. Mr Beecroft was asked to give his initial thoughts on areas of employment law that could be improved or simplified to help businesses and for the purposes of job creation. The report was intended to feed into the work that the Department is carrying out to review employment laws to ensure that they maximise flexibility and reflect modern workplace practices. That is important to employers and employees. The report was designed specifically to strengthen our international competitiveness in difficult economic times. It is worth noting that the UK is considered to have the third most flexible labour market in the OECD. That is good for jobs, and we intend to maintain that situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.846.2/3">Mr Beecroft was asked to take a candid look at a wide range of issues. He submitted his report in October last year. Over the past few months, Ministers have been working on the red tape challenge and the employment law review. We are already actioning 17 of the 23 topics that he raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.846.2/4">On considering the Beecroft report, it was clear that further evidence was required, most notably on the issue of no-fault dismissal for micro-businesses. The call for evidence on that began on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-15">15 March</phrase> and will conclude on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-08">8 June</phrase>. Given that that date falls when the House is not sitting, the Government decided to bring forward publication of the report to this week, so that it could inform the debate. Last week, the Home Secretary announced the outcome of the equalities red tape challenge, which impinges directly on employment and workplace issues. Our intention was therefore to publish the Beecroft report this week, in time for Business, Innovation and Skills oral questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.846.2/5">However, I noticed in the press today that an earlier draft of the report is in circulation. Therefore, in the interests of accuracy and so that the House has the correct information before it, I confirm that I have instructed officials that the report will be published later this afternoon. Copies will be placed in both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.846.2/6">The Government are taking positive action to reform the labour market and to ensure that we can help more people get back to work as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.847.0/1">What a complete and utter shambles! I understand, as the Minister said, that the Secretary of State is in the north-east today. However, will he explain why the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40443" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>, who is responsible for employment relations and is the author of this book</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/2">&#8220;to help you to maximise compensation awards&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/3">in the employment tribunal, is not responding to this question, given that he would appear to be the expert on these matters?</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/4">The Secretary of State has called the Beecroft report, which has been promoted by the Prime Minister, &#8220;bonkers&#8221;. However, on page 3 of the report, Mr Beecroft says that he owes a &#8220;debt of gratitude&#8221; to the deputy director of labour law at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, who helped to produce it. Will the Minister confirm that his Department was complicit and fully co-operated in the production of the report, despite the misgivings of the Secretary of State?</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/5">We agree that improvements can be made to the way in which employment tribunals operate, for the sake of employees and employers, but we do not think that watering down people&#8217;s fundamental rights at work is a substitute for a growth strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/6">The Secretary of State has said that there is a &#8220;reasonably good balance&#8221; between workers&#8217; rights and employers&#8217; flexibility. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor, however, suggest that the balance has gone too far in favour of employees. Will the Minister tell us who is determining Government policy in this area&#8212;his boss or his ultimate masters in Downing street?</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/7">On growth, Beecroft suggests that his recommendations will solve all our problems. However, the double-dip recession that we are in is not a consequence of people&#8217;s right not to be unfairly dismissed or of our employment law regime; it is a consequence of the huge drop in demand that has flowed from the loss of business and consumer confidence caused by the Government&#8217;s policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/8">Is it not the case that putting people in fear of being fired at will, far from promoting growth, will have a huge detrimental impact on consumer confidence? I ask that because Mr Beecroft proposes to give businesses of fewer than 10 employees the power to fire at will through compensated no-fault dismissal. That could affect more than 3.6 million workers in the private sector. Mr Beecroft said:</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/9">&#8220;The downside of the proposal is that some people would be dismissed simply because their employer did not like them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/10">That, he said, was &#8220;a price worth paying&#8221;. That is wrong. Does the Minister agree?</p>
	<p pid="b.847.0/11">Does not the noise from Government around this report demonstrate what our business leaders have made very clear: that the Government have lost the plot on growth? Having sought to blame British businesses for the lack of growth, with Ministers telling firms to stop &#8220;whingeing&#8221; and to &#8220;work harder&#8221;, the Government now want to blame the hard-working employees in those businesses for the mess that they created. The truth is that they have run out of excuses for tipping the country into a double-dip recession. Everyone wants them to change course to get more people into work. That is what they should concentrate on, not on making it easier to do precisely the opposite.</p>

	<p pid="b.848.0/1">A lot of clich&#233;s but not a lot of substance, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="b.848.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asked whether I was complicit in the production of the report. If he had listened to what I said in my statement, he would have heard that the Department commissioned the report. He can use the term &#8220;commissioned&#8221; or &#8220;complicit&#8221;, but we still want to check what everyone says.</p>
	<p pid="b.848.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked where the employment relations Minister is. He is in the west country, speaking to and working with postal workers, who are keen to hear his views, and so he should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.848.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about the quote including the word &#8220;bonkers&#8221;. Let us just clarify that, shall we? What the Secretary of State said was that the way in which the current working time directive works is bonkers, and he was right. It operates in such a way as to prevent hard-working people from earning more money. I have no problems in supporting the Secretary of State on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.848.0/5">The hon. Gentleman then turned to the question of how to develop an economy that can grow more jobs. He may not have spotted the fact that 600,000 new jobs have been created in the past 20 months. There is no simple magic solution, and Government Members understand that although Mr Beecroft has his views, there are others, and we want to listen to them. That is why we have issued a call for evidence and want to consider that evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.848.0/6">Last week, I had the privilege of meeting the work force at Vauxhall, where there are to be 700 additional jobs, with a potential 4,000 extra jobs in the supply chain. Why? Because the staff there are prepared to be flexible and work on a modern basis. It is a shame that the Labour party does not understand that.</p>

	<p pid="b.848.2/1">I do not have a specific estimate, and that is why we have issued a call for evidence. My right hon. Friend is right to ask about that issue, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> unfortunately did not mention. We need to understand that there is a cost to every regulatory measure that is brought forth, not only economically but for people on the edge of the labour market who want the chance to have a job. If we regulate them out of work, we have to take responsibility for that, so my right hon. Friend is right to reflect on the costs.</p>

Flexibility in labour markets is a good thing, but does he accept that what is really stopping companies hiring is the lack of confidence in economic prospects in this country and the eurozone? In that context, are not the proposals fiddling while Athens burns?</p>

Government Departments are working hard on those things&#8212;they are all important&#8212;but he is right that we need to ensure we get the appropriate balance.

	<p pid="b.857.5/1">A few years ago I ran a small company with 20 employees. One of them was grossly inefficient and incompetent. That person was highly unpopular and should have gone, but I was unable to remove them. It cost a great deal of money and effort, and in the end I failed. I hope that we will get legislation that allows good employers to deal with people like that.</p>

	<p pid="b.857.6/1">The whole point is to ensure that the balance between the employer and employee is struck in a way that enables us to resolve exactly that kind of dispute.

We need to ensure that they have the opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="b.857.7/1">The Minister talks about introducing new practices. I would suggest that he is actually reintroducing some pretty old practices, in allowing someone to be dismissed because someone does not like their face. Will he reflect on what he is saying today and think seriously about whether he wants to return to the really bad old days, when people were summarily dismissed for no apparent reason?</p>

	<p pid="b.858.1/1">Is the Minister aware that 70% of the micro-business community are sole traders?

	<p pid="b.858.5/1">When I worked in a large company, it was difficult at times to do what was best for it because of the employment restrictions and the advice of lawyers. Let me provide an example. When we had a redundancy programme, several people were asked to be put out of its scope because of risk, which was unfair on the people who were not in certain special groups as determined by the lawyers. It is that kind of complexity that we need to remove to ensure that employers do what they do best&#8212;providing British jobs and growing the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.859.0/1">Some critics of the Government policy to let parents choose how they share parental leave have a view of family life that is, frankly, stuck in the 1950s. They fail to take account of the benefits to business of employing mothers who might be able to return to work more quickly or the benefits to the wider economy of giving parents the flexibility to play a fuller role in the labour market. Whatever is in this report, will the Minister confirm that the Government are committed to introducing shared parental leave, with the benefits it will bring both to families and the economy?</p>

	<p pid="b.859.2/1">Is it not a totally bizarre approach to policy making to publish a report and then call afterwards for evidence to back it up? Does that not confirm the views of many of us, here and outside, that the Government have made up their minds on this issue? The fact is that the Government have not been able to provide a single piece of real evidence to show how this will support economic growth. The questions put on both sides of the Chamber illustrate that this approach is motivated not by policy, but by ideology?</p>

	<p pid="b.862.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. May I thank you personally, and also thank the whole House&#8212;whose opinion was expressed in an early-day motion sponsored by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> in the last Session&#8212;for supporting me in connection with the prosecution brought by the Northern Ireland Attorney-General? It is perhaps no coincidence that common sense finally prevailed last week and the Attorney-General dropped the prosecution, but issues of free speech for Members and the ancient offence of scandalising a judge are still unresolved. Will you consider, Mr Speaker, how the House could present proposals to give greater protection to freedom of speech for Members over contempt actions&#8212;whether or not statements are made in the House or outside&#8212;and make recommendations to the House?</p>

	<p pid="b.862.2/1">Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker. As you might imagine, since <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40414" name="Peter Hain">the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr Hain)</phrase> has been suffering this burden, a number of us have been looking into the possibilities. If you are able to answer the right hon.

	<p pid="b.862.3/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40414" name="Peter Hain">the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr Hain)</phrase> for his point of order, and for notice of it. I am also grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> for his follow-up. Let me first say, for the benefit of both the right hon. Member for Neath and the House, that, as he will recall, my concern was that Members who wish to table an early-day motion upon this matter should be free to do so in terms that reflect their beliefs&#8212;and it was then up to them to seek support from other Members of the House, which, indeed, was forthcoming in very substantial number. I note the thanks the right hon. Gentleman has given, but I simply thought I was doing my democratic duty by the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.862.3/2">Secondly, I may disappoint the right hon. Gentleman by saying the following, but it remains a fact: it would not be for me to recommend any such course of action in relation to the ancient offence to which he referred. That is not a matter for the Speaker, but the right hon. Gentleman, or any other non-ministerial Member, is free to propose legislation by way of a private Member&#8217;s Bill. Moreover, the right hon. Members for Neath and for Haltemprice and Howden and other Members are very well versed in the use of the procedures of this House to highlight what they judge to be a continuing omission or an area of policy that requires, let us say, corrective action. Knowing the right hon. Member for Neath and his track record of public campaigning on matters big and small over four decades, I doubt that he will require any further encouragement from the Chair.</p>

	<p pid="b.862.4/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On <phrase class="date" code="1997-03-19">19 March 1997</phrase>, the House passed a resolution which said, among other things:</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/2">&#8220;Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/3">Recently, I tabled the following question to the Prime Minister:</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/4">&#8220;To ask the Prime Minister whether he was aware at the time that on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase> Rebekah Brooks had discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer News Corporation&#8217;s bid for BSkyB.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/5">If ever there was a question that required a yes or no answer, that was it. I accept entirely that, like your predecessors, you, Mr Speaker, have always said you have no responsibility for ministerial replies&#8212;and I am sure you are very pleased about that. However, the Prime Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/6">&#8220;I had no role in the BSkyB takeover nor did I seek to influence the decision.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2012-05-17.246"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 May 2012; Vol. 545, c. 246W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.862.4/7">I never asked him that; I asked him the question I have quoted. I therefore wonder whether the Prime Minister is in some way in conflict with the resolution passed by the House on <phrase class="date" code="1997-03-19">19 March 1997</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.863.0/1">The short answer to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point of order is that I am not aware that there is any conflict with the terms of the resolution. As the hon. Gentleman also noted in his point of order, the Chair is not responsible for the content of answers. The obligation upon a Minister is to provide an answer to the question posed. Whether it is an answer of sufficient quality to satisfy Members, and in this instance the hon. Gentleman, is, sadly, another matter. However, the hon. Gentleman may wish to return to this matter, and it is open to him to do so in a variety of ways&#8212;which, as he first entered the House 46 years ago last March, he will not require advice from me to identify.</p>

	<p pid="b.869.0/1">I am delighted to be taking part in the resumption of the debate from the previous Session, as it is good to be resuming our consideration of this important Bill and these important provisions. The Bill is a major step forward in localising fundraising and decision making to local councils and restoring to them local control. Discussing local government finance is very much an acquired taste, albeit one that I can see has not been acquired by too many hon. Members today.</p>
	<p pid="b.869.0/2">May I draw the House&#8217;s attention to the publication of the statements of intent, which the Department has tabled for the benefit of hon. Members over the past few days? The statements bring to the House&#8217;s attention a great deal of the technical work behind the Bill and of how the Government intend that the scheme should be implemented over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="b.869.1/1">The Minister mentions the seven technical notes. Dozens and dozens of pages about how the Government are going to approach this were released on the working day before Report and Third Reading in this House, and three and a half months after this House finished</p>
	<p pid="b.869.1/2">its Committee stage. Does the Minister accept that to anyone outside this House it looks as though, at every stage, this Government are going out of their way to avoid people being able to take a proper look at this and to avoid this House being able to do its job of scrutinising this Bill properly? We will be leaving too much to the other House to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.870.0/1">I am extremely disappointed by the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s intervention. May I just remind him that when I assured the House that these papers would be published, there was universal astonishment that we proposed to do that before the Bill left this House? There was a universal assumption that I had somehow misspoken and that we actually meant to do this at a later stage. It is very much for the convenience of this House today that it should have these very important documents available for consideration, but the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that Members of the other place will have every opportunity to give further consideration to the information. Of course, the reason for publishing these papers in advance of the Bill completing its passages through the two Houses is to give local authorities and those who have to work on these schemes the maximum length of time to implement the necessary provisions, so that an appropriate and speedy commencement can be made next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.870.2/1">When the hon. Lady has taken the opportunity to look at the statements of intent, she will see that they are in effect&#8212;indeed, my note refers to it&#8212;draft statutory instruments. I remind her that we cannot publish draft statutory instruments until we have a Bill to publish them against. We have brought the statements of intent before both Houses so that matters for consideration are fully in view.</p>
	<p pid="b.870.2/2">New clause 9 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to introduce the necessary powers for local authorities to tackle fraud in claims for a reduction in liability to pay council tax, which will be effective from next April. Powers to investigate potential fraudulent claims for reductions in liability to pay council tax and to issue the appropriate penalties are a vital weapon for local authorities if they are properly to administer schemes and protect the public purse. The change from the existing scheme to the new scheme means that the new clause is needed to provide the necessary safeguards. Rather than simply reintroducing all the powers that local authorities have to tackle council tax benefit fraud, the clause allows us to work with local authorities to identify those powers and offences that will be needed to make local schemes work. The overall aim is that the regulations will reinstate only the necessary powers, offences, penalties and safeguards that are appropriate for the new scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.871.0/1">The provision allows us to enter into discussions with local authorities about the point my right hon. Friend raises. It is our intention not to increase the powers of local authorities but simply to transpose them from the existing scheme to the new scheme while recognising that a range of provisions in the current scheme needs to be considered rather than simply transposed without any further thought. New section 14A, which the Bill inserts into the Local Government Finance Act 1992, will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations giving local authorities the power to authorise officers to carry out investigations. Regulations may provide that officers so authorised may require relevant information from specified bodies to check whether a claim that they believe to be fraudulent is in fact so. The regulations may also provide authorities with powers to require that certain bodies must enter into arrangements allowing access to a person&#8217;s electronic records.</p>

	<p pid="b.871.1/1">That is the point I am trying to get at. It is already an offence to make a fraudulent declaration and to try to get out of paying this tax, and we all want to stop the fraud, but we also want to keep some civil liberties in this country. I must press the Minister again. What extra powers to investigate people and get access to their data are being taken?</p>

	<p pid="b.871.2/1">I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. The powers that local authorities rely on to guard against fraud in the current council tax benefit scheme will, in effect, lapse with the introduction of the new scheme. They are not competent to be used under the new scheme, so we need a new scheme. The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that the scheme takes account not just of concerns such as those held by my right hon. Friend but of the need to protect the public purse and that they are kept in proper and proportionate balance. We will not be giving local authorities powers to enter premises or to conduct inquiries and remove and copy documents from such premises. I hope my right hon. Friend finds that assurance helpful. The powers we are giving will require people to enter into arrangements under which access is permitted to relevant records and will, in our view, be sufficient for council tax purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.871.2/2">New section 14C will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations providing that authorities may issue penalties as an alternative to prosecution or where a person has not been charged with an offence. That will ensure that local authorities are able to take proportionate action, rather than being faced with the choice of pursuing prosecution or doing nothing. Before the debate on the amendments in the other place, we intend to publish a detailed statement of intent that will spell out clearly our proposals for regulations in accordance with the new clause. We have also made it clear in the new clause that any regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure and will therefore be debated by both Houses. I hope my right hon. Friend will be somewhat reassured by what I have said.</p>

	<p pid="b.872.0/1">The hon. Lady is well aware that there are such things as negligence and avoidance of reality. We are all aware of such cases. I see quite a few examples in the House from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="b.872.0/2">New clause 10 inserts into the Bill powers allowing Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs to supply information for prescribed purposes relating to council tax to billing authorities in England and Wales and to local authorities in Scotland, and provides for offences relating to the misuse of that information. It is the matching part of the preceding clause, the one that gives local authorities the power to ask bodies for information. This clause allows HMRC to supply that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.872.0/3">Data sharing will be an important way of maximising convenience and reducing complexity for claimants, while also helping to reduce administrative costs. It will reduce the need for individuals to have to provide the same information repeatedly to different public bodies and produce evidence about their situation to those bodies. Section 131 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 provides for the sharing of information relating to social security benefits and welfare services with a qualifying person for prescribed purposes relating to welfare services or council tax. The two new clauses, together with that provision, will enable data held by the Department for Work and Pensions in relation to current benefits and, in future, to universal credit, to be provided to English and Welsh billing authorities and Scottish local authorities for the administration of local council tax reduction schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.872.2/1">I may wish to return to the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point later in the debate, if the opportunity arises.

HMRC takes data protection extremely seriously, and the provisions in the Bill, which lie on top of the provisions in the Welfare Reform Act, are needed precisely because it is necessary to ensure that we have safeguarded HMRC and given it specific, explicit and closely confined powers on the transfer of data.</p>

	<p pid="b.873.4/1">I am certainly keen to offer, on behalf of the Department and the Government, a clear undertaking that it is not the intention that that should happen, and that the provisions before the House do not create the opportunity for that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/2">To return to the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40353" name="Hilary Benn">the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)</phrase>, proposed new section 14A, which relates to the investigation of fraud, will enable local authorities to investigate the eligibility of a person for a council tax reduction, which might require access to the individual&#8217;s records, in the same way as can currently be done for council tax benefit. That is separate from the provisions elsewhere relating to HMRC&#8217;s sharing of data with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/3">Proposed newparagraph 15B(7), of schedule 2 to the 1992 Act, sets out the procedure that Welsh Ministers must follow when making these regulations, which will be through a statutory instrument, subject to annulment procedures. Proposed new paragraph 15C(7) sets out the procedure that Scottish Ministers must follow when making regulations in respect of the data-sharing provisions, which will be through a Scottish statutory instrument, subject to the negative procedure. Without that legal gateway, HMRC would not be able to provide the information that billing authorities need for council tax purposes, such as calculating an entitlement to a reduction under a council tax reduction scheme, and if that were the case it would clearly increase the complexity for claimants and the administrative costs for billing authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/4">Government amendments 42 to 50 and 56 to 60 would provide Welsh Ministers with the powers to place a duty on specified bodies in Wales to introduce council tax reduction schemes in Wales. Welsh Ministers have developed plans for locally delivered council tax reductions and asked for these amendments, which will enable them to prescribe, by regulations, for establishing in Wales council tax reduction schemes that are broadly similar to those that billing authorities in England will be required to introduce in accordance with the Bill. Those powers would provide Welsh Ministers with the scope to establish the remit for council tax reduction schemes in Wales that were appropriate for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/5">Welsh Ministers have said that they intend to use the powers to introduce a single national scheme set out in regulations and include the reforms necessary to meet the 10% reduction in funding. They intend local authorities to be given an amount of local flexibility in the new scheme&#8217;s delivery, and deviation from the national scheme will be funded locally. Welsh Ministers have recently consulted on the policy&#8217;s detail, and they intend to set out their proposals on vulnerable groups, including pensioners, in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/6">Amendment 44, to section 13A of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, would provide Welsh Ministers with the power to require specified bodies in Wales to introduce council tax reduction schemes, and the proposed change details the scope of the regulations that Welsh Ministers would be able to make. Amendment 45 sets out the procedure that Welsh Ministers would have to follow when making regulations on the introduction of council tax reduction schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/7">The amendments include a series of provisions that I am very happy to bring to the House&#8217;s attention if Members would like me to do so, but it might be sensible if I proceed by saying simply that the amendments set out a range of requirements and rules that are intended entirely to ensure that the scheme can be applied as Welsh Ministers determine in the Welsh environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/8">Amendments 51 and 54 are technical amendments to ensure that we can deliver our policy to protect pensioners, enabling regulations to provide for a default scheme that largely replicates current council tax benefit, and providing reassurance to local authorities that their schemes can incorporate certain features of current council tax benefit when they choose them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/9">Taken together the amendments to schedule 4 would achieve that aim by ensuring that regulations prescribing requirements for schemes and regulations prescribing</p>
	<p pid="b.873.4/10">the default scheme may incorporate provisions equivalent to those that are, or could be, provided for in the sections of existing legislation relating directly to council tax benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.875.0/1">Why does the default scheme replicate the existing scheme on a 10% cut? Is the intention to penalise financially those councils that do not come up with their own scheme in time?</p>

	<p pid="b.875.1/1">There is certainly an incentive for local authorities to introduce a scheme of their own choosing. The whole point of this is that local authorities should have the capacity to have their own scheme, designed as they see fit. If they have not formed such a scheme by the relevant date in January, the default scheme comes into play, and that scheme will, in essence, continue with the existing council tax benefit scheme in its entirety. Taken together, the amendments to schedule 4 ensure that regulations prescribing requirements for schemes and prescribing the default scheme allow local authorities to take this approach and, if they so wish, to adopt the existing scheme lock, stock and barrel.</p>
	<p pid="b.875.1/2">The Government have already confirmed their commitment to protecting pensioners on low incomes and have said that there should be no change in support to them as a result of the introduction of this reform. Support will continue to be rules-based, with provisions about the calculations to be made set out in regulations under paragraphs 2(8) and 2(9) of new schedule 1A to the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which is inserted by schedule 4 to the Bill. As the House is aware, it is intended that the support scheme for pensioners will be protected so that their support is as close as possible to what they receive at present. Paragraph 4 of new schedule 1A provides powers for the Secretary of State to prescribe a default scheme in regulations to take effect in any authority that has not made its own scheme by <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase>. The default scheme will cover those who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit and those who have not yet attained it. The Government have been clear that they intend the default scheme to be as similar as possible to the existing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.875.1/3">These technical amendments will enable regulations prescribing the requirements for pensioner protection and the default scheme to make use of the same powers, definitions and treatments as set out in the detail of the existing council tax benefit legislation. The Government believe that that will help to facilitate their provision of protection for those of pension credit age and provide the legal backstop of a default scheme that can take effect should a local authority not complete its own scheme. In particular, amendment 51, new schedule 1A, paragraph 2 and sub-paragraph (10) will allow the Government, when they set up the scheme, to make equivalent provision to that contained in the one of the enactments listed in sub-paragraph (12). New paragraph (3A) in amendment 54 allows the default scheme to make equivalent provision to that capable of being made under the same enactment.</p>
	<p pid="b.875.1/4">There is a great deal of detail that I am happy to bring to the House should Members wish to have it, and more in the statements of intent. If the House is content at this point, I will move on to Government amendment 52. As set out in the statements of intent that we have published on our plans for localising support, the Government do not propose to make regulations as to</p>
	<p pid="b.875.1/5">how a billing authority will prepare a scheme because that would not enhance the existing requirements and duties of authorities in consulting and involving local people. It therefore does not make sense to prevent billing authorities, after consulting their major precepting authorities, from proceeding to publish their scheme and to consult others if they are in a position to do so prior to the Bill&#8217;s receiving Royal Assent. Amendment 52 allows councils to proceed in that direction if they wish. In other words, if, after consulting its major precepting authorities, a billing authority wants to publish its local scheme and to consult any other person with an interest in the scheme, it can do so straight away without running any additional risks arising from carrying out those steps in advance of Royal Assent.</p>

	<p pid="b.876.0/1">Are not the Government too often taking steps to implement legislation before it has been passed? We saw that with the Health and Social Care Bill and we are seeing it again now.

	<p pid="b.876.1/1">In the last Session, the hon. Lady spent a lot of time telling us that we had not produced enough detail, nor given local authorities enough warning or flexibility. It seems a little perverse for her to say now that she does not want local authorities to have the flexibility to get a scheme under way pronto, if they are in a position to do so. I do not understand her confused logic.</p>
	<p pid="b.876.1/2">Government amendment 53 is a minor technical amendment, which will ensure that the first financial year to which the default scheme relates is the same as that specified for the implementation of council tax reduction schemes in clause 8(4). Amendment 55 relates to claims that are in progress when the schemes come into force: in essence, any claims in the pipeline will be rolled over, rather than applicants being required to start again with a new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.876.1/3">That completes my remarks about the Government proposals, but it is right and proper that I comment on the proposals from other parts of the House. New clause 2, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>, would do away with the automatic entitlement to the single person discount, which has been a feature of council tax since its introduction. I remind the House that households with just one adult are eligible to claim the single person discount on their council tax bill, and that is not a benefit but a tax discount that has been a fundamental feature of council tax since its creation in 1993. Eight million households in England receive the single person discount, of which 90% are in bands A to D; it is therefore not a subsidy for the wealthy. Indeed, 29% of households in Great Britain are single-person households and another 7% are single-parent households, which are also eligible for the tax discount.</p>
	<p pid="b.876.1/4">New clause 2 would pass to local authorities discretion on whether to grant a discount to such people and the size of the discount as part of setting their council tax reduction scheme. Clause 8(2) provides that</p>
	<p pid="b.876.1/5">&#8220;Each billing authority in England must make a scheme specifying the reductions which are to apply to amounts of council tax&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.877.1/1">That is a severe criticism of new clause 2, which would pass down to councils the capacity to change single person discounts. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, that would create difficulties in implementation. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne, when he speaks in favour of the new clause, will explain to the hon. Gentleman exactly how it would work.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.1/2">New clause 2 would not only interfere with the single person discount, but give billing authorities discretion on whether a 50% discount should be granted in other circumstances. Currently, that applies when a dwelling is not unoccupied but is no one&#8217;s sole or main residence. At one time, that would have meant second homes, but the provision on those was amended in the Local Government Act 2003. The 50% discount still applies in some cases, when the second home is job-related. That is a matter of particular importance to the clergy and to service personnel. I suspect that the new clause would have an effect that the right hon. Gentleman does not intend.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.1/3">Whatever the superficial attractions of the new clause&#8212;particularly to billing authorities, whose revenue-raising powers would be increased&#8212;it would certainly not be attractive to the 29% of households in which people live alone or the 7% of households that are single-parent families. Those categories include many older people, including widows and widowers, and the Government have made it clear that we intend that they retain their protection. We have prefigured that with our two-year council tax freeze, and our clear intention is to ensure that there is no loss of single person discount.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.1/4">New clause 5 is interesting. The Government will monitor and review changes as part of the equality impact assessment process, as they do after every Act is implemented to check that it works as planned and to screen for unexpected equality impacts. There are already powers in the Bill to allow for that. Schedule 4 will insert into the Local Government Finance Act 1992 a new schedule 1A, which will enable the Secretary of State to require authorities to supply specified information to him. In the Government&#8217;s equality impact assessment of that reform, we made it clear that those powers could be used to collect information to support future evaluation of the policy. In other words, new clause 5 is not necessary, as what it suggests is already covered entirely in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.877.3/1">If the hon. Lady looks at the impact assessment submitted alongside the Bill, she will see that the specific question of whether the policy will be reviewed is addressed. The answer to her question is yes, and, if I remember correctly, the time interval before the publication will be three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.3/2">Taken together, amendments 10, 13, 6 and 7 would delay by a year the localisation of the council tax reduction scheme, pushing it back from 2013 to 2014. The Government are very clear that the reform needs to be implemented in 2013 to secure the agreed savings set out in the 2010 comprehensive spending review. I think the Labour party is still struggling to come to terms with the fact that in 2010, &#163;1 was being borrowed for every &#163;4 spent and we were adding &#163;400 million to the national debt every day. Tackling the deficit and establishing fiscal responsibility is a central part of the coalition Government&#8217;s strategy, and the changes to the scheme are fundamental to achieving the savings set out in the CSR.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.3/3">There are things that councils should already be doing to prepare for the change, and we are supporting them in doing so, not least through the provision that the hon. Lady queried a few minutes ago. They should understand the circumstances of those in their area who currently claim support, ensure that elected members are aware of the decisions that they will need to take and engage with precepting authorities, such as police and fire authorities. They have the opportunity to prepare for and carry out consultation as soon as they are ready to do so&#8212;Government amendment 52 supports local authorities in their preparations by making that clear. The Government therefore believe that the amendments to delay the scheme are inappropriate and would create an unnecessary burden for local authorities, which will continue to be subject to their existing equalities duty and so will have to take that fully into account in their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.877.3/4">The public sector equality duty includes a requirement for local authorities to have regard to advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not, and to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination. That continuous process requires relevant decision makers in local authorities to consider equality issues. That has a bearing not only on the question of delaying the scheme, which would incur costs and difficulties, but on amendment 9, which would require local authorities to notify current claimants of the potential impact of the draft scheme. Local authorities are already required, by paragraph 3(1) or proposed new schedule 1A to the 1992 Act, to consult on the draft scheme with such persons as they consider</p>

I again make the point that other measures in the Bill give greater discretion to local authorities on raising council tax on second and empty homes. The vast majority of local authorities potentially have a substantial stream of additional income, if they believe they will face difficulties because of the reductions in income resulting from this part of the Bill. The Bill has to be taken as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.880.5/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to take stock of just how much council tax benefit someone in band A in his local authority might be getting and compare it with the discount that they might receive through the raising of tax thresholds. He might then grudgingly have to agree that the situation is not as bad as he maintains.</p>
	<p pid="b.880.5/2">Amendment 1 would require the Government to consult on regulations prescribing requirements for schemes. Of course external scrutiny of plans for the framework is important, which is why the Government have published the detailed statements of intent for the key regulations that will deliver the policy. We will publish further statements of intent at each stage, as necessary. That will provide an opportunity for us to engage with local government on the detail of our plans before draft regulations are produced, and give local authorities the key information they need to develop their schemes. There is no need for additional requirements to consult with local authorities, such as amendment 1 would impose. In addition, we are working closely with local government representatives to design the framework within which local authorities will be required to operate, including considering what&#8212;if any&#8212;provision needs to be made for how local authorities should prepare schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.880.5/3">Amendment 3 is a bit of a stray. It would remove the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase> for making revisions to or wholly revising schemes. The Government are clear that</p>
	<p pid="b.880.5/4">schemes cannot be amended in-year, but changes can be made between years. It is necessary to set a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase> for revisions to schemes to provide certainty for council tax payers about when a final scheme will be issued. To remove the deadline could create significant uncertainty for low-income groups concerned about what support they will be able to claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.880.5/5">Amendments 11 and 12 relate to the default scheme. I hope that I have already said enough to make it clear that the Government propose that the default scheme should retain the criteria and allowances currently in place for council tax benefit. We published a detailed statement of intent setting out how we expect to provide for the default scheme of regulations. As it is not intended that the default scheme will provide for any reductions in support, there will&#8212;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the hon. Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> said&#8212;be a strong financial incentive for local authorities to avoid that, but the amendments are designed to guarantee that under the default scheme there will be no reduction in the level of support. Well, the scheme itself will have no reduction in the level of support.</p>

The empty homes premium came from the Liberal Democrat stable and I am pleased that it is in the Bill. I am sure that my hon. Friends will be eloquent in supporting their proposition, but I have to tell them that the Government believe that it is right to invest heavily in bringing empty homes back into use, and that is why we are using the policy levers available to us.

For some rural areas, especially tourist-focused ones, a significant fraction of the housing stock may be occupied&#8212;or perhaps unoccupied&#8212;as second homes, which makes it very difficult for those who live and work there to secure accommodation. I am sure he has taken note of our changes to the second home discount</p>
	<p pid="b.881.3/2">provisions, which give local authorities in those areas the opportunity to bring their council tax bills up to 100%. His new clause proposes a premium on top of that.

	<p pid="b.882.1/1">I understand the hon. Lady&#8217;s point, but in Rotherham the funding gap is &#163;1.8 million and the total value of discounts and exemptions granted by the Bill &#163;1.9 million. To be clear, a 10% reduction for Rotherham is easily covered by the discounts and exemptions in the Bill. That is not true of every local authority, but it perhaps illustrates that there is a good deal of unnecessary trouble stirring by the Opposition. They are paid to do it, I understand that; but sometimes it is important to refer to the facts. In particular, I noticed that one of the leading financial officials on whom the Local Government Association draws for advice is the chief finance officer of Rotherham, so I am sure that those figures, which he submitted to the Department, are correct.</p>

Why, during that period, did we not have proper time to discuss the Bill&#8217;s very serious implications? Why did the Government not use it to publish the draft regulations that the Minister promised in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase>?

I remember well the lack of detailed scrutiny, with a number of amendments simply not being called because of the lack of time.

That was just one further way in which the Government could have ensured proper scrutiny, giving a proper opportunity to those most profoundly affected by the changes to give evidence to us and to help shape a better Bill than the one we face today. But no, the Government simply did not want scrutiny because, as we shall see, they are pushing through a crude measure that will have a profound impact&#8212;of some &#163;500 million&#8212;either on individuals or on local authority budgets, and they are doing so without proper care or consideration of those consequences.

There were horror stories from all over the country of people not receiving the benefits to which they were entitled, and huge backlogs of cases building up in local authorities. One would think that a Government who had experienced that in their history&#8212;or at least the Conservative part, which went through that experience in government&#8212;would want to avoid doing the same thing again. But here we are, with a Government once again rushing to introduce complex changes in benefits that will have profound impacts on many individuals&#8217; potential entitlement, and doing so to a ridiculously tight timetable.</p>

	<p pid="b.883.2/1">I think the Minister answered the question earlier: this measure is not about reform of local government finance, but about deficit reduction. However, is it not also about devolving the responsibility&#8212;and the blame&#8212;for implementing these proposals to local authorities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.884.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="884"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0002.htm#12052127000200">
	<p pid="b.884.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right: this measure is not about reforming the benefits system or creating a benefit; it is about imposing crude cuts in expenditure either on individual recipients or on local authorities. It is about the Government passing the buck, putting the responsibility and blame elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/2">Let us look at the timetable. We know how many tasks are involved if a local authority is properly to introduce its own local scheme of council tax benefit next April. What will a local authority have to do? It will first have to consider in detail the implications of the regulations&#8212;it has to know what law it has to comply with. Over the last year or so we have heard about various aspirations from the Government. We heard the Minister say that no pensioner should lose; we have also heard the aspiration that there should not be any work disincentives. How those two are compatible we have never had explained to us. If we have a benefit that goes to a substantial number of pensioners and a substantial number of people in low-paid work, and if we exempt one of those groups from any losses and then announce a 10% cut overall, the other group has to face that loss by definition. It is, I am afraid, a simple piece of logic. The Government have not come forward with any explanation of how the aspiration that there should be no work disincentives can possibly be achieved. It is the most flabbergasting case of what George Orwell would have described as &#8220;doublethink&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/3">The first task of local authorities, when they have seen the regulations, will therefore be to consider the implications. Then they will have to devise a draft scheme, taking account of the needs of the area and local aspirations. Many people in this House support the concept of localisation, but want it done properly. That would require local authorities to have the opportunity to consider what the best shape of a local council tax benefit scheme would be for it to respond to the needs of the area. Having done that, they should consult, which we all know is part of good administration. Consulting the considerable numbers of people affected is not trivial&#8212;we are talking about 6 million households nationally, which means tens of thousands in every local authority area. After a proper consultation, so that individuals will know the likely implications, local authorities should finalise their schemes and then brief their IT suppliers to produce the software necessary to administer them.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/4">Ministers are seriously suggesting that local authorities should conduct that particular process in a matter of little more than eight months, because January next year is the cut-off date by which the benefits scheme has to be finalised. What world are they living in? What experience do they have of implementing complex changes in benefits? If they had any real-world experience, they would immediately realise that they have set local authorities an impossible task.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/5">What makes this sinister is the fact that we know what the Government expect to happen. They know that local authorities will probably respond by saying, &#8220;This is too difficult, so we had better take the hit ourselves. We will take the cost of the reduction in subsidy and absorb it into our own budget to avoid upsetting too many of our local residents by imposing harsh cuts on them.&#8221; That, we know, is the reality. As I said earlier, that is why the Government are guilty of</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/6">trying to offload this &#163;500 million package of cuts either on recipients or on local authorities. That is why amendments 6, 7, 10 and 13 seek to get the Government off the hook by delaying implementation for 12 months to allow proper consideration and a proper orderly transition so that implementation will not lead to the problems I have described.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/7">There is no logical case against that course. The Select Committee was adamant when it looked at the problem, and it recommended that the Government should delay. Local authorities are all backing these amendments, so why will the Government not accept them? We have heard the feeble excuse offered once again by the Minister, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s due to cuts. We can&#8217;t do anything else because of cuts.&#8221; I am sorry to say that this is not a Government looking intelligently or carefully at how to make savings without causing difficulties and hardship; rather, they are simply trying to offload these problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/8">There is one other consideration to which the Government should give some thought, and I suspect some local authority lawyers are already giving thought to it. If it is impossible for local authorities to administer the scheme in a way that makes the savings by reducing benefits, and they conclude that they have to absorb the costs themselves, this amounts to a new burden imposed by the Government. Under the new burdens doctrine, Governments have said repeatedly&#8212;and this Government have repeated it&#8212;that they should cover any additional costs imposed on local government that result from Government decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/9">I therefore advise Ministers to think a bit more about the implications of their new burdens doctrine. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, who, when in opposition, was only too keen to talk about new burdens and to attack the Labour Government of the time for not honouring the new burdens doctrine, would do better if he now ensured that his own Government followed the words he used then. It is an interesting case of someone changing their tack once they find themselves on the Treasury Benches&#8212;briefly, I suspect, in his case. <i>[Interruption.] </i>This is not a unique or personal slight aimed at the Under-Secretary, as I would apply it to the entire Government Bench.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/10">Amendment 9 seeks to impose an obligation whereby councils, in devising their local scheme, should inform recipients in advance of what the impact will be &#8220;on their living standards&#8221;. This is a fairly straightforward and sensible proposal to make people aware of what the local authority is proposing. It was suggested for that reason, and I would have thought that any reasonable Government would support it.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/11">Amendments 11 and 12 deal with the default scheme that the Government are going to produce. Amendment 11 simply confirms what the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> has said he intends&#8212;that there should be no pensioner losers. It is extraordinary, therefore, that he is so reluctant to accept it. He says that it is not necessary. However, because we know that so many Government pledges unfortunately prove worthless, we would rather have this on the statute book than in the form of a ministerial assurance, and we will draw our own conclusions from his refusal to accept the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/12">Amendment 12 concerns transitional protection. If the Minister argues that there will be no losses under the Government&#8217;s default scheme, his argument will suggest that there is no need for such protection. The amendment would ensure that if losses are implicit in the default scheme, the scheme must include the transitional protection that is proposed. That is an entirely reasonable and logical formulation, and I am surprised that the Government are reluctant to accept it.</p>
	<p pid="b.884.0/13">This series of badly thought out proposals will cause widespread hardship and serious financial difficulty to local authorities, and it is being rushed through in a way that will make it difficult to implement properly. It is a sad and sorry saga, and I find it regrettable that the Government have not the realism and the sense of respectability to admit that they have made a serious mistake. They have got themselves into a difficult mess, and the only honest thing that they can, and should, do now is agree to the amendments that would defer implementation until 2014. That would provide time for the issues to be considered seriously and properly by all involved, and would enable the Government to escape from this mess.</p>

	<p pid="b.886.0/1">As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> pointed out, the Bill has not changed greatly since we last debated it. The underlying theme remains. As the Minister made clear, it has nothing to do with reform or enabling councils to implement a local scheme; it is actually about the Government&#8217;s deficit reduction targets. That is why they are so keen to aim for implementation in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.886.0/2">The Minister seems to think&#8212;and I recall that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> said this during our last debate&#8212;that all local authorities are on a level playing field, but they are clearly not. The Minister suggested that, following the 10% cut in council tax benefit, councils could make up the difference if they wished to, which may be all well and good for councils in areas where the benefit is being increased. I hate to return to my favourite example of Wokingham, but a few weeks ago a very good article in the <i>Financial Times </i>stated that its budget was rising by 3%&#8212;unlike the budgets of authorities such as Durham, which are declining by as much as 15%.</p>
	<p pid="b.886.0/3">We are not dealing with level playing fields; we are dealing with a strategy that the Government have worked out quite well. As we can see from the playbook according to which the Conservative part of the coalition is working, it is nothing new. The same strategy was adopted by the Conservatives in Canada in the 1990s. They made savage cuts in public services and devolved decision making to local level: in their case, federal level. What they were saying was &#8220;We are giving you freedoms, but we are ensuring that you take all the blame for the cuts.&#8221; The flexibility that councils will be given will, in fact, cause them great difficulty, unless they are in Wokingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.886.0/4">That very good article in the <i>Financial Times</i>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-07">7 May</phrase>, was headed &#8220;The well-to-do towns that austerity forgot&#8221;. I think that it is worth looking at, and not just because it makes it plain that the Government are rewarding their own councils while penalising poor areas. Let us look at the calculations for Wokingham. It is among the 8% of local authority areas&#8212;out of a</p>
	<p pid="b.886.0/5">total of 152&#8212;that are expecting a real increase in local government spending over the period set out by the Government. Meanwhile, 20% of councils, including Durham, are taking cuts in excess of 15%.</p>
	<p pid="b.886.0/6">We are being told that we are all in this together and that what is being done is fair, but let us look at the difference between Wokingham and Wigan. In the index of multiple-deprivation, Wokingham scores 5.5 whereas Wigan scores 26. On average, there is an additional 1% increase in local government spending cuts between 2009-10 and 2011-12. Not only are local authorities in the north-east and other deprived areas suffering because their grants are being cut, but they are now going to be hit again by the council tax benefit cut. Local authorities will be told they are being given the flexibility to administer the scheme, but the result will be a 10% cut.</p>

	<p pid="b.887.0/1">My hon. Friend mentions Wigan in the north-west and authorities in the north-east, but the case he makes is equally true for many authorities in Yorkshire and the Humber, such as Barnsley and Rotherham. As he has access to the figures, he might care to look at them in this regard. Wokingham may be facing an increase in its grant, which is astonishing given that local government is taking such a hit across the board, but Barnsley and Rotherham are facing double-digit reductions in their grant, despite increasing need and increasing pressure on services in their communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.887.1/1">I agree. My right hon. Friend&#8217;s authority and mine are among those that are having to take &#163;152 million out of the budget over the next four years. In Wokingham, however, the council is planning to overhaul its town centre at a cost of &#163;30 million, and it is not closing its libraries and its voluntary sector groups have not lost their funding. In communities such as mine and that of my right hon. Friend, councils are having to find savings&#8212;and they are having to find them in areas such as libraries and non-statutory services.</p>
	<p pid="b.887.1/2">In Durham, the bulk of expenditure goes on adult social care. The Labour-run local authority is rightly making sure the most vulnerable are protected, but that restricts where savings in the budget can be made. I send a clear message to the Liberal Democrats sitting on Durham county council that, as a result of their Ministers&#8217; actions and their Members&#8217; votes on this Bill, Durham and other local authorities are having to make savage cuts. The idea that they can be found simply through efficiencies is complete nonsense. No organisation could reduce expenditure so much without affecting front-line services.</p>

	<p pid="b.887.3/1">That is a very important point. That will limit the ability of my council in County Durham and my right hon. Friend&#8217;s authority to effect any change. That will lock in the unfair and disproportionate effects, which have been caused by no account having been taken of deprivation. We have just heard a Minister saying this Bill takes account of equality, but it must be the first Bill in history that supports a system by which</p>
	<p pid="b.887.3/2">the poorest in our society and those councils with the largest need&#8212;growing aged populations and increasing numbers of looked-after children, for example&#8212;will suffer the most.</p>

	<p pid="b.888.1/1">Huge regional inequalities are involved. In addition, the pressures on councils in South Yorkshire, and in Middlesbrough and South Tyneside, which I cited in a previous debate, compared with leafy Wokingham, mean that if services such as providing for looked-after children and a growing elderly population are to be protected, the scope for cuts is very limited. The Minister laid it bare in his response: this is not about reforming or giving local councils the ability to be flexible; it is about implementing the deficit reduction strategy of this coalition Government. As my hon. Friend said, that will take demand out of areas such as mine. It is impossible to implement this system without further cutting the support for some of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

	<p pid="b.888.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, and I wholly agree with him about the adverse impact on some of the most deprived areas. Does he also recognise that one of the bizarre features of the Government&#8217;s proposals is that they will inflict losses on people throughout the country? There are 6 million recipients of council tax benefit, many of whom are in low-paid work in parts of the country that are relatively more affluent than the area he represents, and those people will suffer, too. Although he is absolutely right in what he is saying, the impact of the Government&#8217;s proposal will be even more savage and unfair.</p>

	<p pid="b.888.3/1">Well it will be. The mistake that the Government are making in the spin they are clearly putting out is in saying that this will affect only the &#8220;undeserving poor&#8221;&#8212;the workshy and feckless. As my right hon. Friend rightly points out, many people in receipt of council tax benefit are in low-paid work. In sectors where jobs are growing, the increases are mainly in part-time, low-paid and low-skilled jobs, so more people might come into this bracket.</p>
	<p pid="b.888.3/2">This measure will affect people, and not only in terms of their council tax benefit; we need to add on the ludicrous nonsense in the housing benefit changes, which will result in individuals in my constituency who have an extra bedroom suddenly finding themselves up to &#163;10 to &#163;15 a week worse off. The Government&#8217;s measures will have a cumulative effect on the poorest communities and, I have to say, some of the hardest-working individuals in this country. We might add to that this Government&#8217;s VAT increases, which the Liberal Democrats and the Deputy Prime Minister were clear in opposing before the election only then to implement and turn a blind eye to, saying, &#8220;It does not really matter because we have a commitment to reducing income tax.&#8221; The cumulative effect of these measures will be to take a vast amount of money out of the poorest communities in the country. The opportunity to gain full-time employment is very</p>
	<p pid="b.888.3/3">limited in some areas, because of short-time working, which means lower wages, and the growth in the number of part-time workers.</p>

I have a cutting here from the <i>Daily Mail</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-11">11 June 2010</phrase> headlined, &#8220;Tory minister under fire for gaffe as he tells MPs: &#8216;Those in most need will bear the burden of cuts&#8217;&#8221;. The article states:</p>
	<p pid="b.888.3/5">&#8220;Unveiling a 1.2 billion package of cuts to councils, Local Government minister Bob Neill suggested the poorest areas would suffer the most.</p>
	<p pid="b.888.3/6">Asked why northern cities were losing&#8230;more than southern areas, Mr Neill said: &#8216;Those in greatest need ultimately bear the burden of paying off the debt.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.888.3/7">That comes from exactly the same Government who were happy to slash the income tax rate from 50p to 45p, giving huge tax breaks to some of the wealthiest in the country. The Minister should come to North Durham to speak to some of my constituents in low-paid work who are earning less than what some of these individuals are going to get in tax breaks in a year. That clearly shows that the Government do not have a clue about the effect on the poorest in our society. The idea that we are all in this together is complete nonsense.</p>

Gentleman is old enough to remember records&#8212;I think he is&#8212;but if he does he will remember that trying to play a broken record is very difficult. The rhetoric from the election, when the Government blamed everything, including the world recession, on the Labour party, has now become a broken record. We are now into another recession in this country that was of this Government&#8217;s making. It is interesting that the Chancellor of the Exchequer now argues that the British economy is not doing well because of the eurozone. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, when the banking crisis hit, it was all Labour&#8217;s fault; now it is all Europe&#8217;s fault. The only people who are not accepting any responsibility are this coalition Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.889.1/2">Was our borrowing in 2008 and 2009 the right thing to do? Yes, it was. It was the right thing to do to ensure a growing and stable economy. We do not have that now; we have a recession that has been made in Downing street by this coalition Government. The idea that the fair way of dealing with that is to reduce the top rate of income tax so that it will, through Reaganomics, trickle down to boost the economy is complete nonsense. We have also heard complete nonsense this afternoon that</p>
	<p pid="b.889.1/3">the way to get growth is to slash employment rights. The Government are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think that that will not have an effect on local people.</p>

I remember the Conservative Government getting the poll tax wrong. Even when it was quite evident that it was going to be complete chaos, they would not change their mind. We are trying to rush through a system that will affect some of the poorest people and the poorest councils, adding to the injustice of the skewed way in which the Government have rewarded their friends on councils in the south. We are setting local government an absolutely horrendous task. The idea that the system can somehow be changed tomorrow at the flick of a switch is complete nonsense and I hate to think of the sleepless nights these provisions will give local treasurers.

Up to now, we have been talking only about the 10% cut, which totals &#163;500 million, but under the scheme local authorities will be liable if there is an increase in demand for council tax benefit, possibly because of the closure of a local business or because the double-dip recession, which the Government have created, has caused further hardship and unemployment, meaning that more people are claiming council tax benefit. That risk is clearly now with the local authority and many treasurers will be nervous about the implications for them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.890.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="890"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0002.htm#12052127000213">
	<p pid="b.890.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes a good point. Let me take my constituency as an example. Compared with April last year, 384 more people are unemployed. The figure represents nearly 7.2% of the population and shows no sign of decreasing. The demand will not be on the central pot but on the councils. If councils have the large pressures that we see in Durham and elsewhere, because of the number of children in care and adults with social needs, where will that money come from? We can add the 10% cut to those pressures, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/2">As for the chaos that the process will lead to, although some councils&#8212;certainly Wokingham&#8212;will be able to afford to absorb such a reduction to their budget, not many will be. The mechanics of putting the system in place will be very difficult. What will happen if, with the best of intentions and advice, the computer systems cannot be put in place? Where will a local council find its money? What will happen if a scheme is put in place that has teething problems that lead to mistakes? What will happen with appeals and with the process of dealing with the situation? There is no remedy at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/3">Chaos and uncertainty will be faced by many low-paid families in this country and they will not know how the change will affect them. That is why amendment 9, tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, is right. It must be made crystal clear what the effect will be on individuals. I support my right hon. Friend&#8217;s amendment, but I think that it might be playing into the Government&#8217;s hands, as they will want to blame the local council&#8212;in my case, Durham&#8212;for what is happening. Councils need to make it very clear</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/4">that responsibility for the cuts lies with this Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition Government. If they do not do that, the tactics that the Conservatives are using and that the Liberal Democrats have sleepwalked into mean that local people will blame local councils.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/5">Local Liberal Democrat councillors in Durham, for example, are arguing against changes to library hours and to local leisure centres. They will sign petitions to their hearts&#8217; content. Small equatorial rainforests are decimated for local Liberal Democrat copies of &#8220;Focus&#8221; that state that they are supporting decisions against such moves by Labour Durham county council. They are not explaining to the people, however, that their coalition with the Conservatives in government nationally is cutting the county council&#8217;s budget savagely while helping the leafy Wokinghams of this world. That is the message we must get across to people: these cuts and their effect on local services and on people&#8217;s income are down to the coalition Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/6">I reiterate what I have said before: not one single piece of the legislation that has such an effect could go through without the complicity and support of the Liberal Democrats. They must take as much of the blame for the pain and heartache coming the way of many people in County Durham over the next 12 months as the Conservatives and it is no good hiding behind the idea that County Durham has somehow been given the freedom to come up with this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/7">My other concern is the differentials between schemes. That will create particular problems in parts of London, where there is a transient population and people frequently move around. They understand the present scheme and know what is expected of them. Different schemes in operation in different boroughs will lead to chaos and confusion not only for individuals but for borough treasurers trying to keep track of what people earn.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/8">The Minister made it clear today that the measure is about deficit reduction. It is no great radical idea about devolving responsibility to local authorities, and no great victory for the Liberal Democrats who believe in the devolution of local decision making. If the scheme has been properly worked out, why can we not have a transitional scheme, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich suggested, so that the people and the councils affected have time to adjust? That would give some local authorities the stability that they will not get from the proposed scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/9">I hate to say it, but, as my right hon. Friend said, in 12 months or less, we will say we told you so. The misery and heartache that will be created for some of the most vulnerable people in our society is shameful. That is to be expected of Conservatives, but not of Liberal Democrats. The Minister may say that according to his impact study, equality is taken into account, but it is not. The measure will affect some of the poorest in society, including many women, who will not be protected in any way. The only group to have been taken out of the system for electoral reasons is the elderly. Having borne the wrath resulting from the granny tax, the Government clearly did not want to upset the elderly by allowing the council tax benefit reduction to affect them.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/10">But the Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that they are devolving responsibility to local councils, and then tell local councils that they</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/11">must take one section of society out of that scheme from day 1, along with a 10% cut. If it were genuine devolution, it would not have been so rushed, and if the Minister genuinely believed in devolving power, although I have never believed that Whitehall would want to give truly devolved powers to local authorities, there would be no ring-fencing. The Government are doing that because they know that the measure will be unpopular with a large section of the population who actually vote. That is the only reason why older people are excluded from the provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/12">A delay is needed, but the Minister let the cat out of the bag and said that the measure is nothing to do with local government finance, but is aimed at deficit reduction. The Opposition would enter into dialogue with the Government about genuine devolution and proper reform of local government finance, but they have shied away from the elephant in the room&#8212;the re-banding of council tax. Ministers will not go near that for fear of upsetting a lot of people. If there is going to be radical change in local government finance, it must include a review of council tax bandings. I am sorry if that scares members of my own Front-Bench team. Without that, the Bill is no more than a short-term measure to achieve savings, as the Minister admitted, as a means of deficit reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.890.1/13">The strategy has clearly failed. We are now in a continuing double-dip recession, which this time will be blamed on the euro crisis. Why pay for that on the back of some of the poorest parts of the country? That is inexcusable in the Government&#8217;s approach to the Bill. Let us do away with the pretence that it is about reform. It is about deficit reduction and about hitting the poorest hardest. We need to remind people at local level that the decisions taken in this place by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will take financial support from the poorest in our communities and some of the most hard-working families in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.892.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, who has more than a decade&#8217;s experience in local government and knows what it is like for local authorities trying to deal with central Government cuts and central Government diktats. He knows that local government across the board, irrespective of party, is willing to change but wants that change to be implemented properly and fairly. Much in the Bill will make that more difficult for local government in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.892.0/2">The Bill signals that council tax benefit is no longer a benefit or an entitlement for those whose incomes are such that they need help with council tax costs. In future, there will be a means-tested, cash-limited discount on council tax bills. That limit next year will be 10% less than the spend on and cost of council tax benefit this year. I have the figures released recently by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, showing the total subsidy properly paid by councils to those entitled and then properly reclaimed from Government in 2010-11. In Rotherham, the figure was &#163;22.5 million; in the other local authority that my constituency partly covers, Barnsley, it was nearly &#163;20 million; and the total for South Yorkshire was &#163;112 million. That money went to many of the poorest, who need help with their council tax costs and who currently have an entitlement to that help. In future</p>
	<p pid="b.892.0/3">there will be a smaller cash-limited pot and a severe means test, with that &#163;112 million cut from the outset by 10%.</p>
	<p pid="b.892.0/4">Earlier, from the Dispatch Box, the Minister gave some figures&#8212;&#163;1.8 million and &#163;1.9 million&#8212;which he said were the figures for the value of the reliefs and discounts compared with what he argues is the shortfall in Rotherham. Of course, reliefs and discounts are part of the council tax scheme. They bear no relation to the level of council tax subsidy, which under the current system is paid by councils and reclaimed from central Government. If the Minister was telling the House and telling me, as one of the MPs representing Rotherham, that there will be no cut in the pot available for council tax benefit payments next year compared with this year, I will willingly give way to him, but I think he was using those figures to make a completely different case, entirely separate from the challenge that Rotherham and every other council will face next year because of the decision taken, as he admitted tonight, for the purposes of crude deficit reduction, not as a bold local and localising reform. The Minister has not accepted my offer to give way, so I take it that he accepts the case I made and is not able to sustain the impression that he gave the House earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.892.0/5">The problem faced by many of the poorest non-pensioners is that they will lose the most, as the Government tell councils to protect pensioners and make everybody else worse off&#8212;in other words, penalise everybody else and protect pensioners. That cannot be done without causing significant pain for many non-pensioners because the overall sum available, irrespective of need or entitlement under the current system, will be cut by &#163;500 million next April.</p>

	<p pid="b.893.1/1">The hon. Gentleman must not have been listening carefully, because that is not the case my hon. Friend was making. His point was that providing special protection for pensioners when &#163;500 million is being cut overnight from the available fund means that those people who are not pensioners but who are currently entitled to council tax benefit or council tax support will inevitably be hit harder. Local authorities and charities are making the same case, as did Barnsley Advice Network to me last week when we discussed the potential challenges and problems that people will be forced to face.</p>

	<p pid="b.893.2/1">I apologise for coming late to the debate. I had a meeting elsewhere in the Palace.</p>
	<p pid="b.893.2/2">My right hon. Friend is making a pertinent point. Is he aware of the work done by the House of Commons Scrutiny Unit, which has estimated the impact of a 10% cut to council tax benefit, with protection for the over-65s, using DWP figures? It calculates that non-pensioners will face an average cut of 16% in their council tax support.</p>

	<p pid="b.894.0/1">I am glad to see my hon. Friend in his place. He has been an active participant in all debates on the Bill, including on Second Reading and in Committee. I have seen that work by the House of Commons Scrutiny Unit, which I think is useful and supports the point I am making to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)</phrase>. If anything, the 16% figure is probably on the conservative side. My local authority in Rotherham calculates that non-protected, non-pensioner claimants of council tax benefit are likely to lose, on average, 19% of their support.</p>

	<p pid="b.894.1/1">To clarify my earlier point for the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington, who is obviously having problems with earwax tonight, I was not suggesting that pensioners should be taken out of that protection; I was making exactly the same point as my right hon. Friend is making. The fact of the matter is that the hon. Gentleman will go into the Lobby tonight to vote for some swingeing cuts to the lowest paid, including some of his constituents in Manchester, who no doubt will have their revenge at the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="b.894.2/1">My hon. Friend makes clearly and succinctly the points he made earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.894.2/2">I am concerned about the percentages, whether 16% or 19%, and the averages, such as the LGA&#8217;s calculation that non-pensioners are likely to lose, on average, &#163;6 a week from the support they currently receive to help pay council tax. Percentages and averages are one thing, but the family, household or individual&#8212;the one in eight people currently entitled to council tax benefit who are in work but do not earn enough to cover their council tax bills without help&#8212;will face a reduction of perhaps &#163;10, &#163;12 or &#163;15 a week, at a time when other costs are being loaded on them and they are struggling to make ends meet. They will find such a difference really hard to deal with. I hope that we do not lose sight of the sort of pressure that the Bill and the changes the Government are making will put on many households, including many that are working hard and have an entitlement that they simply will not have under the new system.</p>

	<p pid="b.894.3/1">My right hon. Friend, as ever, speaks with great clarity and integrity. The core of the issue, as he is showing, is that it appears that there will be unintended consequences that create a disincentive to work for those very people.</p>

	<p pid="b.894.4/1">I wonder&#8212;are they unintended consequences? If they are, the degree of negligence in the legislation is unforgivable. If they were foreseen and have been calculated as part of the legislation, that speaks volumes about the &#8220;doublethink&#8221; and &#8220;doublespeak&#8221; that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>, quoting Orwell, talked about earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.894.4/2">The Government are making a pious claim to be on the side of those who are struggling but who are trying to do the right thing by staying in work in order to support themselves and their families, but those people will find it much harder from next year as a result of the changes that are going ahead. In Rotherham, just over 2,600 people are in that position, in Barnsley, just over 2,200, and across South Yorkshire there are more than</p>

	<p pid="b.895.0/1">I wholly concur with my right hon. Friend&#8217;s argument. Does not he, like me, think it extraordinary that the Government, when they first announced the proposals, said specifically that they intended the reduction not to create any work disincentives? That has now disappeared from the rhetoric&#8212;they appear to have forgotten that objective entirely. Given their overall approach and the rhetoric they are adopting in relation to other benefit changes, such as saying that they are on the side of people in work, is it not extraordinary that they are now explicitly accepting the fact that this measure will create serious work disincentives?</p>

	<p pid="b.895.1/1">I hesitate to disagree with my right hon. Friend, but I am not sure that they have forgotten it, because earlier the Minister said from the Dispatch Box that the scheme will somehow preserve work incentives. The whole design of the proposal, the framing of the legislation and everything the Government have published do not match the claims he has made from the Dispatch Box. They are hollow words that will hurt many people who are working at the moment and others who are not pensioners but who rely on the council tax benefit to help make ends meet, week to week and month to month.</p>

	<p pid="b.895.4/1">I was going to intervene on the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s last point, but I am happy to respond to the other one as well. On the last point, it is absolutely not the case that the Government have made explicit anything relating to disadvantaging working recipients. On the contrary, the statement of intent&#8212;I appreciate that he might not have got to this section&#8212;makes it clear that it is important for schemes devised by local authorities to link with universal credit and preserve exactly that protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.4/2">On the other point, Rotherham council, according to the figures it submitted to the Department, will lose approximately &#163;1.8 million of funding, but the discounts and exemptions that it will be able to recover in future will amount to &#163;1.9 million. That is all in the Bill before the House today. Whether the council chooses to join those two things together is a matter for it, but it is absolutely the case that, taking the Bill as a whole, the council will in fact have a greater capacity to meet the needs of the people it serves.</p>

	<p pid="b.895.5/1">The Minister has just told the House and me that, to run the new scheme from April next year, Rotherham will have available no less funding than it has during this financial year. I will look very carefully at the facts, and, if they match the Minister&#8217;s words, I will welcome them; if they do not, I shall demand that he puts the House straight and offers an apology.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/2">On work incentives, will not the Secretary of State therefore use his powers under schedule 4 to specify that people in work must, and work incentives will, be protected as he proposes, and has pledged, to use them for pensioners? If that is the case, the Minister&#8217;s actions will match his words. If that is not the case, exhortations on the importance of local government schemes reflecting needs and not damaging work incentives will not be worth the paper of the circular on which they are sent out, because there will be no protections guaranteeing the preservation of work incentives until and unless the Secretary of State chooses to use his powers as he has pledged to use them for pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/3">Until that point, it is reasonable for Opposition Members, who are concerned about the future of this support for council tax payments, to continue to press the Minister and to be concerned that non-pensioners are likely to bear a heavy cut in their current support. Those on low incomes who are not pensioners, but who would get the full council tax benefit under the current system, will, as the Barnsley advice network has told me, have to find 20% of their council tax bill from their basic income, whatever they earn, as councils try to make less go further.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/4">The Minister is old enough, experienced enough and has been involved in local government long enough for this measure to sound a warning to him and his colleagues. This is the return of the poll tax&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> There are a few groans from Tory Members, but let us remember that a 20% minimum payment expected of all people, whatever their means, was part of the flaw in, and at the heart of the unfairness of, the community charge a couple of decades ago. In practice, that is what we are building in for non-pensioners: a requirement to cover for themselves, whatever their income, about 20% of the council tax costs in their local area.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/5">Given the way in which the measure will work for many, it is a return of the poll tax: rushed into law and rushed into practice, with a deaf ear to local government, to charities, to experts and to Members, who warn the Government, &#8220;You&#8217;re pushing too far, too fast with these changes.&#8221; I will return in a moment to the amendments on the legislation&#8217;s commencement tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, but first let me do my job and introduce new clause 2 and the amendments that stand in my name.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/6">With new clause 2 and amendment 2, I seek to challenge the Secretary of State&#8217;s powers over, and prescription of, the new council tax support schemes. My purpose is this: I believe that the House and local government require a justification for the inclusion in this Bill of such powers of prescription from the centre over the local, otherwise their removal from the Bill is justified. None of the arguments that I have heard from Ministers, on Second Reading, in Committee or today, justifies the extent of the centralised powers vested in the Secretary of State to design and to enforce a particular manner of council tax support scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.5/7">The Government claim that the reform is a localising one. If it is, they should localise the decisions on the design of, and procedure for preparing, the scheme. They should localise the decisions and let the local authorities that will run the scheme devise them, in the Minister&#8217;s words, to suit local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.896.0/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right that any system has to be flexible enough to ensure that, if there are changes in demand locally, the system</p>
	<p pid="b.896.0/2">can catch up with the increase, but is not the concern that the Government&#8217;s proposals are completely inflexible, and that any increase in demand will impact on local services?</p>

	<p pid="b.897.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Any increase in need, demand and, as a consequence, cost will all have to be borne by the local authority&#8212;borne by switching funding from other budgets that perhaps support important local services, or borne by cutting back within the council tax support scheme the support that is paid to those who remain eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/2">However, I want to exemplify the challenge that the Minister faces to justify the powers that the Secretary of State is taking in the Bill in order to prescribe from the centre. In paragraph 3(4) of schedule 4, the Secretary of State may make regulations on the procedure for preparing the scheme, including in paragraph 3(5) regulations to</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/3">&#8220;require the authority to produce documents of a particular description&#8221;;</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/4">regulations to</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/5">&#8220;include requirements as to the form and content of documents produced in connection with the preparation of the scheme&#8221;;</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/6">regulations on the</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/7">&#8220;requirements&#8230;about the manner in which such documents must be published&#8221;;</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/8">regulations to</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/9">&#8220;require the authority to make copies of such documents available&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/10">in certain ways, and &#8220;to supply&#8221; copies of such documents to certain people; and even regulations to prescribe the charges that local councils should make for those documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/11">In all honesty, that is the sort of prescription we expect to find in a memorandum from a publications manager to a graphic designer and a press officer, not from central Government to elected local government officials throughout England. If the Minister and the Secretary of State are to have any credibility on the claim that this is a localising move and a localising measure, they should back off and guarantee what they say. If the schemes should be under local control, as the Minister and Secretary of State claim, the Government should give local authorities the powers to control them, not take those powers and exercise them from the centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/12">Amendment 1, which is also in my name, is in the same vein although more moderate, because it seeks simply to require the Secretary of State to consult before making any changes to the requirements that he chooses to impose nationally on local schemes. As the Bill stands, there is not even any obligation to consult local government on the requirements that central Government impose.</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/13">Paragraphs (8) and (9) of schedule 4 make it clear that the Secretary of State may make regulations to require any matter to be included in the design of a local scheme; may prescribe any class of person to be included in the scheme; may prescribe the reductions that cover any class in any area; and, to reinforce my earlier point, may prescribe the way in which the provisions are made. That completely undermines not only the constant mantra of Ministers across the range of their departmental responsibilities but the specific pledge</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/14">that they made in their response to the consultation, where, on page 2, they said that this is</p>
	<p pid="b.897.0/15">&#8220;a policy of decentralisation that will give local authorities increased financial freedoms&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.898.1/1">To be honest, no Minister of any Government is immune to that temptation. I am sure that it would be possible for the Minister to find one or two examples where I myself might have made such moves as a Local Government Minister. However, we in this House have a right to challenge the Government on what they claim is the underpinning principle of the Bill and to point out how the principles they claim are not matched in their legislation. There is a strong, principled case for the Secretary of State to back off, loosen the reins, and let those in local government devise the schemes that they will be obliged and required to run.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.1/2">There is a principled case and a practical case for the amendments. If the Government are able to set the key constraints and parameters of any scheme, and to do so at any time, it is entirely possible not only that local flexibility&#8212;the ability to tailor to local circumstances&#8212;will be undermined, but that local authorities will devise their schemes, set about implementing them, and then find that they have to revise them because the Secretary of State has decided to step in and make regulations under the many regulation-making powers that he has available to him in this primary legislation. If it is pensioners today, could it be carers tomorrow and ex-service personnel the day after?</p>

	<p pid="b.898.5/1">Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker, I had better not pursue that. However, it is certainly true that given their drubbing a couple of weeks ago, the Liberal Democrats will have to chase votes wherever they can find them.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.5/2">Amendment 1 is designed to challenge the Government to concede, and to give a commitment to this House, that should they use their powers under the Bill and make stipulations about the schemes that local authorities will run, they will at least consult local government before doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.5/3">Amendment 3, which also stands in my name, exemplifies my belief that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich argued, this is a rushed reform that has been introduced without an ear to proper consultation or a thought to the consequences. The amendment attempts to flush out whether the Government have properly considered the impact of the Bill in relation to the provisions of the Localism Act 2011, which allows a local authority, in setting its budget and its council tax, to put to the vote in a referendum a level of council tax that it might want to propose for its area, and allows local residents to veto what they may regard as excessive council tax rises. Under those powers, a local authority must hold a referendum no later than the first Thursday in May of the financial year to which the council tax would relate. In practice, that means that a local authority will have to run contingency spending plans, budgets and council tax levels until the result of the referendum is known, and if it is unsuccessful, those contingency budgets will need to be put in place and new council tax bills issued. That process must take place around the turn of the financial year, and by early May at the latest, yet the Bill requires that the council tax support scheme must be designed and in place by January&#8212;before most local authorities finalise and agree their budgets and council tax levels, and certainly before the level in any referendum might be established.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.5/4">That mismatch indicates that this reform is ill thought out, rushed and likely to be wrong, and it reinforces the arguments that my right hon. Friend made about his amendments 6, 7, 10 and 13, to which my name has been added. There are good reasons for making this part of the benefits system local, but there is no justification for doing it by making harsh cuts to the national and local totals of spend available, by capping the totals against any future rise in needs or costs, by requiring local councils to carry all the risk of any increases in claims, or by forcing very big cuts in council tax support for many of those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.5/5">When we last debated this in Committee in January, my right hon. Friend and I noted that councils were faced with an extraordinarily tight timetable of 12 months until the point at which they would have to have these new schemes in place. That period is now eight months. There is no time to consult local residents, to design the computer software systems necessary to run these schemes or to test them and put them into practice, to work out how the tapers to the new universal credit system will have to work with the council tax support system, or to plan for the new local scheme in the context of next year&#8217;s budget planning by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.898.5/6">This is a disaster waiting to happen. The Government have not done the work needed for local government to do the work that it needs to do. I say this to Ministers: take a leaf out of the Health Secretary&#8217;s book, pause, listen, and be prepared to put back the start of this scheme from April next year to April 2014.</p>

	<p pid="b.899.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>, whose speech was not only very passionate but extremely well informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/2">Nothing could illustrate better what a shambles of a Bill this is than the seriousness of the new clauses and amendments that the Government have tabled at this late stage. It is, frankly, a gross discourtesy to the House</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/3">to bring these issues before us with little notification and little opportunity to discuss them. Because we have not been allowed to take evidence on the Bill, we have had no evidence on the new clauses. We would have benefited from evidence on them, particularly from legal experts. Although the Minister assures us that the new clauses replicate powers that are already in existence, that is debatable. He could not answer a number of the questions that were put to him about how inaccuracy in data records could be challenged, which electronic records could be accessed under the powers, and how the powers would relate to a person&#8217;s personal electronic data that are held on their own PC.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/4">Every council will, of course, need the right system in place to tackle fraud&#8212;nobody would argue otherwise. However, it is interesting that we have heard nothing from the Government in this debate about the reductions in council staff, which are making it much more difficult to tackle fraud, or their desire to abolish the Audit Commission, which is the very body that searches out fraud and assists local councils in tackling it.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/5">I am concerned about some of the measures in the new clauses. Some of them do indeed replicate those in the Social Security Administration Act 1992. However, the Minister cannot explain how one can commit an offence other than dishonestly and he cannot explain the offence of</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/6">&#8220;allowing a person to fail to notify&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/7">something. What on earth does that mean? Does one have to be under duress, or not? What is the definition of the word &#8220;allowing&#8221;? What kind of proof is required? Above all, what will the defence against those offences be? That is not clear from what is before us. I want to see dishonest people banged up in prison or fined, but I want people who have made an honest mistake to have a proper defence for any charges that are brought against them. It is a great shame that we were not allowed to discuss the new clauses in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/8">I want to concentrate on new clause 5, which I tabled with my right hon. and hon. Friends. The Government&#8217;s plans for council tax and what we have heard from them today clearly demonstrate how remote they are from the realities of life for many people in this country. They propose to take money away from some of the poorest people, including, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, people who go to work every day to earn their poverty. People with disabilities and families with children will pay the price for the incompetence of the Government. Many of them will already have lost tax credits or disability living allowance, which is being cut by &#163;2.7 billion. It is estimated that about 400,000 disabled people will lose employment and support allowance when it is time-limited to one year for people who have paid national insurance contributions. Those very people will be hit again by the Government&#8217;s plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/9">The Government consultation document said that they would</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/10">&#8220;seek to ensure that the most vulnerable in society, in particular low income pensioners, are protected&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/11">Pensioners are indeed protected from the cuts, and we do not disagree with that. However, coupled with the 10% cut in the amount that is available, that means that other people, many of whom are equally vulnerable, will face council tax increases. That is something that the Liberal Democrats do not seem to understand, but it is simple mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/12">The Government&#8217;s default scheme in their so-called statement of intent replicates the current scheme and gives protection to many more vulnerable groups. The intent, I suppose, is to penalise councils financially. However, it is difficult to argue that we should protect vulnerable groups in the default scheme, but not legislate for that protection elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/13">There is no protection for people with disabilities&#8212;not even for those who are placed in the support group for ESA. Those people are, by definition, unable to seek work, even if it was available, which is not likely given the current flatlining economy. There is no protection for people placed in the work-related activity group, who are not expected to</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/14">&#8220;seek paid employment to increase their income&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/15">They are asked to take steps to increase their employability, but they are not yet expected to seek work. That shows how spurious is the Government&#8217;s claim that they are doing this to spur on local councils to get people into work. That is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="b.899.0/16">There is no protection for carers, as defined in the regulations on national insurance credits. That means people who provide care for at least 20 hours a week to one or more disabled person who is in receipt of certain benefits. Those people carry burdens that most of us cannot manage, and yet they do it every day. They save this country millions of pounds that would otherwise be spent on residential care.</p>

There were 2,860 such people in Stockport, which is the area that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> represents. That is more than 743,000 people who the Minister for Housing and Local Government does not think exist. They do not go to Tory fundraisers, I suppose, or attend the black and white ball. All the time, his implication has been that council tax benefit goes only to those not in work. The further implication, of course, is that they are deliberately not in work, which is what underlies most of what he says. Coming from a Government who preside over unemployment of 2.6 million, that is breathtaking arrogance.</p>

	<p pid="b.902.5/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. We can go through every local authority in England and find a number of such people.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/2">It is not just people in work and on low wages who will be affected but disabled people deemed unable to seek work, carers, and part-time workers who do not even show up in the figures. An increasing number of people are being forced to seek part-time employment, and they will pay the price of the Government&#8217;s cuts.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/3">As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> said, there is a form of &#8220;doublethink&#8221;. The Minister for Housing and Local Government told the Select Committee that people could be protected by</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/4">&#8220;getting economic activity going so there are jobs.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/5">The Government are prone to lecturing everybody on getting economic activity going. They lecture councils and the European Union, but the one set of people they do not seem to lecture is themselves. They have no plan for growth at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/6">Many people in receipt of council tax benefit are in work or not expected to seek work because of their circumstances. For them, the cut will depend not on their individual circumstances but on where they live and, crucially, how many pensioners there are in their local authority area. That varies hugely from one area to another. Claimants of non-working age make up 34% of the total in East Dorset. In Tower Hamlets, the figure is 68%.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/7">The benefit cut that people receive could vary between 13% and 25%. The worst thing about it is that it is entirely arbitrary, with no pretence of fairness whatever. In fact, in their recently published statements the Government have explicitly rejected the idea of taking into account the number of pensioners in a local authority area when setting the funding level. Many Government Members will have cause to regret that in future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/8">As some of the Opposition amendments point out, the new system will hit not only those in work or unable to work but those seeking work. The Government have been in such a rush to bring it in that they have failed to align it with universal credit, to which the Minister referred earlier. If they are so keen to have universal credit, they should have waited to align council tax benefit with it. Their own consultation document acknowledged the problem, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/9">&#8220;There is a risk, however, that some of the advantages from the single Universal Credit taper&#8230;could be lost if there is a separate and overlapping withdrawal of council tax support through localised schemes. This would produce a marginal deduction rate higher than 76%&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/10">If millionaires were having to put up with that, the Government would be rushing in to rescue them. What sort of Government include those warnings in the consultation and then ignore them? They are either incompetent or vicious&#8212;one or the other. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Both, somebody says, and I am beginning to think so.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/11">As we have seen with business rates, the areas in greatest need will be hit hardest. Let us take the impact on people in work as an example. In Liverpool, there are 6,570 people in work and receiving council tax benefit. In Durham, there are 5,810, in Birmingham a whopping 16,780 and in Hackney 7,910. Just down the road in the City of London, there are precisely 40. In Purbeck there are 580, in Runnymede there are 610 and in Wokingham&#8212;I could not pass up another chance to mention Wokingham &#8212;there are 780.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/12">This change is a triple whammy for the poorest areas. First, it will mean that local authorities with more people in work and receiving council tax benefit face a much bigger risk of default in their council tax collection. Secondly, it will make it much harder for them to mitigate the effect of the cut on people of working age. Thirdly, there will be a bigger impact on their local</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/13">economy, because money will be taken from people who would otherwise go out and spend it. It will come as no surprise to my right hon. and hon. Friends to hear that the New Policy Institute estimates that five of the 10 hardest-hit local authorities will be among the top 10 most deprived in the country&#8212;Hackney, Newham, Liverpool, Islington and Knowsley.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/14">In the Liverpool city region, it is estimated that the Government&#8217;s proposals will result in cuts of 17.23% for those who are not pensioners. In Halton, a single person will have to find at least &#163;179 more each year. In Sefton, which has a higher than average number of pensioners, a couple in a band A property will have to find an extra &#163;226 a year. That is probably small change to Government Members, but to people who struggle to keep their heads above water&#8212;those who have to count every penny to get to the end of the week without getting into debt, and without being driven into the arms of the loan sharks who are on many of our estates and ready to batten on vulnerable people&#8212;it is the difference between surviving and not surviving.</p>
	<p pid="b.902.5/15">I sometimes wonder what Ministers know of that world. Have they ever stood in a supermarket watching people put things back because they cannot afford to pay for everything in the basket? Do they understand the struggle that some families have if a child needs a new pair of shoes? They know nothing of it, and they have no wish to understand it.</p>

	<p pid="b.904.1/1">My right hon. Friend is entirely right. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The Under-Secretary says that it is because they think the measures are right. Well, if I cannot appeal to their moral sense, let me try appealing to their economic sense. The poorest areas will have the biggest hit to their local economies. The 2010-11 figures show that a 10% cut will mean &#163;10 million being taken out of Birmingham, &#163;6.1 million out of Liverpool, &#163;3 million out of Newham, &#163;2.7 million out of Newcastle and &#163;2.9 million out of Gateshead. By contrast, the prosperous local economies lose less. Runnymede will lose &#163;454,000; Wokingham &#163;518,000; Melton more than &#163;246,000; and Hart &#163;293,000; but&#8212;as we might expect with this Government, this is a big &#8220;but&#8221;&#8212;that is not the whole story.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/2">The figures I gave were calculated on payments made in 2010-11, as given in a parliamentary answer by the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate. The total paid to councils in Great Britain in that year in council tax benefit was &#163;4.8 billion. In their consultation on funding, the Government promised to give 90% of the forecast council tax expenditure for 2013-14, but they expect council tax benefit to have miraculously decreased by then to a total of &#163;4.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/3">How did the Government arrive at that assumption? Considering unemployment levels and what is happening to the economy, we might expect council tax claims to</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/4">go up rather than down. Perhaps that figure was calculated on the earlier optimistic forecasts that the Government gave us, but they have had to be adjusted. Councils should be warned, however, that they might face more than the cut they are expecting. Even with the so-called minor adjustments the Government want to introduce to the distribution of funding, and the creation of ceilings and floors, we do not expect too much difference. We have heard those promises before in local government finance settlements, and the measures still ended up hitting the poorest most.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/5">Moreover if, as the Under-Secretary appeared to suggest, vulnerable people ought to have more protection&#8212;I assume he was referring to those on passported benefits&#8212;why could the working poor be facing cuts of up to 40% in their benefits, which would wipe out any gains from the increase in personal allowances that he trumpets? In face, those gains have been wiped out already by rising VAT, the loss of tax credit, changes to housing benefits and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/6">I know the Minister is anxious for good news&#8212;if the Labour party had lost to Professor Pingu the penguin, I would be looking for some good news&#8212;but his proposal will not run, because like most Lib Dem policies it is little more than a headline for the latest hocus-pocus. Indeed, far from councils being given more freedom, they will bear all the financial risks and most of the public anger for the policy. The Government have carefully ensured that the increased bills dropping through doors will bear the imprint of the local council, not that of the Secretary of State. Councils will pay the price if it goes wrong. The Select Committee on Communities and Local Government called it</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/7">&#8220;an illusion of delegation with a minimum of real discretion&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/8">We know, for instance, that only between 57% and 66% of pensioners claim their benefit. The likelihood is that the number claiming the benefit will increase when it is shown as a discount on a bill rather than as a benefit. That is a good thing, but councils must bear the burden of the extra cost. Increased unemployment in a council area, especially from the closure of a large company, will mean that council tax benefit claims increase. What will happen then?</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/9">The Government want to include council tax support in their business rate retention scheme, but what is the consequence of that? According to the Government&#8217;s consultation, a local authority will come into the safety net category only if its revenues fall by between 7.5% and 10% below the baseline, which is a massive fall before getting any support.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/10">This is the crux of the matter. The Government have said that the measure will inspire councils to create employment and get more people into jobs, but how do councils do that in a double-dip recession? The Government have an in-built belief that local authorities do not want to encourage economic growth, but I challenge the Minister to name one, as I have throughout debates on the Bill. I am willing to give way to him if he wants to name one, but he cannot do so. Local councils have not caused the double-dip recession; the Government have. It is not local authorities that are causing firms to go into administration, but the economic failure of the Chancellor, who seems to have been too busy entertaining Rebekah Brooks at Dorneywood to notice what is happening to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/11">The poorest areas are likely to face the greatest rise in claims and have already had their budgets cut. There is no slack in the system and no money to be transferred from elsewhere. The Opposition&#8217;s greatest fear is that some local authorities will try to manage the system by driving down claims and deterring people from claiming. I have confidence that Labour authorities will not do that&#8212;thankfully, there are many more Labour authorities than there were when debates on the Bill began&#8212;but I have little confidence in Tory and Lib Dem authorities. Equally, setting up an appeals system and dealing with what is likely to be a higher level of default will incur costs for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.904.1/12">New clause 5 is designed to ensure that the Government cannot ignore those impacts. It is no good the Minister telling us that there will be reviews, because those reviews do not include people in work and in poverty or those looking for work and in poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.906.0/1">My hon. Friend makes excellent points, but on the confusion in the appeals process it is not yet clear whether council tax benefit staff will be employed in future by the Department for Work and Pensions under the universal credit or within local authorities. That changeover adds to the complexity and confusion.</p>

	<p pid="b.906.1/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. Even if we supported the Government&#8217;s changes in the Bill, their failure to align the changes with universal credit will cause chaos throughout the system, including for staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/2">Many Government amendments relate to Wales, which the Government forgot about when they drafted the Bill&#8212;to lose a county is unfortunate; to lose a whole country is rather careless&#8212;but the Welsh Government have said they are profoundly concerned by the plan. Some 327,000 people in Wales will be affected, whom the Government also seem to have forgotten about&#8212;they have developed a habit of absent-mindedly mislaying citizens, such as those in work or those who happen to live in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/3">The Government have tabled a series of amendments on council tax reduction schemes and default schemes, which could have been discussed properly had draft regulations been brought before the House, as the Minister promised us on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase>. Instead, we are once again being asked to grant wide powers to the Secretary of State without any idea how they will be exercised, which is extremely worrying and a poor way to make legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/4">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich raised the rushed implementation of the proposals, an important problem we raised in Committee. Last week, we received statements of intent, but not the draft regulations we were promised. I get the feeling the Government are simply not ready to implement the proposals. It is as if someone, somewhere in the Department for Communities and Local Government&#8212;I suspect the Minister for Housing and Local Government&#8212;had a wizard wheeze and said, &#8220;I know. Let&#8217;s cut council tax benefit,&#8221; but did not work out the details. The Government, following the example set by the Prime Minister, do not seem to do detail. They just wave a languid hand and say, &#8220;Detail will follow.&#8221; But, in government, details matter. They affect the lives of the people whom we represent. The Bill will result in enormous changes for</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/5">local authorities, which are being asked to cope with changes to non-domestic rates and with the localisation of council tax benefit, all at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/6">By next year, local authorities will have to be ready to run their own local schemes, yet the Bill was rushed with indecent haste through the Committee&#8212;because the Government did not appear to understand the rules for carrying over a Bill&#8212;then kept hanging about like some kind of slow-cooking stew until after the Queen&#8217;s Speech. It will not have a Second Reading in the other place until, I believe, <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-12">12 June</phrase>, and its first Committee sitting there is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-03">3 July</phrase>. If, as I am told, the other place will not be sitting in September, who knows when the Bill will complete its passage?</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/7">Amendments will have to come back here, and if they are not agreed to&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> talks about the recess, but he has perhaps forgotten that this House is sitting in September, although the other place does not appear to be doing so. That is the kind of detail that matters when we are trying to get legislation through. There could well be ping-pong between the two Houses. Regulations will also have to be set and passed by both Houses. In the meantime, councils are being expected to draw up a scheme without knowing the precise rules that they will need to follow, and with no certainty about their funding. That is not sensible government&#8212;it is pass-the-buck government.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/8">We have also heard about the difficulty of producing the software required to implement the changes. Councils will need to be very clear about what they want from the firms that are designing that software, but they do not have the necessary information at the moment. Why are the Government so determined to meet the 2013 date that they will not listen either to local authorities or to the experts who design the system? I would call them pig-headed, but that would probably be unfair to pigs. Why are they so keen to impose cuts on the poorest people and chaos on local authorities? We know the answer: it is simply that they are out of touch.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/9">The people who will suffer are the poorest people. Councils are in a no-win situation. If they protect vulnerable groups other than pensioners, those in work or seeking work will face even larger reductions in their income. This Government believe that the poor must pay for the poor, while tax cuts are given to the rich. They believe that the living standards of those who have very little have to be cut, while bankers in partly state-owned banks swan off for courses on executive nutrition at a spa. I am sure that many of the poorest people in this country would love to have to worry about the type of nutrition that they got; most of them have to settle for what they can afford.</p>
	<p pid="b.906.1/10">The Government do not call the money given to bankers a handout, but that is what they call the money given to local councils. They do not call their tax cuts for millionaires a handout, but that is the term they use for the money they give to local councils to run essential services. This is a Government without a proper sense of direction and without a proper sense of right and wrong. We will continue to monitor the effects of the Bill. We will press our amendments to the vote, and we will ensure that the plight of the poorest people who are being hit by these provisions is not forgotten. It is for that reason that I urge my hon. Friends to vote in support of new clause 5.</p>

	<p pid="b.908.5/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure that the opportunity to give way will arise, and I shall certainly do so in due course to those who think that there is anything to be said against our view that the Bill represents a significant localisation for local government and local communities. The return of business rates to local authorities, the capacity to set council tax without having capping limits set by the Secretary of State, and the transfer of the benefits system to local authorities are all significant measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.908.5/2">I want to restate my point about the return to local authorities of the ability to set council tax discounts. If every local authority chose to exercise the changes that are being passed into their hands, that would generate for English local authorities a total of more than &#163;400 million. There is no direct connection in the Bill, but I want to make it clear that, whatever might be said about the proposals in the Bill, that discount change will be of significant benefit to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.908.5/3">I shall deal with some of the points raised in the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> suggested that we ought to accept at least some of his amendments, simply because they were already in the Government&#8217;s plans. Well, it is because they are already in the Government&#8217;s plans that we do not need to accept them. Some of his other amendments were intended to dismantle the Bill and its provisions, but I made it clear that this is not just a localism measure but a component part of putting our finances right. At no point have we disguised the fact that localisation and deficit reduction are both involved in the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.909.1/1">I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way. He keeps using the word &#8220;localisation&#8221;, but it is obvious that what he is doing is localising cuts. He has spoken about raising &#163;400 million and about the empty homes premium and the council tax discounts. Why are central Government being prescriptive about such measures? Why are they stating that homes must have been empty for two years? Why will they not give local authorities the power to decide how long a home needs to have been empty in order to qualify for the empty homes premium?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.909.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="909"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0003.htm#12052132000573">
	<p pid="b.909.2/1">The flexibility on discounts will apply to all empty homes from day one, not just to those that have been empty for two years. The two-year condition relates to the empty homes premium, which is a separate provision that is being put in the hands of councils by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> made some interesting points, but he did not seem to be aware that, whereas Wokingham has the capacity to generate &#163;700,000 extra income, Wigan, which he mentioned specifically, has the capacity to generate &#163;2.2 million from the discounts. If Wigan chose to implement those measures, that would completely offset the funding gap he talked about.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/3">To be clear, much of the shroud-waving from the Opposition is completely misplaced. It was strange that the hon. Member for North Durham argued&#8212;although he tried to back out of it&#8212;for additional cuts in council tax benefit for pensioners, because he wants councils to have the flexibility to switch their spending on pensioners to others whom he thinks are more worthy of protection. That is a point of view, but it is not one that the Government share.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/4">I have a lot of time for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>. He served time in the Treasury, during which I believe he was party to the introduction of the 10p tax rate&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> We all have skeletons we wish we could keep in the cupboard. When it comes to protecting the low-paid, it is this Government who have raised tax thresholds for low-paid people, many of whom are women, of course, and will take 2 million people out of tax over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/5">The right hon. Gentleman did get round to welcoming the localism measure, but&#8212;not for the first time&#8212;he wants localism, but not yet. The Opposition do not have a strong track record on localism, but they have realised just how important it is to the people we represent. They now pay lip service to it at every opportunity, but I see no sign that it goes beyond lip service to their agreeing to implement localism in practice. At every turn, they try to delay, dismantle and divert the successful attempts of the Government to localise decision making and give local communities the power to take decisions about their services.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/6">I answered the right hon. Gentleman regarding Rotherham&#8217;s figures. He mentioned Barnsley, and its figures are an almost exactly equal balance, just slightly in favour of Barnsley, with &#163;1.6 million in each direction. He also waxed lyrical about the new clause 2 single</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/7">person discount. Some 29% of households are single person, and another 7% are single-parent households. I do not believe that he would want to put those people under additional pressure. The Government do not accept that new clause 2 is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/8">The right hon. Gentleman also made an interesting point, of the kind that only a former Secretary of State might make, about what would happen if a council tax referendum failed and the impact that would have on the scheme. The scheme that a local authority sets up by <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-31">31 January</phrase> each year will have statutory force and cannot be changed for the following 12 months, so it would be required to be considered in any reduced budget. Of course, when a local council sets up its scheme, it will be with the full knowledge of its intended settlement. As I say, the right hon. Gentleman welcomes localism, but he does not want it yet.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/9">I draw to the attention of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the hon. Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> one of the documents we published last week, &#8220;Localising Support for Council Tax: Vulnerable people&#8212;key local authority duties&#8221;, which sets out clearly the factors that a local authority needs to have in mind when it exercises its discretion and introduces a scheme. When she studies that, she will find that many of the questions that she raised are answered and her concerns are dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/10">The hon. Lady commented on the introduction of the Welsh Assembly clauses. She will know from what the Government said previously that we took the time to consult with our colleagues in the Welsh Administration, and it is at their behest that the clauses take their present form. That is an example of the Government taking a measured approach, consulting with the relevant bodies and introducing proposals entirely in accordance with the Welsh Administration&#8217;s views.</p>
	<p pid="b.909.2/11">The hon. Lady also drew attention to an amendment on consulting with those affected. There is a requirement on local authorities, when they have drawn up their scheme, to consult with those whom they believe will be affected. That clearly will involve a consultation with all the groups the hon. Lady mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="b.910.0/1">I apologise for not being here earlier, but I was at a Select Committee meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.910.0/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> apparently raised the point about the time local authorities will have to propose a scheme, consult on it&#8212;as the Minister has just described&#8212;and then get their providers of services, such as Capita, to design the schemes and implement them. In January, Capita raised concerns about the time constraints that it would face and its real worry that it would have inadequate time to do that. Is the Minister convinced that local authorities will have adequate time and that there will be no problems with the delivery of services to constituents?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.910.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="910"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0003.htm#12052132000575">
	<p pid="b.910.1/1">That is exactly why we produced the statements of intent&#8212;to give local authorities and their providers the longest possible time to understand how they might best design and develop a scheme. That is also why we have provided a significant sum of money to assist them in doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.910.1/2">The hon. Member for Warrington North also asked about criminal offences being created by the Bill. The Social Security Administration Act 1992 creates several criminal offences in relation to council tax benefit, including an offence of dishonestly making a false statement and one of knowingly making a false statement for the purpose of obtaining council tax benefit. There is a different standard of proof for each offence, as I suspect that the hon. Lady knows better than I do. Greater penalties apply if it can be shown that a person has acted dishonestly.</p>

	<p pid="b.911.0/1">Can the Minister explain what the position is when a person has not acted dishonestly? We have asked him several times. He has referred to acting knowingly and to acting dishonestly, but the proposed provisions refer to offences that can be committed other than dishonestly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.911.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="911"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0003.htm#12052132000577">
	<p pid="b.911.1/1">I am surrounded by lawyers, and the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, is giving me helpful advice, but let me say that there are two separate categories, which I think the hon. Lady has just restated: dishonestly making a false statement and knowingly making a false statement for the purpose of obtaining council tax benefit. To underline a point I made when introducing the debate, those provisions mirror and replicate the existing situation as far as the council tax benefit fraud prevention scheme is concerned. Another relevant point I made earlier is that we are conducting a full review to ensure that what is put into the new scheme is wholly proportionate to the new situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.911.1/2">These proposals are designed to localise council tax benefit and the council tax reduction scheme, are part of a much broader package of localisation to local government and are consistent with the Government&#8217;s deficit reduction plan. I commend new clause 9 and the other Government amendments and new clauses to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.923.0/1">I rise to speak to new clauses 1 and 11, and amendments 62 and 63.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/2">My purpose with new clause 1 is to encourage the Minister to confirm, on behalf of the Government, that the necessary powers exist in legislation to make tax increment financing work in future, and also to confirm Ministers&#8217; intent and commitment to using those powers. The case for TIFs&#8212;tax increment financing schemes&#8212;is unarguable. I myself have been arguing it for a number of years, first in the Treasury and then in the Department for Communities and Local Government. There are local government regulations in Scotland to allow six TIF pilots to go ahead. The use of TIFs is widespread in Canada and the US, particularly in areas where regeneration is required; indeed, only one state in the US&#8212;Arizona&#8212;does not have TIF legislation. TIFs build on the commitment that Labour made in government, in the Budget 2010, a commitment that was backed by a capital down payment of &#163;120 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/3">However, if the TIFs system is to work&#8212;that is, if local authorities are to borrow money for up-front infrastructure investment against the anticipated increase in business rate income as a result of the new infrastructure &#8212;there must above all be certainty for those long-term investments to be made. There needs to be certainty for a clear business plan and then an investment plan to be put in place; otherwise TIFs will not get off the ground and will not work. That certainty is required over a 20 to 30-year time scale, which is why it is needed in legislation. As the Centre for Cities said in response to the Government&#8217;s consultation:</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/4">&#8220;When the Government introduces Tax Increment Financing&#8230;it should be based on &#8216;Option 2&#8217;&#8212;a ringfenced TIF which is best suited for local investment finance within the proposed business rate retention system.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/5">That point was echoed by the British Property Federation, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/6">&#8220;Failing to ring-fence the income stream for that length of time&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/7">its submission referred to a 25 to 30-year period&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/8">&#8220;would generally render the upfront investment unbankable, because the risks associated with it become too difficult to model, understand and price. TIF will only work with the sort of total ring-fencing proposed under Option 2&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/9">The Government made the commitment to ring-fencing, stating in the White Paper of October 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/10">&#8220;We will introduce new borrowing powers to enable authorities to carry out Tax Increment Financing&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/11">In response to the consultation, the Government also made a commitment to</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/12">&#8220;allow a limited number of Tax Increment Financing Projects to be exempted from any levy and reset for 25 years.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/13">That is the crucial commitment that I want to test against the content of the Bill before us. I expressed my concern about the freedom of the ring-fencing from any effects of reset to the Secretary of State on Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-10">10 January</phrase>. He had no answer: either he did not know, or he did not want to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/14">Let me therefore point the Minister to the source of my concern, which relates to paragraph 37(1)(d) of schedule 1 on page 32. This deals with the regulation-making powers of the Secretary of State, referring to regulations that can</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/15">&#8220;provide for that amount or that proportion to be disregarded for the purposes of calculations under any of the following provisions&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/16">in other words, regulation-making powers that can lead to the disregard of a proportion of business rates in specified areas, namely TIF areas, for particular payments that would otherwise be due. The provision goes on to identify payments to the central share, payments by billing to precepting local authorities, levy payments, safety net payments, payments on account and payments that follow from changes either to the local government finance report or to an amending report of a local government financing report. There is no power, however, to make regulations to exempt payments as a result of changes through a reset.</p>
	<p pid="b.923.0/17">If I am mistaken, I would like the Minister to indicate where that power lies. If no such provision exists in the legislation, will he confirm that the Government will honour the commitment they made in their response to the consultation and will amend the Bill so that any payments resulting from a reset can be disregarded&#8212;and disregarded in full&#8212;for the purpose of the TIF areas? The Minister would be welcome to accept my new clause if he needs to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.924.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman has made admirably clear his concerns about the potential lack of commercial certainty. One of the advantages of going down the route of tax increment financing is that there would be ring fence over the 25 to 30-year period. Does he not see, however, that in very uncertain economic times, that is a very long period, so it might be unwise, where a major change required a major reset in a particular area, perhaps where new towns were being built, not to allow the Government a certain amount of leeway? Is that not more important than the exclusion of a reset from the ring fence?</p>

	<p pid="b.924.1/1">I would have thought the hon. Gentleman, who represents the Cities of London and Westminster, would recognise more than anyone else that for the sort of commercial investment required to get TIFs off the ground in circumscribed and specific areas, certainty is a premium. If the 25 or 30-year commitment required to make this work could be periodically completely set to one side in a reset process, I put it to him that the inherent risk created by that and the inherent lack of certainty entailed by it would undermine the ability to raise the finance necessary to get the TIFs off the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.924.1/2">As to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about new towns, the regulations allow the disregard in the specified areas that are designated as TIF areas only. The disregard on business rate payments, a proportion of which would otherwise become payable by the local authority, would be allowed under various headings, but this would not apply to the reset. Fundamentally, that is the biggest upset factor of all, so the case for disregarding that is probably stronger than it is for the smaller-beer measures for which regulations can be designed to protect.</p>

	<p pid="b.925.0/1">I accept what the right hon. Gentleman says and he is absolutely right about commercial certainty, which is of great importance to any would-be investor. Instead of the notion of absolute certainty embodied in new clause 1, would the right hon. Gentleman not be satisfied, particularly in view of the important effect of building a new town or a huge new industrial estate for which the notion of a reset would apply, by reassurances from the Minister that the Government do not intend to make the changes he has in mind? Would that not be better than going down the route of absolutely certainty, which provides little flexibility either to central or local government, for an incredibly long period of 25 or 30 years? We need go back only two and a half or three decades to recognise the great changes that have taken place in many of the industrial areas that we represent and to understand that absolute certainty of the sort that he&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.925.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I got the gist. I welcome this Bill and I want it to work. My fear is that without the certainty around potential resets&#8212;we do not know when or how often they might happen; we do not know whether they will happen every 10 years; we do not know how they will work in future&#8212;there will be huge risk and uncertainty in the system. It is not a question of whether I am satisfied by the provision; it is a question of whether the potential investors, who will determine whether the TIFs work or not, are satisfied. I am trying to convey the sentiment that I have picked up from my discussions with banks, commercial organisations, the British Property Federation and some of the City&#8217;s policy experts, who all say, &#8220;Look, we require a ring fence; it must be total&#8221;. Thus leaving out the reset, which the Government promised they would not do, does not make sense if we want the provisions to work. I hope the Minister will be able to provide the confirmation we need and be able to build it into the Bill. This issue will certainly need to be confirmed at later stages of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.925.2/2">Amendment 62 is designed to get to the heart of the relative share of the business rate take as between central and local government. The figures for projected resource spending on local government under the current spending review demonstrate a significant reduction for next year and the year after that&#8212;of nearly half a billion between this year and the next, and of more than &#163;1.5 billion between next year and the year after that in</p>
	<p pid="b.925.2/3">nominal terms. Alongside that, the projected yield from business rates is set to go up by nearly &#163;1 billion next year and by more than half a billion the year after that. That means that the gap between the projected business rates yield and central Government&#8217;s commitment to resource spending on local government is more than &#163;2 billion for next year, and &#163;4 billion for the year after that. There is a significant and growing gap between the business rates yield and spending on local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.925.2/4">I accept, as do my colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench, the need for the business rates retention system not to undermine the Chancellor&#8217;s announced plans for deficit reduction during the current spending review period. However, I do not want central Government to keep helping themselves to a growing yield from business rates after 2014-15, given that the system is designed to return that yield to local government as an incentive for it to support economic development.</p>

	<p pid="b.926.0/1">It is not yet clear how local authorities&#8217; needs will be assessed for the purpose of determining the proportion of the business rate that they will retain.

	<p pid="b.926.1/1">My hon. Friend, who has experience of local government, has put his finger on the button. What worries me is that the Bill gives the Secretary of State power to set the central and local shares&#8212;in other words, to determine the division of the business rates take&#8212;in each and every year, indefinitely. I am not talking just about what will happen next year and the year after that, or about what will happen until the end of the current spending review period. From year to year, local government simply will not know where it stands until the Secretary of State makes the decision. The central and local shares could vary, and central Government could decide to take a greater share.</p>
	<p pid="b.926.1/2">The Government&#8217;s top-slicing of at least 50% of the business rates revenue and 50% of the business rates growth above the baseline will reduce the incentives for local authorities to support growth, which were meant to be part of the design of the system. It will also reduce the certainty that would enable authorities to plan their finances on more than a year-by-year basis, and reduce the Government&#8217;s own ability to claim that this is a localising reform. I am sure that we will hear from the Minister&#8212;and I have heard this before&#8212;that the Government have declared their intention of returning the revenues in the central share to local government; but, as has been pointed out by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>, we have been given no details, and we do not know what purposes or constraints that may entail.</p>

	<p pid="b.926.2/1">My right hon. Friend has raised an important point about what the Government may choose to do with the extra money from the business rates that will accrue each year. The suspicion has been expressed that they will use it to ensure that local authorities must fund more and more council tax benefits. That would be a simple way of transferring responsibility for benefits to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.927.0/1">My hon. Friend may well be right, and his Select Committee will doubtless keep a close eye on the matter. I hope that the Minister will give us some answers tonight, but I am sure that, if he does not, Ministers in the other place will be pressed on the point.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.0/2">The other gaping hole in the Bill is the absence of any specific measure that would tell us when and how the Government would deal with the reset in the future. The two options that they presented in their statement of intent last week could lead to fundamentally different outcomes. There could be a full reset, whereby all the business rate growth up to the point of the reset was redistributed&#8212;meaning, in effect, that the baseline of the whole system would be reset by means of the new, and total, business rates pot&#8212;or there could be a partial reset, meaning that business growth would be retained at local level, and just the initial baseline would be reset. That represents a very wide range of possibilities for local authorities. If the Minister wants authorities to be able to plan for the future on the basis of the new system, he must provide them with some of the answers to such questions, sooner rather than later.</p>

	<p pid="b.927.1/1">Getting the reset procedure right is important not least because the initial baseline is so unfair. It locks in unfair local government settlements and in-year cuts. It is crucially important for local government to be certain that the reset procedure will work in the future, because otherwise the gaps will continue to widen.</p>

	<p pid="b.927.2/1">Indeed. I have my misgivings about whether any approach to the reset procedure can make the system fair after more than a few years. Indeed, I am still to be convinced that the system can be reset in a fair and proper way. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I digress beyond the scope of the amendments that I tabled.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/2">Let me now turn to amendment 63. During earlier debates on the Bill in the Chamber, I argued that this was an unsuitable system for long-term Government funding. Ultimately, business rates yield is too volatile, and it is too volatile on a year-by-year basis. Let me give three examples, a couple of which will be close to home for those on both Front Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/3">In Warrington the business rates yield has dropped by &#163;10 million over the last 10 years, from &#163;53 million to just &#163;43 million. In Sunderland there was a &#163;17 million drop between 2010 and 2011, and in the year before that there had been a &#163;12 million rise. I can tell the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, that in the middle of 2005-06, the business rates income in his borough of Bromley halved. In two of the last four years, the changes&#8212;up and down, and up and down again&#8212;have amounted to more than 10%. The funding stream is inherently volatile, and, in my view, is inherently unsuitable as a basis for the funding of essential local government services.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/4">The main purpose of amendment 63, however, is to draw attention to concern about the volatility caused by appeals. I believe that areas in which there is a particular concentration of a single or consistent business type are particularly vulnerable to a big impact from them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase>, who has just left the Chamber, may recall that in 2007-08 a full 20% of the business rates yield of</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/5">the City of London was lost as a result of successful backdated appeals. So the appeals add another important, volatile element to the system of business rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/6">Those appeals are made against decisions by the Valuation Office Agency, not local authorities. The system is managed by the VOA and tribunals, not the local authority, and it brings benefits to the companies that are successful, not the local authorities. We must ensure that the impacts of appeals do not affect the funding base of the local authorities; we must not expose authorities to vagaries in the system and to the impact of appeals, when they cannot predict them, control the risk of them or benefit from them. Actually, neither can they benefit from business rate increases through revaluation, at least while the Government put in place transition relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/7">I tabled amendment 63 because the Government are creating a one-way bet, in which the Chancellor wins each way and the councils lose each time. If the appeals are won by the company, the local authority has to manage the volatility and has to bear the loss up to the level of the safety net threshold&#8212;which, according to the statement of intent in the Government&#8217;s publications of Thursday last week, is likely to be somewhere between 7.5% and 10%. Amendment 63 is an attempt to make sure that once the calculations and the thresholds are determined, safety net payments take full account of rating appeals. Linked to that, I hope the Government will accept the case for fully compensating local authorities from the levy pot for the impact of any successful business appeals&#8212;over which they have no control, and which they cannot predict.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/8">New clause 11 is relatively modest, and I hope the Minister will accept it in principle, if not in practice at this stage. The power for setting and changing business rates policy&#8212;business rate reliefs, which are mandatory, as well as the payment schedules for business rates and the transition periods for business rate increases&#8212;will continue to rest with the Secretary of State and the national Government. Currently, any national business rate policy changes have no direct impact on local authority finances or local authority budgets. In future they will, however. They will not be local government decisions, but they will create consequences that local government will have to deal with. If the Government decide to change the rate or the type of mandatory rate reliefs, or to allow the deferral of part of the change in business rate bills, that will have a direct impact on that year&#8217;s yield in the area concerned, and therefore on the local authority&#8217;s funding. Local authorities will be hit by the consequences of decisions that they did not make and that they cannot control. That is unfair and unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/9">It may surprise some Members to learn that the Federation of Small Businesses has also made that argument. It said in response to the consultation of October 2011 that</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/10">&#8220;the FSB is concerned that the incentive system could actually deter local authorities from promoting and utilising the reliefs available to small businesses such as small business rate relief, rural rate relief and hardship relief&#8230;It would mean that a local authority would lose out on income if it increased the proportion of businesses that received rate relief or would make money if the number of businesses able to get reliefs fell.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/11">I am sure the Minister does not want to design into the new system perverse incentives that will hit small firms in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/12">As currently proposed, the new system will be bad for local authorities, and could be bad for local small and medium-sized firms. My new clause requires that, at the very least, the Secretary of State must consult the parties that would be affected by changes in national business rates policy before making such decisions. Under the new system, the stakes for councils will be higher, so the guarantee to consult them before any changes are made is the minimum that Ministers should promise.</p>

	<p pid="b.929.0/1">Once again, I am very pleased to follow an interesting, passionate and well-informed speech from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>. I can add little to the case he made for his amendments, so, given the time constraints, I shall focus on new clause 6, which stands in my name and that of other right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/2">We make no apologies for returning to the issue of need and the different levels of need within local authorities &#8212;the elephant in the room that the Government want to ignore. This issue has been raised time and again in our debates on the Bill by hon. Friends, many of whom represent some of the most deprived communities in this country and have seen at first hand the impact of the Government&#8217;s policies on those communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/3">Why are the Government so wilfully blind to the effects of their policies? They have already hit local authorities with cuts that are larger than those inflicted on any Government Department, and we have heard from Opposition Members about the real and serious impact the cuts are having on front-line services&#8212;the cuts in school food provision, increases in home care charges, library closures in the poorest communities. However, none of this has any influence on Ministers, so out of touch are they with most people&#8217;s lives, and it now appears that they are going to make things worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/4">First, they entrench unfairness in the system by basing it on the current local government finance settlement, so the inequalities and unfairness of the current scheme will form the basis of the settlement for years to come. We have heard many times during our debates on this Bill about cities that are losing spending power: Manchester is losing spending power of &#163;186 per person, Birmingham &#163;155 and Nottingham &#163;147. Those are the cities that the Government think will drive the economic recovery; there is no linked-up policy here. Wokingham, of course, gains, however. Basingstoke and Deane gains &#163;6.30 per person. East Dorset gains &#163;3 per person.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/5">According to the Government&#8217;s statement of intent&#8212;it is one of many, so I am unsure how much weight we can place on any of their statements of intent&#8212;each authority will keep 50% of its business rates and the Government will provide a revenue support grant to make up the difference between the local share of business rates at the outset of the scheme and the spending controls for local government. However, they will, it seems, have top-sliced that for the new homes bonus first, which already benefits most those authorities with a high tax base, and it appears that many other grants will also be included, as listed in the statement of intent.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/6">We already know how the grant system has been used to penalise the poorest authorities with communities that are most in need, and there has been a significant</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/7">reduction in resource equalisation. Under this scheme, the gap between richer and poorer authorities will widen. First, as the Yorkshire and Humberside councils have said,</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/8">&#8220;a baseline may not reflect the actual levels of funding councils need to deliver services from April 2013.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/9">They were right about that. Secondly, as we have discussed during the passage of this Bill, some authorities will find it easier to grow their business rates than others. It has been estimated that even if the top-ups and tariffs increased in line with the retail prices index, the gap between the richest and the poorest authorities, and between the north and the south, will widen. Cash growth in the City of London could be 139% over four years and the figure for Westminster could be 90%, whereas the estimate for Liverpool and Knowsley is 21.9% and that for South Tyneside is 22.7%.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.0/10">When we add into that this Government&#8217;s abject failure to take into account the differing tax bases of local authorities, the situation becomes even worse. That failure means that local authorities do not start on the level playing field that the Deputy Prime Minister kept telling us about&#8212;although he was the man who said he was not going to raise tuition fees, so I am not sure that anyone takes much notice of him. In the long term, fortunate local councils might reduce or even get rid of council tax, whereas others whose tax base is low and where it is harder to attract investment will be unable to do so. When we also take into account the amount that some councils will lose through changes in council tax benefit, it is clear that they could be heading for the perfect storm.</p>

	<p pid="b.930.0/1">May I use the example of my constituency to illustrate precisely the issue that my hon. Friend is raising? My constituency covers two metropolitan boroughs that lie side by side; Tameside predominantly contains band A and band B properties, so its ability to increase its income from council tax is less than that of neighbouring Stockport, which contains a much larger amount of properties in a wider range of bands. Is that not the fundamental unfairness of all this?</p>

	<p pid="b.930.1/1">It is the fundamental thing that the Government fail to understand: councils are not starting from the same baseline. Those who pay the price for these inequalities, which will increase, are those most in need. Need is the thing that the Government do not want to talk about. That is why our new clause 6 seeks to require the Government to take into account both the likely capacity of an authority to benefit from business rate growth and the authority&#8217;s level of need.</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/2">When the Secretary of State issued all these statements of intent last week, he sought to dismiss the whole concept of need. He talked of grants as a</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/3">&#8220;system of Government handouts to local authorities&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/4">He said that this</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/5">&#8220;encourages a begging bowl mentality, with each council vying to be more deprived than its neighbour.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2012-05-17.39"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 May 2012; Vol. 545, c. 39WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/6">I have never heard such an appalling slur on local councils or such an arrogant dismissal of the needs of many of the poorest people in this country, and he should apologise for that. Is he really suggesting that councils are pretending to represent areas that are poorer</p>
	<p pid="b.930.1/7">than they actually are, simply to get Government grants? That is nonsense. So why is it that under this Government the needs of people who are out of work, of people who have long-term illnesses and of people in poverty can be treated as if they do not exist? These people do not have loud voices, because most of them are just trying to get by from week to week. They do not share mulled wine and mince pies with the Prime Minister or get invited to dinner at Dorneywood. By contrast, those who pay 50% tax&#8212;millionaires, who are apparently squeezed beyond endurance&#8212;must be relieved of their burdens.</p>

	<p pid="b.931.0/1">My hon. Friend is making precisely the point that needs to be made in these debates, which is that the demands on local services vary widely and that it is often the poorest communities that have the greatest demands. I am very pleased that her proposal recognises children in care, because they are a big issue for local authorities in need. That argument needs to be made in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.931.1/1">My hon. Friend is right about that, and I shall discuss the number of people in care later. It is important that we recognise that many of the things we are discussing are statutory services, which the local authority has to provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.931.1/2">Let us examine some of the differences between areas. In Knowsley, whose case was put forcefully in Committee by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40349" name="George Howarth">the Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth)</phrase>, 58,000 people&#8212;more than one third&#8212;live in areas that are among the top five most deprived in the country. In the north-east, 32.7% of people live in the most deprived 20% of areas. Those are the areas that will struggle as the gap between needs and resources widens. Such authorities are often the same ones that are having to cope with the biggest increases in unemployment. That both reduces the finance available to local councils, because more people are claiming benefit, and increases the demand for their services.</p>
	<p pid="b.931.1/3">The Secretary of State seems to think that authorities are competing to be the most deprived, so let me ask him something&#8212;I would if he were here, but he seems to take these debates so lightly that he has not even bothered to turn up for most of this one. So let me ask this Minister: is unemployment in Birmingham, Ladywood higher or lower than in Henley? In Birmingham, Ladywood, it stands at 11.2%, whereas in Henley it is 1.1%.</p>
	<p pid="b.931.1/4">Does Middlesbrough have a higher or lower unemployment rate than North East Hampshire? Middlesbrough&#8217;s rate is 9.7%, whereas that for North East Hampshire is 1.1%. Is the figure for Liverpool, Walton higher or lower than that for Wokingham? The figure for Liverpool, Walton is 8.5%, whereas that for Wokingham is 1.3%. Does he think that councils are making this up and deliberately causing unemployment to get Government grants? Not even he could get up to argue that. It is not local councils that have caused this recession, yet still we hear from Government Members that councils are &#8220;reluctant&#8221; to promote economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.931.1/5">Coming from this Government that is a bit like King Herod accusing someone of child cruelty. Local authorities are still having to cope with the long-term legacy of heavy industry, followed by de-industrialisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.932.0/1">I am loth to interrupt my hon. Friend, who is making a powerful and passionate case that I have no doubt will sway even those stern Gradgrinds on the Government Benches. Does she accept that constituencies such as mine have islands of deprivation in a sea of affluence and that we have a post-industrial working class in parts of west London? Is it coincidence that the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea has the longest life expectancy of anywhere in the United Kingdom, whereas places such as her constituency and mine are at the other end, not through any fault, but because of industrial history? What can be done to address this cruelty?</p>

	<p pid="b.932.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. In the first place, we could ensure that we address those legacies of ill health and poverty, which create a greater demand for services and mean that fewer people are able to contribute to them. For example, why does Durham council need to spend more on older people than a similarly sized council such as Surrey? It is not because it is profligate, but because it has higher deprivation and ill health, which lead to greater demand for home care services but mean that fewer people are able to finance that care. Fifteen times as many people receive a community service in Durham as in Surrey and two and a half times more receive a home care service. That demonstrates the huge variation in need across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.932.1/2">Those levels do not bear any relation to an authority&#8217;s ability to generate income. In Surrey, for example, 75% of the properties are in band D or above. Surrey can generate more income from band D council tax than a similarly sized authority, which is a point that was made earlier. Unless those factors are taken into account in any financial settlement, there is a huge risk to services for those in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.932.1/3">A similar combination of need and a more difficult local economic situation can be seen in Halton, my neighbouring authority. One in five people in Halton has a limiting long-term illness, yet its ability to benefit from increased economic growth is more limited than that of other authorities for one simple reason: 22.3% of its business property already has an empty rating assessment, and even if it were all brought back into use it would generate little by way of extra income. The same is true of Liverpool and other big cities, where so much spare capacity exists that even if an extra 15,000 jobs were created, they would get no additional business rate income. When the Government insist that councils concentrate on increasing commercial floor space, the problem is that those who have surplus capacity find things increasingly difficult.</p>

	<p pid="b.932.2/1">The question of developing local economies also does not take into account the relationship between city regions. Often the drivers for economic growth might be outside a borough&#8217;s boundaries, or in a neighbouring local authority to which people will travel for work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.933.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" speakername="Helen Jones" colnum="933"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0003.htm#12052135001294">
	<p pid="b.933.0/1">My hon. Friend is quite right and that is true in many conurbations, such as Manchester and London, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.933.0/2">Let us also consider the need for children&#8217;s services. Levels of child poverty, and thus the demand for services, vary hugely between authorities. In Hartlepool, 29% of children are in poverty. In Newcastle, the figure is 27%, as it is in Liverpool. That is 91,000 children. I could not resist looking at that often mentioned authority, Wokingham, where the level of child poverty is 7%. Which area has the most need for services, yet which is benefiting most and is likely to benefit more from this Government&#8217;s plans?</p>
	<p pid="b.933.0/3">Such high levels of child poverty mean a higher demand for children&#8217;s services. In Liverpool, for example, 77% of the children in poverty are in single-parent families, meaning there is an even greater need for child care and support for families to help parents go to work, as well as for other support. Children in those areas need better service, not worse, and they need more help. There is no point in the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s banging on about the need to address inequalities in education unless the Government recognise that to make a real difference those inequalities must be tackled before children get to school.</p>
	<p pid="b.933.0/4">So, we have places such as Middlesbrough&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase> is shaking his head, but anyone in education knows that to make a real difference to educational attainment we need to tackle the inequalities before the children reach the age of five. By the time they get to school, those inequalities are entrenched and, if he does not think that that is true, I suggest he asks some teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.933.0/5">Middlesbrough is the ninth most deprived local authority in England and has seven times as many children receiving free school meals as Wokingham does. It clearly needs greater investment in children&#8217;s services. Poverty also drives the number of children being taken into care. We spoke earlier in the passage of the Bill about the huge increase in the number of referrals and children taken into care following the case of baby Peter, but the differences between authorities are stark. There was a 10% increase nationally in safeguarding referrals in the period around 2009-10, but in Liverpool the increase was 60%. Those are the differences that we are dealing with. The same applies to the numbers of looked-after children&#8212;children for whom the authority has a legal obligation to be the corporate parent and to provide. It cannot cut those services, it cannot trim them and it cannot decide how great the demand is.</p>

	<p pid="b.933.1/1">I ought to declare an interest, as my wife, Councillor Allison Gwynne, is the cabinet member for children&#8217;s services in Tameside council. My hon. Friend&#8217;s point about children&#8217;s services and the cost of those services is absolutely correct, not least because children&#8217;s services, particularly for looked-after children, is such a resource-intensive service and cannot easily be cut, nor should it be. It is those councils that often have the least ability to raise business rates that are likely to be penalised the most.</p>

	<p pid="b.933.2/1">I could not have put it better than did my hon. Friend. These services are demand-led; they are not within the control of the local authority, and they are, as he said, very expensive to provide, as they</p>
	<p pid="b.933.2/2">must be. We are dealing with some extremely damaged and vulnerable children in local authority care. Surrey has 32 looked-after children per 10,000 of population, and Wokingham has 22, compared with 104 per 10,000 in Middlesbrough and 100 per 10,000 in Newcastle. That is a stark example of the differing levels of need in local authorities, and the idea that those services should be left to the vagaries of the market is breathtaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.933.2/3">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne, who is no longer in his place, gave some good examples of how business rates can vary from year to year.

	<p pid="b.934.1/1">I do not think my hon. Friend is at all cynical. He is exactly right. The whole point of the Bill, as we have said throughout, is to centralise power and devolve the blame. We saw it earlier when we were debating council tax. We are seeing it now in the Government&#8217;s plans for business rates. I believe their aims are simple. They go about it in a complicated way, but the basic aim is very simple: to ensure that whoever gets the blame for cuts in local services, it is not them. It is also to ensure that the voices of those who are most in need are excluded from this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.1/2">We believe that the views of those people ought to be heard. Let us think about who they are. They are elderly men and women who have contributed all their lives and who are not getting the home care that they need in their old age, or are paying too much. It is a child in a family who may not be well-off but is dependent on local libraries for his or her education. It is the most vulnerable children in need of care and protection. These are the people to whom this Government pay no heed. We have moved the new clause because we do not intend their needs to be forgotten. I urge my hon. Friends to support it in the Lobby. It might help if I indicate that we will press it to a vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.934.2/1">Perhaps it is a sign of the complexity of the subject and the fact that we have not exactly taken the nation with us that there are so few Members in the Chamber tonight to discuss local government funding. We ought to remember that local government funding underpins local authority services, which support our most vulnerable people&#8212;the elderly and the disabled&#8212;and that it is women who are the heaviest users of local authority services and who are hardest hit when services are cut or funding is changed. Any changes to local authority funding need to be considered carefully and time must be taken to ensure that all intended and unintended consequences are known before those changes are made, not after, but adequate time and proper consideration are precisely what the Government&#8217;s proposals are lacking.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/2">We heard only this morning that nine of the 10 poorest areas in the country are in the north-west, and the 10th is in the north-east. We know that Government cuts to local authority funding have already led to every person in the average north-west local authority losing &#163;133. Every person in my local authority has lost &#163;70, yet every person in deepest deprived Surrey has gained &#163;2.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/3">Because of the complexities of local government funding, even slight changes in one area often have major impacts elsewhere. We are beginning to see clear evidence that the pupil premium, although well intended, is responsible for a shift in funding from the poorest areas to the most affluent, and from schools with high concentrations of children on free school meals to schools with lower concentrations of those children. The Government have already signalled their intention to shift health funding away from need and deprivation and towards the elderly population. That will have an impact on areas such as mine that have high concentrations of people who, because of our industrial heritage, are in need of health provision and live in deprivation, because the funding will be transferred to areas in the south where the more affluent and the elderly live.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/4">Now the Government propose changing business rates, which will simply carry on their work of siphoning funding from the poorest areas to the most affluent. Those policies on business rates are not new or untried; they were used in the USA in the 1990s and resulted in cities such as Detroit and New Orleans becoming derelict, because everyone who could move out did so and left the cities to the poorest and most vulnerable. The Government&#8217;s proposals on business rates take absolutely no account of the ability of individual local authorities to raise rates without the support of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/5">The Government&#8217;s proposals also take no account of geography. Any area that is not within the golden triangle of south-east England, northern France and Germany needs the support of Government infrastructure to attract businesses and business rates. We have heard tonight how, as a result of these proposals, the City of London will see cash growth of almost 140% over four years, yet places such as Liverpool, Knowsley, Bury, Wirral and south Tyneside will see cash growth over the same period of about 20%.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/6">The Government&#8217;s proposals take no account of the number of children living in poverty in a local authority or the number in need of local authority care and protection. They take no account of the number of elderly poor, the quality of housing or the number of people living in substandard housing or with chronic ill health. They do not take account of what local authorities need to spend; only of what they can raise.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/7">I am asking the Government to agree to carry out and publish an independent assessment of the needs of different local authorities before deciding how much of their business rate they can keep. Local authority funding formulae are complex and any review must be properly handled and carefully considered. I know that the Government do not do detail, but that is what local authority funding formulae are all about. If they get the detail wrong, they will cause chaos for our most vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/8">I remember that some years ago the previous Government were levering additional funding for schools, but the schools were saying that they were not getting it.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/9">Treasury civil servants initially pointed the finger at local authorities and said that they were creaming off the money. There was naming and shaming of local authorities, which came out very firmly and screamed that they were not creaming off the money. The civil servants looked again and then pointed the finger at special educational needs, saying that the growth in the SEN sector and its increasing cost was draining money that had been meant for the schools. A proper review found that it was not special educational needs, but a Treasury anorak&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.934.2/12" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="b.934.2/13">I am sorry, but Ministers should listen to this, because it is important. It was a Treasury anorak who tweaked the system in one area and caused a Mexican wave in another. Local authority funding is complex. If the Government do not take the time to consider it properly, the most vulnerable people in our society will be the most affected.</p>

I spent 16 years in a local authority and another eight on the Greater London authority dealing with funding issues, so I say to her gently, because I recognise the sincerity of her point, that the instance to which she refers occurred on the previous Government&#8217;s watch. Despite her indication that it was a risk in the system, it was a risk because of the opacity and complication of the funding system and the operation of the formula grant, which this Government inherited and are changing. I understand that there is a problem, but this Government are fixing it.</p>

	<p pid="b.936.4/1">Compared with formula grant that the Labour Government left behind, yes I do. That view was shared by the Lyons inquiry, which the previous Government very conveniently buried because it did not suit their purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/2">Might I now turn, Mr Deputy Speaker, specifically to the two sets of amendments and new clauses before us? I am sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase> is not in his place, because he made a thoughtful and well considered speech. I had the pleasure of shadowing him for a time and I respect his concern about the matter, so in fairness to his arguments, I will deal with the points he made.</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/3">New clause 1 relates to the operation of set-aside and the position of tax increment financing schemes&#8212;TIFs. The Government are committed to making TIFs option 2, which is what we are talking about, successful. I am glad to learn that when he was in government the right</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/4">hon. Gentleman was an advocate of TIFs. He was not, unfortunately, able to persuade those further up the governmental pay scale to introduce them, but I do not doubt that he tried hard. This Government are doing what everybody asked and succeeding in introducing them. He is quite right that for TIFs to operate properly there has to be a degree of certainty, but the change he proposes is not necessary because the provisions in the Bill already enable that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/5">The Government&#8217;s intention, as indicated in the White Paper, is that a ring fence exempts TIFs from the calculations of the levy, the set-aside and any reset, and the Bill already permits that. We also intend that, under the system, the additional uplift in rates retained be disregarded when setting tariffs and top-ups, not only in relation to the option 2 TIF scheme, but in respect of enterprise zones. That is why &#8220;proportion&#8221; is used in the regulations about which the right hon. Gentleman is concerned. The intention for TIFs is 100% ring-fencing, but in relation to enterprise zones, as hon. Members will know, the uplift in rates is retained from a starting point, so there is a proportion. The wording is used simply to cover both types of scheme and to enable both to be ring-fenced.</p>

	<p pid="b.937.0/1">Given the Minister&#8217;s response to the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, insisting that the new system is simpler, will he now explain how that mechanism, involving not only the set-aside and the levy but the reset and the differential arrangements in enterprise zones, will work in practice to achieve the objective, which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase> rightly stressed, of giving investors the certainty that there will be a ring fence?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-05-21b.937.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="937"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120521/debtext/120521-0003.htm#12052135001306">
	<p pid="b.937.1/1">I think that the right hon. Gentleman will have to make do with a potted version, given that I have only 10 minutes left and want to deal with other points as well. Suffice it to say that if he casts his eye over paragraph 37(1)(d)(iv) and (vi) of part 10 of new schedule 7B to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 &#8212;I know that he will want to do detail as we wish to do detail&#8212;he will see that the regulations permit those uplifts to be disregarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/2">Those provisions have the same effect as the new clause tabled by the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne would have. The Government have said that it is not our intention to reset the system until 2020, save in exceptional circumstances. I accept that for option 2 TIFs it may well be desirable to have a longer period than that, and the regulations will permit that. Enterprise zones and option 2 TIFs will be disregarded at the reset and could be disregarded for subsequent periods. It will therefore be convenient to align future resets with the revaluation period from 2015 onwards. The system will work perfectly well in practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/3">In amendments 62 and 63, the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne fairly recognises that central Government have, and always will have, an interest in public spending. It is unrealistic to think that central Government would not have a macro-economic view on the overall level of control over local government, and</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/4">that is why we could not accept his amendment and constrain ourselves in the way that is intended. However, we have always made it clear that, over time and particularly once we have the public finances back on track, we hope to increase the proportion of business rates that are part of the rates retention scheme. We are starting at 50%, which is a considerable step forward in giving local authorities greater financial autonomy, and the provisions in the Bill allow the figure to be increased if circumstances permit. Equally, however, one has to be realistic and recognise that in an economically difficult world it would be imprudent to presuppose that the central share could be removed altogether. I do not think that any Government would envisage that. It is conceivable that in dire circumstances the share could be increased, but that is certainly not the Government&#8217;s intention; we intend to reduce it as soon as economic circumstances permit. It is therefore appropriate to maintain the existing provisions, which enable the alterations in shares between local and central Government to be considered alongside the need to maintain affordability and to protect the interests of the taxpayer and the wider economy. Whatever the proportion, be it 50% or higher, I repeat the assurance that, as is consistent with the 1988 Act, it remains the case that business rates paid to central Government through the central share will be returned to local government through other grants.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/5">On amendment 63, we are alive to the point that the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne makes, and we will take it on board when drafting final regulations. We are conscious of the potential interaction of the incentive with loss of revenue at appeals, and we have said that we will consult further on that during the summer. We have already scheduled meetings between officials and local authority officials. Against that background, I hope that the he will feel able, albeit in absentia, to withdraw his amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/6">Let me turn to new clause 6 and the related proposals from Opposition Front Benchers. I could not help but note a slightly different tone in the debate when we discussed them. I think that earlier <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> alluded to one-tune records. With respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the hon. Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase>, a one-tune record is still a one-tune record however long you play it, and I am afraid that that is what we heard from the Opposition Front Bench. It is also, I am sorry to say, a rather inaccurate one-tune record, because when one analyses the hon. Lady&#8217;s argument, one sees that it is not only a serious indictment of the system that we inherited from the Labour Government but it does not accurately portray what we are seeking to do. It is a serious indictment of the Labour Government&#8217;s record because the list of undoubted differences and inequalities between regions in the UK that she set out is in some measure, if she will forgive my saying so, the legacy of the failed, highly centralist policies of the Labour Government. It is pretty scandalous that after 13 years of regional policy and of a highly centralised local government finance system, the inequalities to which she referred exist. That is what Labour left behind.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/7">The coalition has sought to address that legacy, even within the existing system. First, we have increased the weighting given to the needs element of the formula grant, which precisely reflects those issues, from 73% to</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/8">83%&#8212;something that no previous Government have done. Secondly, we have introduced transitional grant to deal with authorities in the greatest difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/9">It is worth bearing in mind that need is built into the calculations in the business rate retention system. Need is part of the calculation of the baseline because the needs element is part of the formula grant, and we have indicated that we will take the 2012-13 formula grant as the baseline. The hon. Lady&#8217;s examples of the undoubted cost pressures in social services, child care and so on are, therefore, reflected in the social services element of the formula grant that we have maintained, as well as in the uplift of the needs element that we have maintained. We have placed such authorities in a better position for the starting line.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/10">There are undoubtedly significant and sensitive services that are under pressure. Reference has been made to some of the child care cases that we know about. Those are really tough areas with real cost pressures, but under our system top-tier authorities in two-tier areas, which make up the majority of the authorities that are responsible for adult social care and children&#8217;s services, will be designated as top-up authorities. That means that they will be protected from volatility more than any other authorities in the system. They know that their top-up will be fixed for the reset period and index-linked thereafter to the retail prices index. There is particular protection in our system for authorities with the greatest need. The thrust of the Opposition proposals therefore falls at the first point.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/11">We have said that we will share the proceeds and the risks through the 50:50 split between local and central Government. We have said that the baseline will take into account the issues that we have taken on board. We have said that baseline funding will remain fixed and that growth in budgets will be linked to local business rates growth thereafter, but with protections in place. Opposition Front Benchers have shown a schizophrenic attitude to the Bill from start to finish. They have paid lip service to a degree of localism, and they have given examples of over-centralisation that, on analysis, turn out to be the legacy of their own system. They have been in denial throughout about the need to link reform of the local government system with a realistic appraisal of the need to reduce the deficit. They have produced a set of arguments about as dysfunctional as one could find, making them the Simpson family of British politics. We have heard no credible alternatives. They have played the same record time and time again, and they do not have much credibility. I hope that the House will resist the Opposition proposals if they are pressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.946.4/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is a bit like coming out in the play-off final after the brief half-time break at Wembley on Saturday. We just need a little bit more to close the deal as far as this Bill is concerned&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It did not have to go to penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/3">We have had a lengthy and sometimes constructive debate during the Bill&#8217;s progress through the House, and it is worth taking stock now. The House has the opportunity to make a considerable game shift in the relationship between central and local government. We are now in a position to move away from what has been, on any independent view&#8212;as consistently endorsed by independent experts, going back to Layfield, the Lyons inquiry and the resource review&#8212;the unhealthy level of dependence of local government on central Government for income that has accrued over the years. As part of the Government&#8217;s localism agenda, we intend to hand back power to local people and the authorities that represent them. I hope that that principle will be recognised by hon. Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/4">I shall set out what the Bill does and its wider context as part of the coalition&#8217;s localism agenda. It is recognised that giving greater local control over expenditure and revenue raising is desirable. The principle of business rates retention is therefore supported across the House. Once we drill under some of the rhetoric, there is also a general recognition that welfare spending needs to be brought under control, and that it is right that local authorities should have control over council tax support.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/5">The Bill incentivises local authorities to go for growth, because that is the other part of the agenda that the coalition regards as critical. We need to encourage sustainable growth and the Bill incentivises local authorities to grow their tax base by directly linking financial benefit to the decisions that they take on, for example, planning permissions that lead to more commercial floor space and economic activity, and in the design of their council tax support schemes that incentivise them to get claimants back into work, which is where we all want to see them wherever possible. It enables councils to decide how best to manage their contribution to reducing the deficit. All thoughtful commentators accept that a contribution must be made and that it is more likely to be nuanced and effectively delivered if there is local input into the design of that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/6">Local authorities will also be given the freedom to decide how to help provide for the most vulnerable in their communities. I hope that no one seriously thinks that any party has a monopoly on concern for vulnerable people in their communities. The Government regard the vulnerable as a top priority, and that is why we have increased the weighting given to the needs element of the formula grant in our financial settlements; why we have maintained that in the baseline; why we introduced transition grants; and why we will ensure that local authorities that deal with some of those areas of greatest cost pressure in relation to adult social care and children&#8217;s care will be designated as top-up authorities and will have a degree of certainty about their funding by index-linking and protection from volatility. That is a practical commitment to helping to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/7">The reforms are also part of our wider approach to supporting growth, which is our best hope of having the money that we need to support services for the vulnerable in a sustainable way; to get more people back into work; and to enable us to pay down the deficit, which at the moment ties the hands of central Government in seeking to deliver the services that we all want for our communities. We have made real progress on this front over the past two years. The Bill sets important incentives for business rate retention and helping people back into work through council tax support, but that is linked to other parts of the agenda. We are encouraging local authorities to build new homes, through the new homes bonus, an incentive for both commercial activity and domestic building. Homes as well as jobs are central to the incentives we are putting in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/8">The local enterprise partnerships are bringing together businesses and civic leaders to provide strong local leadership and to drive growth. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I and all the Ministers involved in the legislation very much hope that the Bill will not only make technical changes but bring about an attitude change in the relationship between local government and their business communities. Many of our competitors have a much closer relationship between their local authorities and the big economic drivers, but that has not always been incentivised in the UK. The Bill will enable it to happen and&#8212;I hope&#8212;help that mindset to develop. The LEPs will play a part in that by setting up the structure to enable it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/9">We have put in place 24 enterprise zones offering discounted business rates and simplified planning to attract new local business and investment. The regional</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/10">growth fund, the Growing Places fund and the Get Britain Building fund are providing a &#163;3.3 billion boost to local economies and supporting tens of thousands of jobs, and through our welfare reforms we are seeking to bring welfare spending back under control and to target support. The 2010 spending review focused on reducing welfare costs through savings of about &#163;7 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/11">Localising council tax support will help to deliver savings of &#163;500 million across Great Britain&#8212;this in an area of activity where expenditure more than doubled under the Labour Government. It is not a sign of a healthy economy that expenditure on council tax benefit should have doubled between 1997 and 2009-10. Instead, we are providing strong incentives for local authorities to support growth and improve employment opportunities, helping to reduce poverty and reliance on support, as well as hold down costs in the long term. Speaking as someone whose grandfather clawed his way out of poverty in the east end, I, like plenty of other Government Members, have as much personal experience of such things as anyone else who has spoken.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/12">The Bill has received extensive scrutiny. Its core principles were set out in the coalition agenda; we then proceeded with the local government resource review in early 2011; there was a consultation, along with eight detailed, technical papers to explain the thinking behind the reforms; and we have discussed the detail of the scheme through our local government finance working group and several sub-working groups. We have by no means ignored the views of local authorities; on the contrary, we have sought to engage with them, and will continue to do so, at every stage in the process. Those groups have been meeting frequently since January.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/13">Localising council tax is a pragmatic approach to balancing the need for reform with ensuring a sensible level of deficit reduction, and builds on the welfare reform White Paper, published in autumn 2010, setting out our broad intentions. We undertook pre-consultation engagement with local authorities and other groups to help them to understand the issues, and held delivery partner engagement events last August and September, as well as a full three-month consultation from August to October that generated about 400 responses.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/14">Against that background of consultation, nobody can say that the Government have not sought to engage with people over our reforms. Against that background of consultation and information sharing, last Thursday we published a series of statements of intent to provide clarity and assurance to the House and councils about how the reforms, including our proposal to fund localised support for council tax, will work in practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/15">I shall tell the House what we have published so far and how much we have sought to set out the agenda. We have announced that business rates will be split 50:50 between central and local government and confirmed that central Government will return their share of business rates, in its entirety, to local government, and we have confirmed that the system will not be reset until 2020 at the earliest to give sufficient reward and long-term certainty while ensuring that the scheme will be fiscally sustainable, thus protecting the interests of taxpayers and the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/16">Our economic analysis, which has been independently verified, suggests that a 50% local share over a seven-year reset could create an additional &#163;10 billion of gross domestic product. That figure is based on the multiplication</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/17">of additional commercial floor space created through our incentive effect and, then, the additional gross GDP that stems from the economic activity in that commercial floor space.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/18">We have set out the statements of intent indicating what will be in the secondary legislation, including&#8212;as was noted in the previous debate&#8212;the safety net threshold, to be set at between 7.5% and 10%, to protect against volatility.</p>
	<p pid="b.946.4/19">On the localisation of council tax support, we have been clear that we will seek to provide as much detail as possible as early as possible. We continue to work with local authorities and service providers on the design of the scheme. <i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i> I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> does not believe that any proposal that he did not make could be taken seriously, but that perhaps says rather more about him than about the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.949.0/1">Perhaps the Minister will now tell the House how he believes that publishing everything that is required to enable early implementation as soon as possible is compatible or consistent with the current situation, where, eight months before local authorities have to finalise the scheme, they do not yet know what the legal requirements are.</p>

	<p pid="b.949.1/1">If the right hon. Gentleman deigns to read the statements of intent, he will find what is effectively an executive summary of the regulations, which will deal with how the default scheme operates, including for pensioners, who we have indicated should be protected. We are having regular meetings with our local government working group, which includes representatives of local authority treasurers, and we are also in regular contact with the principal software provider and other service providers. We are therefore doing exactly what the right hon. Gentleman would want us to do, although I doubt whether it will satisfy him, because it is not him doing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/2">We have announced &#163;30 million of initial funding to help meet the costs of planning and analysing draft schemes for both billing and precepting authorities, so we are supporting local authorities.

	<p pid="b.949.3/1">I notice that the hon. Lady is in what some might uncharitably term &#8220;sneering mode&#8221; this evening. I think that says something about the attitude of Labour Members towards a reform that they know needs to be undertaken, but which they never had the courage to undertake, which rather undermines their argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.3/2">We have also taken steps in the Bill to make things easier for local authorities&#8212;for example, by clarifying that billing authorities can consult with precepting authorities, produce a draft scheme and consult more widely, all before the Bill receives Royal Assent. It is a fair point to say that the time frame is challenging, but doing those sensible things in parallel makes the scheme</p>
	<p pid="b.949.3/3">perfectly capable of being delivered. That is an important practical step that we have taken. We are determined to put local authorities into the best possible position to develop and consult on their local schemes. I stress that local authorities have real choices about how they develop their schemes for working-age council tax payers, what protection they choose to offer and how they choose to fund that protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.3/4">The reality is that, under the circumstances, &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; will not work. Different areas face different challenges, and they have to make different choices. That is localism. I hope the Opposition will reflect on the fact that if they talk about being in favour of localism, it ill behoves them to seek to obstruct a Bill that, together with the Localism Act 2011, presents local authorities with the most significant practical step towards localism that we have seen in many a long day. I hope that, rather than repeating the mantra that we have heard so far&#8212;a mantra on, frankly, rather narrow ideological grounds&#8212;the Opposition will use their influence with their representatives in local government to step up to the plate, help to design the schemes that we all need to have in place and drive forward what is a real opportunity for local government in the years ahead. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.950.0/1">I know that the Minister is an enthusiast, but those watching could be forgiven for thinking that the Bill was the answer to all the nation&#8217;s ills&#8212;at one count it was, with one thing and another, solving poverty and dealing with the deficit. Also, although I have a high regard for the Secretary of State, I am surprised that he did not make that speech, because after all, this is his flagship Bill. I know that we have a part-time Chancellor; I just hope that it is not proving contagious in the Cabinet. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I say that genuinely, as it would have been nice to hear from the Secretary of State, who has spoken only once on the Bill&#8212;on Second Reading. The House will recall that he claimed great things for the Bill, no doubt because the coalition agreement promised</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/2">&#8220;a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/3">The truth is, however, that as the Bill has progressed, it has failed to live up to that promise. I shall respond directly to the Minister&#8217;s point here.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/4">As we were reminded earlier today, it pays to try to get these things right. I say that because, with one exception, those sitting on the Government Front Bench have form. People remember that the last time wonderful words were said about a reform of local government finance, it was called the poll tax and the consequences included riots on the streets. The people would not have it and the Prime Minister lost her job. The Secretary of State argued that the current system gives central Government too much power and that he wanted to change that. We would take him at face value if that is what the Bill did, but it does not.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/5">What the Bill does and what the Secretary of State has created is a system that gives all the power to himself&#8212;the power to determine the central top-slice; the power to set the baseline; and the power to decide the extent of the tariff for the top-up and when the safety-net should kick in. It is a whole list of powers. If</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/6">this really is localism&#8212;the argument that the Minister tried to advance&#8212;why are there all these central powers? It does not sound much like localisation to me, and it does not feel much like that to local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/7">That matters because when local authorities look at the way in which this Government have chosen to exercise the powers they already have, particularly in relation to spending, they have found, as we know, a pattern of cuts that is utterly unfair and the very opposite of &#8220;We are all in this together&#8221;. It also matters because, as the Minister will know, although he did not refer to it, one of the real concerns about the Bill that we have heard from colleagues in local government is that it will end up accentuating the gap between more prosperous and less well-off local authorities. That is a real concern. The Government&#8217;s only reply has been to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, because at least you will not be worse off in year one.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/8">That is why the arrangements surrounding the safety net are so important. As the House knows, some authorities are very heavily dependent on the business rate income they get from a particular factory or a big employer. At the moment, it does not matter because it all goes into the central pot and is then divided and comes back, but under this Bill, it really will matter, and the consequences of losing that income&#8212;if the business were to close or relocate elsewhere, for instance&#8212;would be devastating. In those circumstances, what those local authorities want to know is whether the Government will be there to help. What we find when we look at the papers published last Thursday is that the safety net will kick in only when authorities meet a threshold for the decline in their business rate income, and we are advised that the threshold will be set between 7.5% and 10%. That is hardly reassuring, because it means that local authorities could lose a lot of money under this Bill before help arrives. To put it another way, councils are going to have to fall quite a long way before they hit the net.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/9">The Bill was also supposed to be about trying to get rid of a complex system for funding local government&#8212;we heard the argument a few moments ago. Frankly, however, all the Bill does is to replace one version of complexity with, in the words of London Councils, another &#8220;fiendishly complex system&#8221;. If anything, on the basis of the documents produced last week, the Bill has grown even more complex during its passage through the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/10">As for enabling local authorities to receive the benefits of business rate income and its growth, what do we discover? We discover that the Government like the idea of business rate income growth so much that they are going to take half of it for themselves. That is what was announced last week. It is no wonder that the Local Government Association has described this as a &#8220;tax on local authorities&#8221;, which it strongly opposes. What is more, the Government seem to intend that set-aside will continue beyond 2015. Why? Because they want to be able to continue to impose cuts on local government after the end of the current spending review period. Having heard the Minister&#8217;s argument that this was the be-all and end-all of localism, the Local Government Association said that it was</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/11">&#8220;not a localising policy and goes against the Government's stated commitment to localism.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/12">That deals with the first part of the Bill. What about council tax benefit? Rank inconsistency is plain for all to see. Only a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State was</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/13">touring the country denouncing those who were planning a modest increase in council tax, including a number of Tory-controlled authorities. He said that he was</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/14">&#8220;determined to protect hard-working families&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/15">but here we have a Bill that will end up doing exactly what he was denouncing. We have legislation that will, from next year, impose council tax increases on many unsuspecting people. And whom has the Secretary of State chosen as his target for those higher council tax bills? In keeping with the Government&#8217;s philosophy, he has chosen people on low incomes&#8212;people who do not have a lot of money&#8212;because that is why they get council tax benefit in the first place; and on that, he is strangely silent.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/16">As if to flaunt just how out of touch they are, the Government had the nerve to say, in one of the documents published last week, that the aims of the council tax benefit cut included &#8220;reducing poverty&#8221;. This is a strange way of going about it. The Government are saying to people with not a lot of money, &#8220;You know what? We are going to cut your income to make you work harder&#8221;, which is the precise opposite of the policy that they have pursued when it comes to millionaires and the tax cut that was announced in the Budget. They also claim that they do not want to affect work incentives, but, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> pointed out, that is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/17">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> for the forensic analysis to which she has subjected the Bill during its passage through this House. I am sure that her cogent arguments will be considered very carefully by those in the other place. I also pay tribute to other colleagues, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich&#8212;who chairs the Select Committee&#8212;and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/18">I am genuinely surprised that so few coalition Back Benchers have twigged what is going on in the Bill in relation to council tax. They do not seem to know what they are about to troop through the Lobbies to vote for. As we pointed out on Second Reading, and as has been said today, cutting council tax benefit by 10% while&#8212;rightly&#8212;protecting pensioners means an average 16% cut for everyone else, but the impact will not be felt evenly.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/19">In one of the other documents that were published last week, the Government said, &#8220;We considered whether we should even things out to take account of the different proportions of pensioners in different local authority areas, but we rejected the idea.&#8221; As I have said, the impact will not be felt evenly, because some areas contain much higher percentages of pensioners than others. The list is like a roll call of seats represented by Government Members, but it seems that Government Members&#8212;with, I think, only two honourable exceptions during Second Reading and Committee&#8212;are either completely unaware that their constituents who are currently receiving council tax benefit will face higher council tax bills than elsewhere, because their areas contain a higher proportion of protected pensioners than others, or are not too bothered about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/20">Let me say this, very gently, to Back-Bench members of the coalition parties. When their constituents turn up at their surgeries in a year&#8217;s time, waving a bit of paper and saying, &#8220;Why have you done this to me?&#8221;, they will be very, very bothered about what the Bill actually does. Indeed, all our constituents are likely to face additional</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/21">cuts, because the forecast baseline for council tax benefit expenditure that is being used for the Bill is expected, miraculously&#8212;from my point of view and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington North&#8212;to fall. Do Members really believe that demand for council tax benefit will decline in the next two years, in the light of the current state of the economy and the fact that we are now back in recession thanks to the Chancellor&#8217;s economic policy?</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/22">When we come to the default scheme to be applied if local authorities do not come up with their own scheme, what do we find? We find that the Government&#8217;s courage fails completely in following through the 10% reduction, because the default scheme in effect replicates the current scheme. Instead of Ministers having the courage of their convictions and applying the 10% cut across the board, they have ducked that, and are expecting everyone else to show the courage they themselves have refused to demonstrate.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.0/23">In conclusion, whichever way we look at it, this part of the Bill is unfair and wrong, and no amount of trying to describe it as something else is going to alter what the changes in council tax benefit will do to our constituents on low incomes who need that support. We urge other Members to join us and vote against the Bill on Third Reading because it fails to meet the test on business rates that the Secretary of State set out when moving it on Second Reading and, as we have discovered in our discussions, it is even harsher in respect of cutting council tax benefit than appeared to be the case at first sight. In both those respects, the Bill reminds us of what this coalition Government are all about: they are unfair, out of touch and do not work&#8212;and nor, I fear, will the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.953.0/1">The Government are having great difficulty in convincing anyone that the Bill does what they claim. They claim it is a localising measure, but, as we have heard, there is an extraordinary lack of support for it on their own Back Benches. Indeed, so far not a single one of their Back Benchers has spoken in support of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/2">Local authorities are the supposed beneficiaries, but they, too, are profoundly unconvinced. Let us listen to what they say. London Councils says:</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/3">&#8220;London Councils supports the principle of business rate retention, but has grave concerns about the proposed changes set out in the Bill regarding the way in which the system will function.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/4">It adds:</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/5">&#8220;London Councils is strongly opposed to the introduction of local council tax reduction schemes, as set out in Clause 8 and Schedule 4 of the Bill.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/6">The Local Government Association says:</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/7">&#8220;In principle we support the localisation of National Non-Domestic Rates&#8230;The principle of full business rate localisation, which also ensures fair treatment of councils in areas with weak economies, would be a powerful move towards localism&#8230;However, the government proposes to keep a top slice amounting to 50 per cent of business rates for the Treasury, taking taxes paid by local businesses for local services and using them for local services based on national priorities instead. That is not a localising policy and goes against the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to localism.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/8">If the Government cannot convince the people who are supposedly the beneficiaries of their reforms that they are acting in their favour, I am afraid they are in serious difficulty. The Government are, indeed, clearly in deep difficulty in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.953.0/9">Incidentally, in the earlier debate I sought to intervene on one of the Ministers, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>, as he had inaccurately claimed that the previous Government had done nothing to allow greater local discretion over discounts on second homes. I hope he will use this opportunity to put the record straight, because, as he will know, that is simply not correct. I am sure it was an unintentional error, however. The previous Government legislated to give local councils discretion to reduce the discount on second homes from 50% to just 10%. The Minister may wish to argue about the 10% figure, but there was good reason for deciding on it, and that was a clear extension of discretion to local government. It is therefore simply wrong to suggest that we did nothing in that regard. I hope the record will be put straight.</p>

	<p pid="b.954.1/1">I am very grateful indeed to the Minister for that gracious apology.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/2">The first part of this Bill is a wasted opportunity, as it fails to deliver what people want in terms of a truly localist objective. The second part, which deals with the council tax benefit changes, is deeply flawed. The changes are damaging and will either cause serious hardship to recipients of council tax benefit or will put pressure on local authority budgets. It is not just the initial &#163;500 million that will be a problem; increased costs may come later on as a result of further claims for council tax benefit, which may result from closures of local businesses or a further period of recession. That will be an extra risk for local government, which will get no support for central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/3">Finally, on the issue of administration, the Government are acting recklessly by rushing ahead without giving adequate time for proper preparation. It has been said repeatedly by those in the know, be they people in local authorities or their IT advisers, that the timetable is too tight to allow proper implementation. I will not go through the details, as we did so in the earlier debate, but it is reckless of the Government to ignore that and to claim that local authorities and others are happy with the timetable that the Government have set&#8212;they are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/4">I shall end by quoting what local government has said on this. The LGA says:</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/5">&#8220;The tight timeframe for implementing this places an even greater burden on councils and we urge the Government to give councils the necessary time to do this&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/6">London Councils says that</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/7">&#8220;even under best-case scenario planning, the proposed implementation timetable may well be unachievable if council tax bills are to be sent out on time&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/8">That is not the action of a prudent Government; it is reckless and, I am afraid, it is typical of this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.959.2/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this Adjournment debate, which I very much appreciate. I wish to speak about the impact of the Budget and the Government&#8217;s policies on Coventry, and I might touch on issues that affect the west midlands. My purpose in doing so is twofold.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/2">First, many issues arising from the Budget will have a significant impact on the people of Coventry and should be debated properly. My constituents&#8217; serious concerns regarding the effect of Government policies deserve to be raised. It is easy to discuss Budget policies in abstract terms, but we would do well to take the time to consider what they will mean for the regions and for people.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/3">Secondly, there is a distinct pattern to the Government&#8217;s policies and rhetoric: they are far too London-centric, as some people would say. Therefore, it is vital that we hold debates that focus on the regions and cities across this country in order to draw attention to their concerns, which the Government frequently ignore. I am sure that much of what will be discussed tonight applies to other regions and cities hit by the Budget. The Government show not nearly enough understanding of regional issues or appreciation of just how much places such as Coventry are hit by their policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/4">With that in mind, I want to outline why the Government&#8217;s optimism is misplaced, certainly as far as Coventry is concerned. We must not underplay the high level of unemployment currently being suffered. On Wednesday the Prime Minister assured us that overall unemployment was down and that the number of claimants of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance had decreased. Figures from the Office for National Statistics, which were published last week, reveal that there are 10,321 unemployed jobseekers in Coventry&#8212;three fewer than were counted in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/5">The Prime Minister&#8217;s complacency about the employment crisis shows an unrealistic approach to the stagnation we are witnessing in Coventry, where 4.9% of 16 to 24-year-olds are out of work. That is similar to the figure for the west midlands overall but significantly higher than that for Great Britain, which is 4%. That is particularly clear when we look at the percentage of male jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants. Nationally, the figure is 5.3%, which is already shockingly high, but Coventry is suffering from having 6.7% of the male population claiming jobseeker&#8217;s allowance. It is clear that the slight improvements the Government are celebrating simply do not apply to Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/6">Against the background of high unemployment, I wish to highlight the crucial role of the public sector in the growth of Coventry&#8217;s economy. Since the millennium, Coventry has benefited from significant redevelopment and regeneration, and the public sector has been crucial in that process. The concern now is that the Government&#8217;s public sector cuts will return Coventry to the hard times of the late &#8217;70s, and certainly the &#8217;80s, that many of us remember. It was a ruinous time in Coventry&#8217;s history and led to a whole generation struggling to reach their potential for decades after.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/7">Every public sector employee who loses their job through the Government&#8217;s public policy cuts is simply one more person without an income to spend on the local economy&#8212;one more person who will stop spending on businesses that in places such as Coventry are essential for stimulating growth in the local and national economies. Our public sector workers are a crucial part of our society and economy, and they do essential work for communities. It is ludicrous and poorly substantiated to claim that their work can be swiftly replaced by the private sector. There is certainly little evidence of that in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/8">The Government have said that they intend to rebalance the economy, and they aim to do so by cutting the public sector and replacing it with the private sector. They have certainly achieved the former, but there is little evidence visible in Coventry of the necessary investment in the private sector. The Chancellor needs a clear and vigorous industrial strategy to encourage the private sector growth that he hopes will replace the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/9">That should be combined with a full jobs strategy, working on aligning the money going into the city with the people out of work, and targeting it at getting people back into work. That is particularly true of Coventry&#8217;s young people. Coventry saw an 87% increase in long-term youth unemployment last year, but there was nothing in the Budget to encourage any hope that this would be reversed.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/10">The Chancellor promised that the Budget would deliver a great deal for businesses such as those in Coventry, but the Coventry and Warwickshire chamber of commerce was greatly disappointed. The chamber&#8217;s chief executive, noting that the Budget&#8217;s rhetoric on the promise for business was not matched by any content, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/11">&#8220;If we&#8217;re honest, it was quite London-centric in many regards and that obviously wasn&#8217;t particularly welcomed. There were lots of small announcements that picked away around the edges but many of the things that weren&#8217;t mentioned caused most angst, such as empty property rate relief and the fact that business rates are going up.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/12">People throughout the country were hopeful about the prospect of a Budget that would offer real support to local businesses to allow them to grow, but they were generally disappointed by the reality, which gave little practical encouragement to allow Coventry businesses to expand, and that is likely to get a lot worse as the year progresses.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/13">Coventry is famous for car making, but public sector workers drive much of the local economy. As we know, Becta and the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency are being abolished. It might seem an easy option to get rid of those education quangos, which employ a combined total of almost 800 people, many of whom are former teachers, but the relocation of the QCDA cost the Government more than &#163;44million and came at a personal cost to many staff who relocated from London.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/14">We cannot, furthermore, ignore the strain that these cuts put on the private sector. Friends Life, previously Friends Provident, announced that it plans to close its offices in Coventry by the end of the first half of 2012, and 428 staff are employed there. Owing to those cuts, Coventry city council will be forced by the Tory-led Government to cut more than 500 posts, possibly, over the next 18 months. The amount that the council spends in the local economy will also be reduced dramatically, and that will impact on council staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/15">The front-loading of cuts means that staff losses will be required at an early stage of the spending cuts, and that will affect families throughout Coventry. This is the overall impact: Coventry city council is expected to lose about &#163;45 million over the next two or three years; and all of that will have a significant knock-on impact on local businesses and employment in the region</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/16">We can see what is happening in other sectors as the cuts and reforms begin to bite. For example, there are cuts of more than 20% in West Midlands police, equating to 2,500 jobs, and there are two parts to the Department for Communities and Local Government&#8217;s cuts for Coventry city council: formula grant, losing over &#163;19 million; and specific grants, losing over &#163;17 million. The council will not be able to continue to provide services at the same level. There will be far fewer grants, with a lower overall value, and the great concern is that many grant streams will end.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/17">In the light of these destructive cuts, many people are extremely concerned about the proposed cuts to regional pay in the public sector. I cannot condemn this policy strongly enough. We in Coventry accept that living costs are far higher in London than they are in Coventry, but that is the reason for the London allowance and London stipend made available to many employees working in London. This is far removed from the idea that public sector workers should earn less for the same work because they live in places such as Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/18">The Treasury says that public sector pay is 18% higher than in the private sector in some parts of the UK, but that argument demonstrates a flawed approach by which the Office of National Statistics continues to compare private and public sector workers on a like-for-like basis. They are not directly comparable, and it is wilfully blind and evasive to pretend that they are. Two thirds of public sector workers are women, compared with about 40% of those in the private sector. Public sector workers tend to be older and more highly qualified. Professions such as nursing and teaching entail workers remaining in their profession for a long time, building up skills and salaries. None of those are characteristics that the public sector should be ashamed of. The private sector, by comparison, includes workers at the other end of the economy such as those in retail, catering and leisure. Industries in the private sector often pay their workers very low wages, and that skews any fair comparison of the sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/19">The public sector makes up roughly 20% of the work force, while the financial sector makes up 20% of the economy. More meaningfully, public sector wages are far from high by comparison with those in the private sector. I have always believed in lifting people up rather than lowering them down. Public sector workers are already being hit very hard with frozen salaries, higher pension contributions, and higher living costs. We cannot overestimate the negative impact on Coventry&#8217;s economy that would result from local public sector workers earning lower salaries. That would take money out of the regional economy, and the stunting effect on growth would outweigh any benefits to the Treasury. I therefore call strongly on the Government to allay the fears of those in Coventry who are worried about the prospect of regional pay cuts.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/20">Against those fears for the regional economy, let me touch on the impact of the Government&#8217;s policies on the vulnerable people of Coventry, who will be hit from</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/21">many directions by their deficit reduction plan. Pensioners have been dealt a blow by the Government as the winter fuel payment has been slashed by up to &#163;100. According to the BBC, family fuel costs have risen by about &#163;1,250 over the past two years, and mortgage interest rates are starting to creep up, which will affect many families. Disabled and ill people are suffering from the removal of the mobility component of the disability living allowance. Coventry&#8217;s poorest residents are being undermined in the justice system by the removal of face-to-face legal advice in favour of a cheaper phone line. These are but a few of the policies that are having a huge negative impact on vulnerable individuals, who are now having opportunities to turn to public services taken away.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/22">I am deeply concerned about the local provisions for our young people. In June, &#163;335 million was taken from the council through the abolition of Building Schools for the Future, which has yet to be replaced despite many promises about announcements. The Government cannot simply remove this vital investment from Coventry without even suggesting an alternative, let alone funding one. The Budget bore no reference to allocations of funding for school buildings. Aside from the obvious implications for Coventry schools, the Government are missing a great opportunity to stimulate the construction industry. I understand that the Government&#8217;s private building scheme is expected to rebuild between 100 and 300 schools nationally, but they have been dragging their feet on this issue for 20 months. Coventry city council has made it clear that some schools are in dire straits and urgently in need of investment. Without details of the Government&#8217;s plans, the council is unable to make its own plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/23">As of April, the Connexions careers service has been operating on a budget more than 70% smaller than in April 2010. That service gives young people the skills and confidence they need to get in to the workplace, and its downsizing will no doubt contribute to the high youth unemployment that we experience as a city and as a region.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/24">The children, learning and young people&#8217;s directorate has announced the loss of a further &#163;1.2 million as a result of the 5% cut to the standards fund. The council had been relying on those crucial retention funds, but they will not be transferred to the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/25">On that note, the Friargate development, which will revitalise and transform Coventry city centre, was going ahead on the expectation that Coventry would be one of the eight core cities to benefit from the tax incremental financing scheme. The Deputy Prime Minister told the local authority in 2010 that Coventry would be a recipient of that scheme. Not only is Coventry excluded, but the pot of money has been reduced to &#163;150 million. The council was relying on that money, which was to be paid back on a tax basis, to allow the development to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/26">The abolition of the funding from regional development agencies means that there is little funding to lever in private sector investment for large-scale redevelopment projects. Some colleagues will remember that Coventry and Warwickshire were led to believe that they would get an enterprise zone. Once again, they lost out. I therefore call on the Minister to reconsider the use of tax incremental financing to allow the city to grow. I understand that the council is also looking to take part in the city deals initiative. The city&#8217;s project is urgently in need of that money.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.2/27">All of that will have an irreversible effect on the economic growth of the region and of Coventry. The leader of Coventry city council estimates that up to &#163;25 million will be taken out of the local economy. The public and private sectors will not be able to invest in regeneration and infrastructure in the region. With the loss of the &#163;355 million schools programme and the missed opportunity for the building industry, it is clear that the Government are wilfully blind to the devastating effect of their policies in Coventry. In addition, Coventry university hospital has to find an additional &#163;28 million over the next year or two. The Government need to stop thinking only of London and think more about the other regions and cities that make up this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.963.0/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40187" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham)</phrase> on securing it. There may not be many of us here this evening, but you are still in the Chair, Mr Speaker, and we will be able to speak directly, without a lot of interruptions, beyond this Chamber to the people of Coventry about the list of indictments, which my hon. Friend stated so powerfully, of the effects that the Government&#8217;s policies will have on our city, whether or not that is their intention.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/2">My hon. Friend gave a long list of problems that the Government&#8217;s policies are creating for Coventry. I will start with Friargate. The inner city of Coventry is pretty well known. During the war, it was the most bombed city in the country, starting with the November raids right back in 1941. Afterwards, everybody thought that they owed a particular debt to Coventry, which was wonderful&#8212;I was not there at that time, of course&#8212;and the cathedral and the city centre were rebuilt. City planning was such at that time that good money, planning and thinking were put into it. A ring road was put around the city, and to this day traffic flows around Coventry and in and out of it marvellously well.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/3">The trouble is that the city centre has become derelict. People do not eat there socially, congregate there or spend time there. It is desolate, which leads to all those activities that we do not want to see in any of our city centres. We need a revision of the original city planning more than 50 years ago, which is long enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/4">Early on, the Government thought of an imaginative and good scheme called the tax incremental financing scheme, which was to be partly funded by incremental taxes from the locality, region or city, but would have Government encouragement and power behind it. No less a person than the Deputy Prime Minister promised that we would be beneficiaries of it. Sadly, however, we are used to his broken promises,. I say this as an admirer of his, but he has made and broken many promises, including on tuition fees. Despite being given a specific promise that we would be included in the eight cities that could contribute to their own rehabilitation, which we desperately needed, we have not been.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/5">I understand that all is not lost. A new initiative&#8212;an initiative rather than a scheme this time&#8212;has been put forward in which Coventry has been invited to take part, and our council has responded positively. I hope that Coventry can usefully and profitably participate in the city deal initiative. I regret to say that the city centre is a blot on the copybook of our huge post-war efforts</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/6">to rebuild the country and its cities. We did not succeed with it, and we need to do so in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/7">Another area of great disappointment has been Coventry&#8217;s schools. The cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme has been a great setback. We were on the point of signing contracts, but as a responsible council, Coventry held back, and the Government applauded it for doing so. We urged it to sign the damn things and get the contracts signed, but no, it held back.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/8">Two schools in my constituency were affected. One, Woodlands, is an exemplary comprehensive built after the, war with the usual &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s concrete construction. The other, President Kennedy school&#8212;the name tells the date&#8212;was constructed on similar principles. Those schools are now in urgent need of replacement, but because the council did not want to behave even slightly irresponsibly and would not sign the contracts, we lost out by a total of &#163;335 million, as my hon. Friend mentioned. I visit those two schools regularly and work with them. The attitude of the Secretary of State for Education towards them is very off-hand. It is not that I mind personally, because it does not hurt me, but he seems to ignore the fact that those schools had a good and reasonable case for making a demand on the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/9">The Secretary of State wrote in similar terms to Becta and to the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency. In fairness, the Conservatives said before the election that they would get rid of the QCDA&#8212;typically, they said that without hearing the case, but at least they had said that that was what they were going to do. The letter to the QCDA was, if I may say so, peremptory and impolite; it was unworthy of him, but at least they had said what they would do. Becta, though, was suddenly closed without anybody knowing anything about it. It seemed as though Coventry was being targeted again&#8212;I do not intend to make the obvious military historical reference here&#8212;as the centre that had to be hit.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry South mentioned what the chief executive of the Coventry and Warwickshire chamber of commerce had said. I promise that she is no supporter of mine or of the Labour party. I am pleased to see the Economic Secretary on the Treasury Bench, because I would like her to listen to what the chief executive said. The best that she could find to say was, &#8220;If we&#8217;re honest&#8221;&#8212;that is very difficult for Governments to do, as I appreciate&#8212;the Budget</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/11">&#8220;was quite London-centric in many regards and that obviously wasn&#8217;t particularly welcomed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/12">That is the final judgment of a chamber of commerce chief executive, a representative of the very people the whole Budget was meant to be about supporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.963.0/13">I put it to the Economic Secretary, who is to respond to the debate, that we desperately need help. We do not want handouts, we want help up. That is what we are after. If only she would meet us halfway, we could still do great things in Coventry, but we need a Government who are capable of responding to the need that exists.</p>

	<p pid="b.964.0/1">I shall do my best in the six minutes remaining to cover a selection of the points raised by the hon. Members for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham) and</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/2">for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson). I thank both for the passion with which they have spoken about their city in this interesting debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/3">The Government made clear in Budget 2012 that our priorities are threefold: to create a stable economy; to create a fairer, more efficient and simpler tax system; and to introduce reforms to support growth. The Budget and the national infrastructure plan published the preceding autumn set out the Government&#8217;s latest steps towards achieving those priorities, based on a new model of sustainable and balanced growth, including in Coventry and more widely.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/4">As the hon. Gentlemen made clear, the west midlands is not without its challenges, but the region remains a significant contributor to the national economy. The reforms set out in the Budget will give businesses and individuals in the region a further boost by cutting corporation tax by an additional 1% on top of the rate cuts announced last year. From April this year, the rate will be reduced from 26% to 24%&#8212;it will eventually fall to 22% in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/5">The reforms also provide a boost by increasing the personal allowance by &#163;1,100, taking 75,000 people in the west midlands out of tax altogether, and by increasing the Growing Places fund to provide additional funding for the infrastructure needed to unlock developments that will lead to jobs and growth. Local enterprise partnerships in Coventry and Warwickshire will receive a further &#163;4.1 million. We confirm that Birmingham has been selected to become a super-connected city, and we are investing almost &#163;60 million in stalled development projects within the west midlands. Furthermore, we will support individuals and families to buy new build property with just a 5% deposit through the NewBuy scheme, and increase the maximum right-to-buy discount to &#163;75,000, which is &#163;49,000 more than the current west midlands limit of &#163;26,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/6">The hon. Member for Coventry South spoke of youth unemployment, which I agree is a vital issue for our country. He will be aware of the answer given to him by the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-13">13 December 2011</phrase>. He directed the hon. Gentleman</p>

	<p pid="b.964.0/10">That scheme is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.0/11">The challenge laid down by the hon. Gentlemen, which the Government have taken up, was to return the UK economy to sustainable economic growth that is more balanced across the country. We have established local enterprise partnerships and enterprise zones.</p>

	<p pid="b.966.2/1">The Minister mentioned the west midlands, but could she not say something about Coventry? She even mentioned Birmingham. I made some unfortunate remarks about Birmingham not so long ago&#8212;I will not repeat them&#8212;but we are talking about Coventry tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.966.3/1">The hon. Gentleman pre-empts my next paragraph. I should like to draw his attention to the successful bids in the Coventry and Warwickshire LEP area, including the Elonex advanced engineering supply chain and Alamo Manufacturing bids, which I am sure he welcomes, because they and others will create many thousands of jobs in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.3/2">The hon. Member for Coventry South said there was little evidence of private sector growth. I simply dispute that statement. The core city deal for Birmingham, which was mentioned by both hon. Gentlemen, will have spillover effects for the wider west midlands region, although I hear the call for me to speak about Coventry in its own right.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.3/3">The hon. Member for Coventry South raised concerns about the impact of regional pay&#8212;those were his words&#8212;across the country. I reassure him that the Government are not setting out detailed proposals at this stage, but simply asking the experts how public sector pay might better reflect local markets. He will be aware that the Institute for Fiscal Studies made an estimate of the public sector pay premium&#8212;he quoted off-hand some figures in that respect. In principle, the premium has the potential to hurt private sector businesses, which need to compete with higher public sector wages. A premium could prevent them from expanding and lead to unfair variation in the quality of public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.3/4">On public spending, the previous Government left an appalling financial mess behind, which this Government have a moral obligation to sort out. We have delivered a challenging but fair settlement for local government, including for Coventry. The formula grant in Coventry will be &#163;493 per person in 2012-13. The average per person across England is far lower, and it is &#163;200 to &#163;300 per person in some southern areas. That reflects the higher level of need in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.3/5">I thank the hon. Gentlemen for speaking in the debate. I believe the approach set out in the Budget is a strong one and am confident that it will benefit all areas of the country, including Coventry and its environs.</p>
