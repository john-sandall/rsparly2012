	<p pid="a.804.4/1">The Minister will be aware that about 75% of Palestinians in Gaza depend on food aid from UNRWA, and with the massively increased number of demolitions of homes in Jerusalem and the west bank by Israeli forces, UNRWA&#8217;s work is vital to Palestinians. The Government have a good record on funding. Will he give a commitment that that will continue, and will he work to ensure that the international community recognises UNRWA&#8217;s importance?</p>

We view such demolitions and evictions as causing unnecessary suffering to ordinary Palestinians and as harmful to the peace process.

	<p pid="a.804.7/1">My hon. Friend is right to point out that UNRWA&#8217;s remit extends beyond the Palestinian territories themselves. Conditions in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan remain fragile, and DFID funds UNRWA to provide essential services to all these refugees across the region. In 2011 our support helped to provide maternal health care to 263,000 women, education for 45,000 children, and food and income support for 29,000 refugees. We are in close contact with UNRWA as it strives to maintain services in Syria.</p>

	<p pid="a.805.0/1">May I particularly welcome the extra funding recently announced for the 400,000-plus refugees in Lebanon to help fund health care and education for thousands of children?

	<p pid="a.805.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right and I am sure that the vast majority of Members in this House agree with him. The permanent plight of someone who is an everlasting refugee is not something that any of us would relish, and it is the peace process that we hope can eventually give a permanent settlement and solution for those who are so affected.</p>

The situation is that some two thirds of those who were in imminent danger of starving to death are no longer in that position, and Britain has been involved in quite literally saving something like half a million lives in the last year. Huge lobbying is still required. Britain has made it clear that we will produce assistance over the next year, specifically to tackle acute malnourishment, providing seeds, fertiliser and clean water, but the whole international community must take up this task.</p>

Some 60% of Britain&#8217;s development support for Somalia goes into Somaliland, but as the Foreign Secretary has made clear recently, it is extremely important that Somaliland and Puntland settle the dispute on their border as speedily as possible.

What are the Government doing, on their own account and through the European Union, to strengthen AMISOM&#8212;the African Union Mission in Somalia&#8212;and improve security in Somalia?</p>

The processes that come out of that will not be led by the international community or Britain; they need to be owned by the Somalis, led by the Somalis and the countries of the region, and strongly supported by the international community.</p>

However, the report is right in identifying the importance of long-term action to support resilience. As for the Sahel, Britain is not going to lead there, but we have announced a significant amount of support, specifically: therapeutic feeding for 68,000 children; support with food and water for 50,000 people; and support in terms of seeds and vaccinations for cattle for 30,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.807.7/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question; his knowledge of that part of the world is indeed deep, not least because of the tremendous contribution that his wife made to supporting the people of South Sudan some years ago. More than 85,000 refugees have arrived in South Sudan, fleeing the conflict over the border. There are 25,000 in Unity, and 61,000 in Maban. In Warrup county, the humanitarian community is supporting 110,000 people who have been displaced from Abyei since 2011. In addition, 360,000 have already been assisted in coming down from Sudan, with a potential 700,000 still to come. This is placing enormous strain on the emergency and humanitarian response, but the UK is playing a lead role and, in December, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a two-year package of support for the humanitarian funds. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

He had direct discussions on this matter with the chairman of the commission, with President Mbeki and with Prime Minister Meles. People are focused on the question of an appropriate mandate, but the current position is that it is better to deploy into the right places the troops who have been mandated, rather than distract ourselves with a review of the mandate itself.</p>

Literally hundreds of people were getting &#163;1 million bonuses and he signed it off. The issue for the right hon.

It is just that we are expected to listen to the people who presided over the biggest banking and financial disaster in our history and it is not as if they had nothing to do with it. One of them was the City Minister and the other was sitting in the Treasury. I have to ask: who failed to regulate the banks? Labour. Who gave us the boom and bust? Labour.

	<p pid="a.814.5/2">I have looked very carefully at the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s propositions and I do not think it is practical to do what he is suggesting. It breaks an important principle of not having people on a remuneration committee who will have their own pay determined, so I do not think that it is the right way forward. The House might be interested to know, as I have looked carefully at all his proposals, that he also proposed in Glasgow to ban performance-related pay in all but the most exceptional circumstances. That is completely wrong. There are people working in offices, factories and shops around the country who want performance-related pay and who, if they meet some targets, would like to have a bonus at the end of the year. That is pro-aspiration and pro-doing the right thing for your family. That shows that the right hon. Gentleman has not a clue about how to run an economy.</p>

They have not yet awarded the contract, and I would say to my right hon. Friend, who I know cares deeply, as I do, about the people employed in his constituency, that we do not expect any job losses to stem from this decision and that it does not rule out Typhoon for India.

In terms of what the hon. Lady</p>
	<p pid="a.818.5/2">says about disability, I would make two points. First, disability living allowance&#8212;the absolutely key benefit&#8212;is going up by 5.2% this April, which will be well ahead of inflation. The point I would make about universal credit is that the lower rate for disabled children is &#163;53, as she will know. Anyone on that level will be completely protected through transitional payments. We have not yet set the higher rate, but I can tell the hon.

	<p pid="a.823.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require security search arrangements at airports to ensure that appropriate levels of privacy are provided for people with disabilities; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/3">The Bill would require Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to take measures to ensure that the dignity of stoma bag users and other disabled people is protected at airport security checkpoints throughout the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/4">Many people who face life-threatening health conditions such as bowel and bladder cancer and Crohn&#8217;s disease must undergo surgery, such as colostomies and urostomies. Such surgery should not end their right to travel, whether it be for business, for pleasure or to see friends and family, nor should it end their right to be treated with dignity while doing so. Unfortunately, that is what often occurs.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/5">One of my constituents who has had cancer and who requires the use of both urostomy and colostomy pouches attended my surgery to tell me of the humiliation that she has faced at several airports throughout the European Union. She requested my assistance in preventing future such occurrences. She explained that the security personnel at Budapest airport were far from sympathetic. After a pat-down search, they wanted to examine her underwear, despite her attempts to explain that she had colostomy pouches. She was required to attempt to explain that to them in public, in front of fellow holidaymakers in the security queue&#8212;an experience she described as &#8220;totally degrading&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/6">Sadly, such practices and such a lack of sympathy are not unique to that case. My constituent told me how she had faced poor treatment at an airport in the north-east. A rudimentary internet search reveals similar instances at airports throughout the world, including at John F. Kennedy airport in New York and Tampa in Florida. At John Lennon airport in Liverpool, a colostomy bag user from Ballymena faced a public search. Although it is vital to ensure that aerospace flights are secure, one would hope that in such circumstances, airport security staff would act with compassion, humanity and common sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/7">My constituent had a card and a doctor&#8217;s letter, with an explanation of her situation in several languages. She faced problems because she was separated from them when her hand luggage was scanned. The man from Ballymena also had a letter signed by his doctor and even offered to be searched privately. His letter and request were apparently ignored by the Securitas guard. Such practices must surely be regarded as a violation of a passenger&#8217;s fundamental and inalienable right to be treated with dignity, and they must cease.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/8">The Bill would address those problems. The British Government would be compelled to ensure that all airport security staff in the United Kingdom with responsibility for searching passengers were trained in preserving the dignity of stoma patients while maintaining our security. Furthermore, the Bill would address these</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/9">issues throughout the European Union by compelling the Foreign Secretary to urge the European Commission to amend regulation No. 300/2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security to require all airport security staff in the EU to be so trained. The Government would also be expected to lobby for such training to be mandated worldwide by the International Civil Aviation Organisation through the Chicago convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/10">This issue must affect thousands of British citizens every year, but sadly it attracts little attention. I hope that Members recognise that granting this Bill a Second Reading is an opportunity for this House to make a difference to people&#8217;s lives by ensuring that their right to dignity is respected.</p>

	<p pid="a.826.6/1">Throughout the process of the Bill in both this House and the other place, we have listened carefully to the concerns that have been raised. We have taken them on board wherever possible and provided important clarifications on the Government&#8217;s position and responses to technical concerns. However, let us be clear that we stand firmly behind the aims and detail of our reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.826.6/2">As you indicated, Mr Speaker, Lords amendments 15, 17, 18 and 23 impinge on the financial privileges of this House. I ask the House to disagree to those amendments, and I will ask the Reasons Committee to ascribe financial privilege as the reason for doing so. It cannot be denied that we are in extremely difficult financial times, and that the Government have no choice but to take measures to address the situation. Tackling the unsustainable rise in spending on benefits and tax credits, as part of the Government&#8217;s overall deficit reduction strategy, is undeniably important. However, I emphasise that the affordability of the welfare system is just one objective of the reforms being introduced in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.826.6/3">We are making principled reforms that will finally tackle the trap of welfare dependency. Universal credit will ensure that work always pays, lifting 900,000 individuals out of poverty, including more than 350,000 children and about 550,000 working-age adults. The Bill will also deliver fairness for claimants and for the taxpayers who fund the system. We will discuss the benefit cap in the next group of Lords amendments, but it is clearly not fair, for example, that households on out-of-work benefits should receive a greater income from benefits than the average earnings of working households. Finally, our reforms will radically simplify the system, ensuring that it is easier for claimants to understand and for staff</p>
	<p pid="a.826.6/4">to administer. Hon. Members should be clear that those are vital principles, of which financial considerations are only one part.</p>
	<p pid="a.826.6/5">I turn specifically to the provisions on employment and support allowance that are dealt with by this group of amendments. I shall set out the Government&#8217;s full rationale for rejecting the Lords amendments. First, Lords amendment 15 was simply a paving amendment that had no effect. Lords amendment 17 would increase the time limit for claimants receiving contributory ESA in the work-related activity group from the proposed 365 days to a minimum of 730 days, which would have to be prescribed in regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.827.0/1">On contributory benefit, does the Minister accept that giving a person who has made a recovery after suffering from cancer only 365 days to get back into work is a little prescriptive? Does he accept that the Lords amendment would allow them additional time&#8212;up to two years&#8212;to get back into work? The amendment is about fairness for those people alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.827.1/1">I will to talk in more detail about cancer, which is one of the measures we are addressing. I accept that there are anxieties in respect of cancer, but the approach that we are taking to all our reforms, and particularly those relating to sickness and disability, is that we should not write off automatically any individual with a particular condition. Applying a one-size-fits-all measure to any one condition is the wrong thing to do.</p>

Are the national insurance measures designed to shape and change behaviour, and in what way will they do so, or are they merely just to save money? In other words, is the Minister doing what the Treasury has required him to do on national insurance?</p>

	<p pid="a.827.3/1">The important thing about that measure is that we must have a welfare system in which people have confidence. The principle of our proposal reflects the principle used in the jobseeker&#8217;s allowance system&#8212;people should get something back for what they have contributed, but not indefinitely. The Government&#8217;s measures simply seek to extend that principle to the group on ESA.</p>

	<p pid="a.827.5/1">The principle I described is a long-standing one that has been applied to other benefits, such as jobseeker&#8217;s allowance. It is important to state that the Government are not taking benefits away from people who have no other form of income, or from people in the support group who need long-term, unconditional help. The measure simply affects those in the work-related activity group. It applies to them the same principle that exists in jobseeker&#8217;s allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.828.0/1">Does not the Government&#8217;s proposal conflict with what they are trying to do?

	<p pid="a.828.1/1">The principle of the welfare state that I described&#8212;that it is there to provide a safety net for those who have no other form of income&#8212;has operated for a very long time, including under the previous Government. The welfare state provides a degree of support to those who have another form of income, but it is a long-standing principle of the jobseeker&#8217;s allowance system that such support is not unlimited. We are simply applying that same principle to ESA for people who are deemed to have the potential, in due course, to return to work.</p>

What is so obnoxious about the Government&#8217;s measures is that the most vulnerable are being hit, meaning not only cancer patients, but others with life-threatening diseases. It seems that the Government are totally indifferent to the group of people who will be harmed as a result of their proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.828.5/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we have to have a system that is fair both to the taxpayer who pays for it and to the recipients. As a result of these reforms, we will have a system that is fairer to those receiving support and also fairer to those who are paying for that support.</p>
	<p pid="a.828.5/2">Support to find work, for those people who will be affected, will be available for all ESA claimants from the outset of their claim, through Jobcentre Plus on a voluntary basis until the outcome of the work capability assessment and, following the WCA, for those claimants placed in the work-related activity group, through Jobcentre Plus or through the Work programme. Every single person who is on ESA, including those on a contributory basis, has access to the Work programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.828.5/3">Some have said that the limit is arbitrary. I do not accept that. As the Minister with responsibility for welfare reform explained in the other place, it is similar to that applied by several countries around the world, including France, Ireland and Spain, and strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of sick and disabled people claiming benefit and those who have to contribute towards the cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.829.1/1">I can indeed confirm that that is the case. We have listened very carefully on this issue, and it was a point well made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40145" name="Jennifer Willott">the Member for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> in Committee. We have listened and we have taken appropriate action. It is important that we look at such details to ensure that we get them right, but that does not detract from the overall principle of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.1/2">I believe that a time limit of one year is the correct approach. It applies the right balance between restricting access to contributory benefits and allowing those with longer term illnesses to adjust to their health condition and surrounding circumstances. There is also a very strong financial argument. If accepted, this amendment would reduce the total savings in the spending review period by around a third by 2016-17, which is &#163;1.6 billion. Given the current fiscal climate, we cannot afford to forgo these savings and this is one of a number of very difficult decisions the Government have had to make because, as the shadow Secretary of State pointed out at the time, there was no money left.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.1/3">Lords amendment 18 would mean that no time limit would be applied to contributory ESA for those claimants receiving treatment for cancer if they have or are treated as having limited capability for work, or they have or are treated as having limited capability for work as a consequence of a cancer diagnosis. The whole point of our approach on these matters is that we have always looked at the effects of a condition on an individual, rather than at the condition itself. We can all think of other cases which could equally be regarded as special cases. We are trying to be sensitive to the very real concerns of individuals suffering from cancer, and since we took office we have made significant changes to improve the protection and support that we provide to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.1/4">Most individuals with cancer are placed in the support group at the outset of their treatment. We have increased the scope of the support group for cancer patients. We have been working closely with Macmillan Cancer Relief to improve how the WCA assesses individuals being treated for cancer. We are now consulting on our proposals, following work by Macmillan and Professor Harrington, our independent assessor of the work capability assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.1/5">We are clear that our proposals, which are now out to consultation, include a presumption that someone with cancer will be in the support group. What we simply do</p>
	<p pid="a.829.1/6">not accept is that in all circumstances, regardless of the impact of cancer on an individual&#8217;s ability to work or otherwise, they should be guaranteed a position in the support group. We have not taken that approach with any other condition and we do not believe that we should take it with cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.830.1/1">It is very much our intention&#8212;especially for those who have finished their treatment but are not yet prepared to return to work&#8212;to have a simple system that enables a medical professional to indicate to us that that person is not yet sufficiently recovered to make a return to work. Our proposals are out to consultation at the moment, but our overall clear goal is that, in the vast majority of cases, someone who is undergoing treatment for cancer or is recovering from the aftermath of that treatment should be in the support group. What we cannot accept is a principle for absolutely all cases and regardless of circumstance, and some people with cancer do work&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.830.3/1">The issue comes back to the core principle of why we are imposing the time limit. We are not taking benefits away from people who do not have other financial means. The people who will be affected by the 12-month time limit&#8212;not just cancer patients, but generally&#8212;are those who either have another household income or who have many thousands of pounds of savings in the bank. They are the ones affected. We are not taking contributory support away from those people in the support group. Most cancer patients, as I have just described, will be in that support group. We are not taking benefits away from them, just from those with other financial means.</p>

	<p pid="a.830.5/1">No, I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.5/2">If amendment 18 were accepted, it is estimated that it would cost around &#163;90 million cumulatively by 2016-17 based on a two-year time limit, or around &#163;140 million cumulatively based on a one-year time limit. That would be a significant additional cost for the taxpayer, and would fly in the face of a principle that we have tried to bring to this whole process, which is that we do not bracket any condition into one absolute position. We look at each individual case to understand the impact of the condition on the ability to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.5/3">The third area of focus this afternoon is our proposed changes to the condition relating to entitlement to ESA on grounds of limited capability during youth. These changes are part of our principled approach to reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.5/4">We want to modernise and simplify the current welfare system, focus support, avoid duplication of provision and redefine the contract between the state and individuals, in advance of the introduction of universal credit. It cannot be right that, for example, where a claimant has qualified for contributory ESA under the youth provisions and some years later they receive a substantial inheritance, they should be able to continue to receive unlimited contributory ESA without the need to have paid any contributions and without any condition from the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.5/5">These proposals will not affect those in receipt of income-related ESA. We expect that around 90% of those who presently receive ESA on youth grounds will be eligible for income-related ESA. It will be a simple transition from their point of view. Only some 10% will not qualify because they have other means available to them&#8212;and I emphasise that that means a partner in full-time work or capital of more than &#163;16,000. We are merely targeting the support the Government can provide to where it is needed most. I do not think it is right that someone with independent income or capital should be able to access state support on a long-term, ongoing and unconditional basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.831.0/1">Can the Minister clarify absolutely that a 20-year-old who will never work and who lives at home with their parents will be able to get income-related ESA? Obviously it cannot be contributory as they have made no national insurance contributions. Even if they live in a household above income support levels, will they continue to get income-related ESA in their own right?</p>

	<p pid="a.831.1/1">I cannot give an undertaking in all circumstances, because every circumstance will be different. But 90% of those who presently receive ESA on youth grounds will be eligible for income-related ESA. It will depend on the circumstances of each individual case.</p>
	<p pid="a.831.1/2">We have already mentioned the fact that the Government amendments allow claimants to re-qualify for a further award of contributory ESA after their ESA has ceased as a result of time limiting, and they are later placed in the support group because of a deterioration in their health. That applies equally to ESA youth claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.831.1/3">There is, however, another factor to take into account&#8212;and this, again, is an example of why this is about more than just money. We must also consider the impact of the Stewart judgment given in the European Court on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-21">21 July 2011</phrase>, as a result of which someone living abroad can qualify for benefit without having to satisfy the past presence test, if they can demonstrate a genuine and sufficient link to the United Kingdom. The Court determined that Ms Stewart arguably could demonstrate a link with the UK because she was in receipt of another UK benefit, was dependent on her parents, who were UK pensioners, and had spent a significant part of her life in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.831.1/4">We want people to qualify only if they have lived in the UK recently prior to the claim, but we are also obliged to take account of the Court&#8217;s case-law view of what constitutes a sufficient link. We strongly disagree with the Court&#8217;s ruling. The effect of that EU judgment is that we can no longer have a blanket past presence test of this kind for benefit claimants. As a result, the</p>
	<p pid="a.831.1/5">ESA youth provision is potentially more widely available than intended, and given that we are bound by EU law, there is nothing, short of abolition, that we can do by way of domestic legislation&#8212;even primary legislation&#8212;to change its effect. As a consequence, we could end up paying this benefit, on a long-term unconditional basis, to more people who have never lived in the United Kingdom but who can simply demonstrate a link to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.832.1/1">It relates to someone who has not lived in the UK for most of the past 15 years, although she is a British national and has a link to the UK. The implication of the court case is that somebody who has a link to the UK but who has had no recent contact with it is none the less entitled to receive benefits. That is where we disagree with the European Court and why we think that its decision was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.1/2">We think that the best way to close this door is to abolish the ESA youth provision, but it is not the only reason we are abolishing the youth provision. It is by no means the sole rationale for doing so, but as a matter of principle it is our view that we should make every effort to ensure that our benefits are paid only to those whom we think should be paid UK benefits&#8212;those who have recent connections to, or have lived in, the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.832.5/1">I would love to secure a more pragmatic and sensible approach to the regulation of social security in Europe. I have been working on it for the past 18 months with my counterparts in other member states, and I hope that we will make progress as soon as possible. Right now, however, we must obey European case law as delivered to us by the European Court&#8212;much though it sometimes might be frustrating to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.5/2">I have a couple of technical points to make before I finish. As a result of providing for the new category of entitlement, in respect of claimants whose health has deteriorated to such a degree that they are placed in the support group&#8212;I referred to this earlier in response to</p>
	<p pid="a.832.5/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" name="Anne Begg">the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase>&#8212;it has been necessary to remove the substance of the ESA youth time-limiting measure from the original clause 52 and to insert it into clause 51 via a new subsection in section 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007. The Opposition amended that new subsection by changing the period of the time limit from 365 days to a period to be prescribed of at least 730 days. That is Lords amendment 19. As a result, the House will need to agree to amendment 19 but with an amendment consequential upon the rejection of the other amendments providing for entitlement to ESA to be for 730 days rather than 365 days. This will restore the Government&#8217;s intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.5/4">A similar complexity surrounds amendment 22, which was voted for in the other place and which ensures that no new claims can be made under the youth provisions in the future&#8212;in effect, from whenever that provision is commenced by order. This amendment would amend clause 52 by removing the substance of ESA youth time limiting, which is now included in clause 51, but would retain the key provision in clause 52 preventing new ESA youth claims from being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.5/5">I am afraid that this position is further complicated by the fact that also in the other place amendment 23 was not pushed to a vote and therefore also stands part of the Bill. Amendment 23 effectively allows claims to be made to contributory ESA under the youth provisions for those that are placed in the support group. We therefore now have two conflicting clauses for conditions relating to youth. Finally, if amendment 23 were to be accepted, it would reduce the expected cumulative benefit savings by around &#163;17 million by 2016-17&#8212;savings that would need to be found elsewhere in the benefits system.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.5/6">In the light of these arguments&#8212;the urgent need to address the fiscal deficit we have inherited and the need to deliver principled reform to our welfare state&#8212;I hope that hon. Members will feel able to support the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.833.0/1">The Government are determined to insert some terrible things into the Bill, and none of them is worse than the indefensible one-year time limit on contributory employment and support allowance for people in the work-related activity group. Amendment 17 removes that one-year limit. The Government are trying to put it back. Now, with the blanket appeal that we have heard for financial privilege, they are trying to prevent the other place from daring to disagree with them once again.</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/2">The measure is literally indefensible: the Government have been unable to defend it. The Minister made no effort to defend it in his speech, other than to point out that it would save a great deal of money. He referred to what happens in other European countries, but there, of course, the support that people fall back on is much more generous than here. There is no defence for the one-year time limit, and the House needs to be aware that this change will start to impact in two months&#8217; time, at the beginning of April. According to the Government, 100,000 people will lose contributory benefits at the beginning of April this year, having already been in receipt of contributory ESA for more than one year, and another 100,000 will lose it as they reach the one-year stage of their claim over the following 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/3">Some people argue that ESA should not be limited at all&#8212;for example, the Liberal Democrats. At their party conference, they opposed any arbitrary time limit on how long claimants can claim contributory ESA, and the Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Thomas of Winchester told Members of the other place that what troubled the conference last year was</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/4">&#8220;the arbitrary nature of the one-year cut-off.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2012-01-11.158"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 January 2012; Vol. 734, c. 158</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/5">Liberal Democrat party policy is clear on this, but we understand that today its elected representatives will take no notice of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/6">The Lords amendments that the Government want to overturn are much more modest. They argue that the time limit should be not less than two years and, crucially, that the limit should be set down in regulations rather than in primary legislation. If the Government get their way, absurdly it would require a new Act of Parliament to change the limit. Throughout debates on the Bill&#8212;many Members have been present in Committee and other stages of the Bill&#8212;the Minister has told us that the purpose of the Bill is to provide the structure and that the details would be in regulations. On this measure, however, with no explanation, the opposite approach has been applied. These debates provide a clear indication of whether Ministers mean what they say when they tell us these things, or whether they are simply reading the script put in front of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.833.0/7">We do not quarrel with time limiting. As the Minister said, contributory jobseeker&#8217;s allowance has been time-limited to six months for many years. The rationale has always been that within six months more than 90% of jobseekers are back in work. If it is to be fair, however, a time limit for ESA must also give people a reasonable chance to get back into work. A year is not enough. The Government&#8217;s own figures suggest that 94% of those who qualify for ESA are still on it a year later, so fewer than 6% are managing to get into a job within a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.834.1/1">The question is: how long do people need to be on ESA before they get back into work?

	<p pid="a.834.3/1">I answered the Minister&#8217;s question. What his figures show is that only 6% of those who go on to ESA&#8212;no doubt many of them will have been on statutory sick pay before that&#8212;are in a position to come off the benefit within one year. That is not a reasonable chance to get back to work, as I think the Minister will recognise if he reflects on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.3/2">As the Minister said, Lords amendment 18 specifically addresses cancer. I do not think that anyone in this House will be surprised to learn that, for many cancer patients, 12 months is not long enough to become well enough to get back into work. At 12 months, many people are still experiencing debilitating physical and psychological effects from the cancer and from its treatment. People cannot go back to work in those circumstances, and that is why Macmillan Cancer Relief, which my right hon.

Now, when his health is failing, he will be left on the poverty line. He draws the obvious conclusion&#8212;this picks up on the point that my right hon.

	<p pid="a.835.2/1">Before my right hon. Friend moves on, perhaps he could dwell on that point. The Government rightly say that this Bill is about changing and shaping behaviour, and for all of us in this House, it is important to know that this year we will probably crash through the &#163;200 billion mark. Anybody who thinks that that does not affect people&#8217;s behaviour is living in cloud cuckoo land. However, what message is this Bill sending out, when those who have provided and paid their contributions will get no benefits if there is any other income in their house, whereas those who have not played by the rules&#8212;who have decided that they will coast it on the back of taxpayers&#8212;get rewards?</p>

	<p pid="a.838.3/1">Those figures were quoted extensively in our debate. Our view is simply this: we should not be taking large sums of money from people who are recovering from cancer or from a stroke, and who have been told throughout their lives that if they paid into the national insurance system, they would be able to get help when they needed it. That pledge needs to be honoured, even by this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.3/2">Let me turn to Lords amendment 15 and the question of the youth passport. It is astonishing that the spiteful policy towards disabled young people remained in the Bill for so long. It is even more astonishing to see the Minister now trying to ram it back in today, after the other place took it out. The current principle is that people who have been disabled since birth or childhood should be passported on to a contributory benefit. In Committee, the Minister described the principle as an &#8220;oddity&#8221;, but it has been well established since the 1970s and backed by Tory Ministers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Only now are this Government trying to scrap it. It provides an independent income for severely disabled people whose disability started before they had a chance to work. The Minister wants to deny them that. The principle that young people who are disabled from birth ought to be able to rely on a secure independent income might seem odd to him; to most people, it is simply right.</p>

	<p pid="a.838.5/3">&#8220;puts those previously eligible for ESA &#8216;youth&#8217; on an equal footing with others who have to satisfy the relevant National Insurance conditions before they qualify for contributory ESA, which will create a simpler system&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.5/4">It will not put them on an equal footing. They have been unable to work since before they had a chance to work, or at least to build up two years of contributions, as my hon. Friend points out. They have had no chance to build up their contributions, and they are therefore at a disadvantage, compared with everybody else. Attempting to justify the proposal&#8212;in frankly Orwellian terms&#8212;as a simplification really takes the biscuit. We are talking about a small group&#8212;15,000 people&#8212;who have never had a chance to build up a contribution record. It is right that they should be treated differently. A little complexity is necessary for fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.5/5">It is worth looking at how much money the Government will save by overturning this amendment. It involves a fair amount of contributory ESA &#8212;Ministers in the other place said &#163;70 million. However, many of those young people&#8212;the Minister said it would be 90%&#8212;will be entitled to income-related benefit if they lose their contributory benefit. Furthermore, the amendment from the other place is very narrow. It applies only to the support group&#8212;that is, those who the Government accept should be protected from ESA time-limiting. The net annual saving from this spiteful cut will be about a quarter of the amount that the state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will hand out in executive bonuses this year. It will be less than &#163;10 million a year.</p>

My hon. Friend was seeking an assurance that some other provision would be put in place to safeguard the young person, but the Minister was unable to give her such an assurance, because I do not think that that is the Government&#8217;s intention.

	<p pid="a.841.8/1">That is absolutely right; that is how the Government are changing the system. Disabled young people, in recognition of their particular circumstances, have been assured since the 1970s&#8212;under Governments of both parties&#8212;of an independent income from the state. This Government are taking it away from them. As a result of this change, they will lose that</p>

I may be a simple Member of Parliament who fails to understand this complex issue, but the all-party parliamentary group for young disabled people, which I chair, has asked me expressly to raise this issue, which is at the heart of its concerns about this amendment. I would welcome some clarification of how the Government think people will behave in real life as opposed to in the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.842.2/5">I shall not detain the House any longer. The Government have my full support on these amendments, but I would like more clarity about how they view their implementation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.843.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" speakername="Anne Begg" colnum="843"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0002.htm#12020160003465">
	<p pid="a.843.0/1">Let me say from the outset that I support the Lords amendments and do not agree with the Government&#8217;s motion to disagree. I shall talk about two main aspects: one is the time limitation and the second is the can of worms that I have managed to open this afternoon about the youth rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/2">The time limit is unfair to people who have worked all their lives, done the right thing and thought that part of their payment of national insurance would provide them with some kind of insurance scheme so that if an unfortunate accident or ill health befell them, they would qualify for an income replacement benefit&#8212;in this case, employment support allowance&#8212;regardless of their actual income. People believed that it would work like any other insurance policy and would pay out if the unfortunate happened. The Government are breaking that link between the concept of an insurance policy and how much and for how long it will pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/3">People suffering from cancer are often used as an example of a group that will fall into the work-related activity category of ESA: cancer patients will often not be well enough to go back to work within the year. Other groups of people have fluctuating conditions and some have slowly progressive neurological conditions. From everything the Minister said today, the assumption seems to be that people in the work-related activity group will move towards work, but some will be on the opposite journey, moving further and further away from work as their condition deteriorates.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/4">Because we assess people not on their condition but on how their condition affects them when they go through the assessment, someone with multiple sclerosis or in the early stages of Huntington&#8217;s disease might not qualify for the ESA group, might end up in the WRA group and might qualify only some time in the future. They are likely to be a group that has already been in work and will have fallen out of work precisely because they have been diagnosed with these conditions. Although many of us&#8212;and probably those people, too&#8212;want to be in work, we live in the real world where employers will often not take the risk of employing someone with that type of condition, especially if the person has already lost one job precisely because of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/5">I think the time limit is arbitrary and unfair, and I wish the Government would look at it again. The two-year provision is arbitrary as well&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>In fact, I do not agree with time-limited provisions at all, but this is the best we have; it is twice as good as the Government&#8217;s proposal. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I am sorry that some Conservative Members at the back of the Chamber find this so funny. The people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease and MS do not find it funny. It is their lives that are being undermined, and it is they who will not have an independent income.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/6">It is my constituents&#8212;and, indeed, those of Government Members sitting at the back of the Chamber&#8212;who, because they have saved all their lives, will not qualify for income-related ESA and will suffer as a result. They will lose their independent incomes, and their household incomes, although they may have been cataclysmically affected, may still be too high for them to qualify for income support. Despite what those Government Members sitting at the back may think, income support levels are very low, and the actual level of income on which such households will have to live will therefore not be what they may have expected.</p>

	<p pid="a.844.1/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. It is not a lifestyle choice to be diagnosed with a progressive, debilitating condition. It is hard. It is difficult. Individuals in that position face enough prejudice in society already, probably from the employers who told them that they could no longer do their jobs. That is why they need to apply for and claim benefit: because they have already faced that prejudice, which the Government may be making even worse. It is hard for those people, and we are making it harder.</p>

	<p pid="a.844.3/1">Indeed. As I said earlier, the people who will be punished most are those who have done the right thing. They are the ones who have been in work, the ones who have saved, and the ones who have partners who have been in work and remain in work. It would be much easier for their partners to drop out of work as well, because they and their partners would then, as a household, qualify for the benefit. That would probably be the wrong thing to do from the point of view of the family, but given such a benefits system&#8212;I was going to say &#8220;a benefits system that would make them better off&#8221;, but it might not do that&#8212;it will become a logical choice for a working partner in those circumstances to give up work. Although it would probably be wrong, it would be logical.</p>

	<p pid="a.845.7/2">I think that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s intervention illustrates some of the confusion that exists. Some Members seem to believe that losing a job because of ill health is exactly the same as losing a job by being made redundant, but it is not. As was pointed out by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>, the chance of obtaining another job is far, far higher for someone who has been made redundant than for someone who has lost his job because he has received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, or because he has had a major road accident which means that he is now dependent on a wheelchair to survive. Those conditions are different, and they should therefore be treated differently in the national insurance and, indeed, the benefits system.</p>

	<p pid="a.845.9/1">At present, those on incapacity benefit&#8212;the existing benefit, which the Government are to replace&#8212;who have made the necessary national insurance contributions will keep that benefit until they return to work. Is the hon. Gentleman saying the costing should be done on any other basis? Obviously, the reason the Government are introducing the time limit is to save money: there can be no other reason, as the hon. Gentleman has effectively admitted. This is the result of</p>
	<p pid="a.845.9/2">a money-saving decision by the Government. It is not about being fair; it is about saving money to deal with the debt and the deficit, which were not caused by the people&#8212;and their partners, wives and husbands&#8212;who have tried throughout their lives to do the right thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.845.9/3">I am conscious of the time, but I now want to say something about the youth rate. When I intervened on the Minister, I was genuinely trying to obtain some clarification, but I have ended up even more confused than before about how the youth rate will work and which groups of young people will no longer receive an independent&#8212;that word is important&#8212;income replacement benefit. They may receive non-means-tested benefits and, for instance, disability living allowance or the new personal independence payment, but they will not have any income.</p>
	<p pid="a.845.9/4">Let me give an example of someone I think will be caught by that, someone who came to my constituency office a number of years ago. He was a young lad of 20 who had been in work for six months when he was diagnosed with a virulent condition. I cannot remember what it was, but it meant that he would be unlikely to work again, and indeed his condition was going to deteriorate. This young man lived with his girlfriend, who earned about &#163;15,000 or &#163;16,000 a year, just over the income support level. Under the measures proposed by the Government, he would not qualify for any income at all. He would be wholly dependent on his girlfriend, and the household income would consist only of her income. That does not strike me as right, and it does not strike me as fair. I should be grateful if, before we vote on the amendment, the Minister would tell us exactly which group of people will lose out as a result of the abolition of the contributory youth rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.846.1/1">The household might possibly get housing benefit, but that goes on paying the rent. The young man might get disability living allowance, but that is paid because he has extra expenses due to his disability. What he does not have is an income. He has no money to go to the pub for a pint, to buy clothes, or to do anything that the rest of us, disabled or not, take for granted. He has no independent income. It is totally different if someone is out of work and unemployed. I am disappointed that those on the Government Benches cannot see that distinction, and cannot see that those who are long-term ill or disabled, and who have no prospect of improving their financial circumstances themselves because of the level of their disability, are being penalised by the Government. That is partly why I most certainly will support the Lords amendments this afternoon, and I encourage right hon. and hon. Members to do so, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.846.2/1">Returning to the issue of the time-limited employment and support allowance, there is real concern about an arbitrary time limit. As was kindly pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>, at a party conference the Liberal Democrats showed their concern by passing a motion against arbitrary</p>
	<p pid="a.846.2/2">time limits. However, the amendment from the Lords and the Government&#8217;s original proposal both set arbitrary time limits; it is just that one is longer than the other. Neither of the options in front of us would get rid of an arbitrary time limit, as a number of Members have highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.2/3">One way to make the system less arbitrary is to ensure that people are in the right category in the first place, with those in the greatest need in the support group, so that they are not affected by a time limit. My colleagues and I have looked long and hard at the issue, and the important thing is to get the assessment right in the first place and make sure that people are in the right category, as those in the support group are exempt from the time limit. We need to make sure that people who need long-term, indefinite support are in the support group and can get that. That is a more effective way to protect those who need the most help than changing one arbitrary time limit for another.</p>

	<p pid="a.847.5/2">The Harrington process is critical to getting the assessment right. I welcome the work that has been done looking specifically at cancer patients, which will ensure that the vast majority go into the support group. That is the right way forward. I also welcome the fact that Professor Harrington is looking at how we assess chronic pain and fatigue, because in many chronic, long-term conditions&#8212;particularly fluctuating conditions&#8212;those are the elements that cause people most difficulty in thinking about returning to work, and the elements that, at the moment, the work capability assessment is not very good at identifying and reflecting. I really hope that Ministers will implement whatever recommendations Professor Harrington makes on those issues; on past experience, his recommendations have been sensible and have made a significant difference to the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.847.5/3">On the point made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, there is evidence that the system is improving. I looked earlier today at the latest figures on the outcome of the work capability assessments, which I found quite reassuring when it comes to the Bill. We have to treat the figures with caution, but they show that initially, following the work capability assessment, more people are going into the support group than the work-related activity group. That is a crucial point. If we are getting the assessment right, and more people are going into the support group in the first place, the time-limit for people in the work-related activity group becomes less of an issue, because the people who need the most care are getting support indefinitely.</p>

	<p pid="a.848.2/1">It is important that we put it on record for the House once again that, possibly with a tiny number of exceptions, no appeals have yet been completed following the introduction of the Harrington reforms.

	<p pid="a.848.3/1">I am grateful to the Minister, and I hope that when the figures flow through on appeals that have taken place under the new system, we see a reduction in the number of decisions overturned, and in the number of people who go to appeal. That would suggest that the assessment was working properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.3/2">If we make sure that the assessment works properly, it will reduce the arbitrariness of the timetable, but as the Minister mentioned in an intervention on the Opposition spokesman, the right hon. Member for East Ham, it is important that we recognise that many people will receive six months&#8217; statutory sick pay before they go on to the ESA, so they will be receiving benefits for 18 months. It is important that the Government continue the work that is being done to look at ensuring that employers work with staff when they become disabled or fall sick, and do not immediately push them on to ESA. Instead, employees should get the support that they need, possibly to stay in work over an extended period, and get their full entitlement to statutory sick pay and ESA, so that they get the full 18 months&#8217; support to which many of them will be entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.848.4/1">The hon. Lady set out the fact that there was objection at her party conference to an arbitrary time limit. Does she accept the case for setting the limit, whatever it should be, in regulations instead of in the Bill? Putting it in the Bill means that it will take another Act of Parliament to change it in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.848.5/1">There needs to be some stability, so that people know what to expect. One of the problems with putting that type of provision in regulations is that it becomes very difficult for people to know what they can expect. That creates uncertainty, which makes it more difficult for people to cope.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.5/2">To return to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase> about people with deteriorating conditions, I welcome the concession that the Government made in the Lords. It is important that people with MS, motor neurone disease, Parkinson&#8217;s and so on get ongoing support when they really need it. That is definitely a step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.5/3">I still have some concerns about work incentives and the means test. A person does not get means-tested ESA if their partner has a low level of income. If the partner worked 24 hours a week on the minimum wage, that would be a household income of &#163;145 a week. However, as people would get increased housing benefit, council tax benefit and so on, the drop in income for that household when the sick or disabled person no longer received ESA would be significantly less than the scare stories are leading people to believe. I also appreciate that when universal credit is introduced, that will be far less of an issue, because the income disregard for households in which there is someone with a disability will be set much higher, at &#163;140 a week. In the future, under universal credit, a household with an income of &#163;140 a week will get the whole of their income and the full universal credit on top of that, so this is mainly an issue for the 18 months between the introduction of the policy that we are discussing and the introduction of the universal credit in October 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.5/4">I would be grateful if the Minister, if he gets the chance to sum up at the end of the debate, would say whether anything can be done to bridge that gap. For example, we could look at making sure that people in that category are among the first to be moved on to universal credit, so that we can ensure that the period in which they lose out on income is as short as possible. In addition, the DWP impact assessment says that it is likely to cost &#163;30 million in increased benefit payments as the partners of those affected leave work. I would be grateful if the Minister could consider whether there is anything that could be done to reduce that amount of money by considering the effect on such households.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.5/5">Finally, the debate has been getting quite heated on the subject of young disabled people. I understand that there is a lot of concern about this group, because they are particularly vulnerable, but there has been a good deal of rhetoric&#8212;not least today&#8212;about the Government taking away those individuals&#8217; whole income. We have heard suggestions that people will not get anything at all, but it has been made clear today that the means test will not take into account parents&#8217; income once the disabled or sick young person reaches the age of 18 or 19. Despite the best efforts of those on the Opposition Front Bench to muddy the waters, it is quite clear that the means test will only take into account that individual&#8217;s circumstances. The parents&#8217; savings and income will not be taken into account and that is why nine out of 10 of the people affected will still receive income-related ESA. That is a crucial message for people who are concerned about this move. The vast majority of people will not lose their benefits, despite the negative messages we have heard, which are creating fear that is unnecessary and worrying.</p>

	<p pid="a.850.2/1">This is indeed a grubby and obnoxious measure, but I have no doubt that at 2.30 pm, the Government will carry the day. I sat on the Government Benches for 13 years, and in the unlikely event that my Government had introduced such a measure, I would not have hesitated to vote against it, as I did on other motions on one or two occasions&#8212;although not many. I would not have expected my Government to propose such a measure, and I am pleased that we are opposing it. In essence, we are debating a 12-month limit&#8212;if the Lords amendments are defeated, as I expect they will be&#8212;for those with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses in the work-related activity group of the employment and support allowance. After 12 months, most of them will be means-tested. Some Government Members will ask why such a means tests should not be imposed, but let us be clear, so that when hon. Members vote in half an hour they know what they are voting on: a claimant in the category that I have mentioned whose partner works for more than 24 hours or earns &#163;149 weekly&#8212;&#163;149, not &#163;249 or &#163;549&#8212;could lose all their benefit. I wonder how many Government Members, who seem so keen on the proposal, could justify that in their constituencies. I certainly could not and would not wish to try.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.2/2">As has been stated, Macmillan Cancer Support believes that 7,000 cancer patients will be adversely affected by the proposal. The Government&#8217;s own figures show that 94% of people with cancer who are placed in the group that I have mentioned need ESA for longer than 12 months. That is not disputed&#8212;if it is, the Minister will intervene. I repeat: the Government&#8217;s own statistics show that 94% of such people require that support for longer than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.850.2/3">This is not just about cancer patients. Let me quote a piece written by someone who has a rare bone disease. He is 50 years old and has spent more than three years in hospitals, trying to recover. He is not in a position to take employment, and that is not disputed. He says that he paid national insurance contributions all his life, until his illness, and he gets &#163;89 a week through ESA. He writes that it</p>
	<p pid="a.850.2/4">&#8220;isn&#8217;t a big sum&#8230;but it makes a huge difference for me. Among other everyday essentials it pays for the heating to keep me warm during the long and often painful days at home while my partner is out at work.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.850.2/5">Not an extravagant sum, is it? We are not being over-indulgent to someone who worked until he had that terrible disease and wants to try to make the best of his life in such circumstances. He says&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I hope the Minister is listening&#8212;he smiles.</p>

	<p pid="a.851.0/1">If I understand correctly, the hon.

	<p pid="a.851.1/1">He may well work again, but not at this moment. He writes that when the Welfare Reform Bill becomes law in April he, and others, such as cancer sufferers, people with psychiatric problems and those with other life-threatening illnesses will have their benefits &#8220;stripped&#8221; from them once 12 months is up. If his partner earns the sum I have mentioned of as little as &#163;149 a week and if they have modest savings, he will receive nothing at all once he is means-tested. If that case is an illustration of the Government&#8217;s intentions, there is all the more reason for a reluctance to support the measures and a recognition of what the House of Lords has tried to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.851.1/2">As I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40145" name="Jennifer Willott">the hon. Member for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> and to the Liberal Democrat Minister of State, who intervened on my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>, I asked myself whether, if they were in opposition, they would have the slightest hesitation in upholding the decision of the Lords by majority vote. The answer is pretty obvious. To their credit, a number of Liberal Democrats in the Lords decided to vote against the Government, and Liberal Democrat MPs would, in opposition, have voted in the same Lobby as us at half-past 2. It is unfortunate that they are willing to sacrifice their principles so flagrantly as a result of being in the coalition.</p>
	<p pid="a.851.1/3">Let me end on a quote:</p>
	<p pid="a.851.1/4">&#8220;People who are sick, who are vulnerable&#8230;I want you to know we will always look after you. That&#8217;s the sign of a civilized society and it&#8217;s what I believe.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.851.1/5">That was the Prime Minister at his party conference. What he is now doing with his colleagues and with the support of the Liberal Democrats is hitting out at the most vulnerable people in our society&#8212;cancer patients and the rest, including the man I mentioned. Those are the people who will be penalised financially and harmed in so many ways as a result of what the Government are doing. That is a direct contradiction of what the Prime Minister said about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

	<p pid="a.853.9/1">As I was saying, one in three of us&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Shame!&#8221;] I will start again. One in three of us, sadly, comes into contact with cancer during our lifetime. It is a very difficult situation. I lost both my parents, and my wife lost both of hers, so I understand how sufferers and their relatives and friends are affected. It is not just the disease that has an effect&#8212;there is also the mental and physical stress and traumatisation for people who suffer from diseases such as cancer and stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.9/2">Some of the people who suffer from cancer might not see two years&#8212;they might not have a vision of the next two years on this earth&#8212;but the Government propose to cut benefits from those people at that time in their lives. It is absolutely dreadful that in 2012 we have a Government who are even considering such heinous acts against the most vulnerable. When the Secretary of State, who has left the Chamber, discusses these issues on television and in the media he seems to relish the fact that benefits will be cut. He seems to have a sense of contentment or self-satisfaction&#8212;almost an arrogance beyond belief&#8212;when he states clearly that benefits will be cut. To say the very least, it is gut-wrenching.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.9/3">We as politicians across the board should be looking to defend people whose voices are mostly unheard. They elected us into our positions, and they depend on us. The Government must consider an extension to ESA for two years, and we must exempt those receiving cancer treatments from any time limit whatever. It is breathtaking and incomprehensible that benefits are being cut from people at that critical point in their lives, when some see the possibility that they will not live much longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.9/4">There are regional differences as well, regarding the availability of cancer treatments, for example. The north-east fares very poorly in that. We also have the highest incidence of newly diagnosed cancers, and I am certainly not happy with the cutting of benefits in any way, shape or form to people suffering from cancers, strokes and all those debilitating diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.9/5">In conclusion, we need to give such people a break&#8212;give them a chance and some understanding. You can nod your head all you wish.</p>

	<p pid="a.855.5/1">I will try to keep my comments brief, given the time pressure on us.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/2">The Lords has done us a big service by highlighting the impact and implications of these measures for sick and disabled people. The 12-month limit to contributory ESA is arbitrary. Regardless of the people in the support group, the measure will affect people who are adapting to radical and serious changes in their health, income and life. They might be suffering from life-limiting conditions, long-term disability or fluctuating conditions. They might be people who have been used to living on an average income, but will have to get used to living on a very low income. Those adaptations take time; getting better takes time. Some people will take less than 12 months, some considerably more. Macmillan thinks that 94% will need support in the work-related activity group for more than 12 months. In that respect, while I do not accept the principle of an arbitrary time limit, I suspect that two years would catch more of those people and see them getting the support they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/3">Fundamentally, these measures will upset the contract that we all like to think we have when we pay our national insurance contributions&#8212;that there will be some limited safety net for us if we are unfortunate enough to become sick or disabled. That could happen to any one of us in this Chamber, at any time. We do not</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/4">know when we are going to have an accident or develop a serious illness, so not only cancer is involved, although we know that people across society are affected by it. Other conditions are just as serious, and the same principles apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/5">On insecurity, I should draw an analogy with what happened when banks tried to prey on people&#8217;s insecurities about the future by asking them to take on insurance for loans they had taken out. The banks have had to pay out seven-figure sums in compensation to people who were mis-sold insurance policies. I hope that that does not happen again as people think, &#8220;If I get a serious illness, there will not be support for me.&#8221; I am worried that there will be an opportunity for unscrupulous selling of insurance policies to vulnerable people at the most vulnerable times in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/6">I am concerned about the knock-on impact of the proposals on carers too. In my constituency, I have seen families working longer hours, often in low-paid jobs, just to provide financially for family members who are no longer able to work, but who once were. There is particular concern around young people; that was mentioned earlier in the debate, but it has not been focused on so much. Parents of disabled young adults have often saved throughout their lives as they are concerned about what will happen when they are no longer able to look after their children. They have saved for their children to ensure that they have independent means and a bit of money behind them for when they are adult and their parents are no longer in a position to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/7">It would be unfortunate if the capital of those young people were eroded at a time when they still had some support from their parents. They might be prevented from having an independent old age and might be made more dependent on the state than they would otherwise be. That is about the dignity of young disabled people as much as anything.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/8">I urge the Government to consider the fact that ESA needs to be assessed on the basis of medical need, not an arbitrary time limit. People should get the support they need according to their health, not some arbitrary category that they may or may not fit into.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.856.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" speakername="Sheila Gilmore" colnum="856"  time="014:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0002.htm#12020160003536">
	<p pid="a.856.0/1">What we have heard today is that there is a big divide between the parties on our views of what the welfare state is for. The Minister opened the debate by saying that the welfare state is a safety net, by which he meant a safety net only on financial grounds; those who are very poor get help, but those who are not do not. That is not how I see it. The welfare state was set up to help us through the times when we are in difficulties, including illness and poor health. It is the social security that gives us the confidence that we will be provided for when we need it. This distinction clearly illustrates the divide between the parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.0/2">It was very odd to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40145" name="Jennifer Willott">the hon. Member for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase> argue that this matter was somehow not as important as the Opposition think it is because people will end up in the support group. That goes against everything that many disability organisations are saying, which is that people who have an illness or a disability do want to get back to work. Perhaps they are not quite ready to go back to work within a year, but they do want to work. Parking people in the support group is a very odd solution indeed, because we will end</p>
	<p pid="a.856.0/3">up going back to the situation that the Government have so heavily criticised. Where people have saved, they should have that opportunity. If someone falls ill at that age, they will already have incurred considerable financial losses and no doubt bitten into their savings. We are talking not about welfare, but about people who will start to lose benefits when they have savings of over &#163;6,000 a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.870.0/1">I have received a report from the Tellers in the Division at 10.14 pm yesterday on the Question that new clause 11 be added to the Local Government Finance Bill. The hon. Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb) and for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth) have informed me that the number of No votes was erroneously reported as 309 instead of 299. I will direct the Clerk to correct the numbers in the <i>Journal</i> accordingly. The Ayes were 225 and the Noes were 299, so the verdict is not altered.</p>

	<p pid="a.871.0/1">As Mr Speaker has indicated, Lords amendment 47 impinges on the financial privilege of this House. I ask the House to disagree to it, and I will ask the Reasons Committee to ascribe financial privilege as the reason for doing so. Notwithstanding that, the House has an opportunity to debate the substance of the Lords amendment and I intend to provide the Government&#8217;s full rationale for rejecting it. I will also deal with the matters raised in the amendments tabled by the Opposition and explain why they should be rejected as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.871.0/2">I should like to start by stressing that this debate is not simply about the financial aspects of what we are doing. The fact is that the arguments in favour of a cap are about fairness and about ending a situation in which, for some people, benefit rates are so high that is it not worth working. It is worth my saying that on this issue, the public of this country are overwhelmingly behind us.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.871.1/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend on disagreeing with the Lords on this point. He is absolutely right that the public are right behind us, but does he agree with many of my constituents who think that the cap is still being set too high? They find it incredible that anybody could possibly think that it was too low.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.871.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" speakername="Chris Grayling" colnum="871"  time="014:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0002.htm#12020160005335">
	<p pid="a.871.2/1">Indeed, and what my hon. Friend says makes all the more extraordinary the flip-flopping position that we have seen from the Opposition in the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.871.2/2">A recent YouGov poll showed 76% support for the cap, confirming what all of us will know from our mailbags&#8212;that the vast majority of the general public agree with the Government. It is not just the general public as a whole who agree with us, it is Labour voters as well. More than two thirds of them support the principle of a benefit cap. They agree with us that it is wrong to pay people who do not work more in benefits than people earn on average when they do work.</p>
	<p pid="a.871.2/3">The cap will set a firm upper limit on total benefit entitlement, which for families and lone parents will be equivalent to the average wage for working households. We estimate that to be about &#163;500 a week or &#163;26,000 a year, which is equivalent to gross earnings of &#163;35,000 a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.871.3/1">I would support entirely what the Minister says but for the fact that in my constituency, rents are so high and housing shortages so great that people do not have a choice. They are obliged to rent properties that entitle them to higher housing benefit, which costs more than the cap. That is the fault of landlords for the rents that they charge, not of the poor people who have no choice and will become homeless under the cap provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.871.4/1">The right hon. Lady uses the evocative word &#8220;homeless&#8221;, but what happens to people in her constituency who are bringing up a family and earning a salary of &#163;35,000 a year? Should they pay for those who are not working to have a home at the taxpayer&#8217;s expense?</p>

	<p pid="a.872.0/1">Of course people on lower incomes can receive housing benefit, but I am not aware that it is paid to families earning &#163;35,000 a year. Surely that is the point. We are setting a dividing line.</p>
	<p pid="a.872.0/2">The Opposition say that they agree with the principle of a cap, but they have been an unedifying sight in the past few weeks. Labour has said one thing one day and another the next. Let us take the example of the former Minister and now Opposition spokesman in the House of Lords, Lord McKenzie. On Second Reading, he described the cap as an &#8220;arbitrary measure&#8221;. On Report, however, he said that he was in favour of a benefit cap. Then bizarrely, no doubt at the instigation of the shadow Secretary of State, he tabled an amendment that was officially judged to be a wrecking amendment. When the vote on it was lost, the Opposition decided that they would support the exclusion of child benefit, and the new clause that they tabled effectively stated that they believed &#163;26,000 a year was not enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.872.0/3">Of course, if child benefit were excluded from the cap, a household in work would have to earn a gross salary of around &#163;40,000 a year to receive as much as a household with four children would get in benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.872.1/1">I am sure that my right hon. Friend has seen that, in recent years, a large number of new jobs in this country have gone to people who have recently arrived. They have not seemed to be attractive to people who have been settled here longer and are unemployed. Does he think that is because it is not worth their while, as benefits are too high relative to pay?</p>

	<p pid="a.872.2/1">That is exactly the problem. Many people are taking a hard look at the financial situation and asking, &#8220;Why would I return to work?&#8221; Surely that has to end.</p>

	<p pid="a.872.3/1">Although most of us agree that there should be a cap, does the Minister not accept that the situation is different for people living in different parts of the United Kingdom? Costs are different, so common sense says that the cap should be different.</p>

	<p pid="a.872.4/1">I was going to come on to the Opposition amendments, but I should make the point that, although this debate is not simply about money, there is no getting away from the fact that their amendments would be costly. They would cut the savings that will be generated by &#163;120 million in 2013-14 and &#163;130 million in subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.872.4/2">I have great respect for the hon. Lady, and she makes an important point, but it would be altogether more credible if it had not been made at the very last minute. I do not ascribe the blame to her personally, but what we have heard from the Labour party has been quite extraordinary. Its latest effort, in today&#8217;s amendments, is to propose a regional benefit cap set by an independent body. The Opposition have tabled that idea and want to discuss it. However, did they table it on Second Reading? No. We had an extensive debate in Committee, which included many of the right hon. and hon. Members who are currently in their places, and I have no recollection of any mention of a regional benefit cap. We then had</p>
	<p pid="a.872.4/3">Report, and again I have no recollection of its being mentioned. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State led on Third Reading. I have asked him, and he cannot remember mention of a regional benefit cap. There were then the debates in the House of Lords, in which there was no mention of it. I believe that the first time we heard about it was on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme about 10 days ago. Frankly, it is a proposal designed to get the Opposition off the hook.</p>

	<p pid="a.873.0/1">Can I assume that if the Government accepted the Opposition&#8217;s proposal, the &#163;26,000 cap would apply to London and the south-east and my hon.

	<p pid="a.873.1/1">That may well be the case, but of course it is not clear. We do not quite know what is in the mind of the Labour party. Is it suggesting&#8212;this is not in its amendments&#8212;that the cap should still be set at &#163;26,000, in which case there is no reason why Labour Members should not back our measures? Or do they plan a higher cap in some parts of the country and a lower cap in others, accepting that our benefit system should be regionally based? Frankly, I am completely confused, and the House has every reason to be the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.873.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but that is not a conversation that the shadow Secretary of State will wish to have with his close friends in the trade union movement, who would not approve at all of the idea of beginning to regionalise how the public sector operates.</p>

	<p pid="a.873.4/1">The Minister expressed surprise at the concept of variable caps and benefits.

	<p pid="a.874.3/1">The Minister knows that the Committee extensively discussed the impact of housing costs and their interaction with the cap.

	<p pid="a.874.4/1">I am sorry, but I simply do not buy the homelessness argument that Labour Members keep making. We are talking about a cap equivalent to a salary of &#163;35,000 a year. Labour Members were vociferous 12 months ago when the housing benefit cap was introduced, but we have not seen the consequences of which they warned in the terms they used. I simply do not accept that somebody receiving the equivalent of &#163;35,000 a year should be categorised as homeless and unable to find anywhere to live.</p>
	<p pid="a.874.4/2">Much was said in the other place on the importance of child benefit. Let me make it clear that the introduction of a benefit cap will not result in a single household losing its entitlement to child benefit, which will continue&#8212;rightly&#8212;to be paid to the current recipient. That important principle will not change.</p>
	<p pid="a.874.4/3">We are, however, changing another important principle: households on out-of-work benefits should not in future expect to receive unlimited financial support from the state. Like other welfare benefits, child benefit is funded by taxpayers. We therefore believe that it is right for its value to be taken into account along with other state benefits when applying the cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.875.2/2">The Government have said that there will and should be some exemptions from the cap, but we believe that work should be the primary way in which households can avoid it. We will therefore exempt households that are entitled to working tax credit. There will be a similar exemption after 2013 for working households on universal credit. Excluding child benefit will only dilute our aim. Being in work&#8212;even part-time work&#8212;must always pay better than relying on benefits alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.2/3">We have always acknowledged that there will and should be exemptions from the cap among benefit recipients. Those will be households where someone is in receipt of disability living allowance. We will also exempt war widows and widowers. I can announce today that we intend to exempt the small number of households where someone is in receipt of the support component of employment and support allowance but not in receipt of DLA.</p>
	<p pid="a.875.2/4">We have been clear that we are looking at ways in which to ease the transition for families and to provide assistance in hard cases. That is no different from what we did when we introduced the housing benefit cap a year ago. We used the time before the measure came in to work with those affected; we had flexibilities around the start; and we ensured discretionary funding for local authorities to support hard cases. It is our intention to take the same approach with the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.0/1">My understanding is that those were not the words used by the Secretary of State, but I want to reassure my right hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.0/2">Let me set out in a little more detail how the transitional measures will work. First, those who are affected by the cap will receive and have access to immediate support from Jobcentre Plus and the Work programme, starting from April this year. We know who the families are. We need them to understand how the cap will work and how it will apply to them, because people in receipt of working tax credit will be exempt from the cap. So we have a 12-month period to work intensively with the families concerned to explain what steps they need to take, to provide support through the Work programme and to look for employment opportunities for them, which will address the issue and move them back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.0/3">We also always expected that we would provide a grace period&#8212;a degree of transition&#8212;for people who simply lose their jobs and find that their circumstances have changed dramatically through no fault of their own. We will not penalise those who are in work and doing the right thing. We will put in place a nine-month grace period for those who have been in work for the previous 12 months and lose their job through no fault of their own. We have always intended to make this measure, and I am happy to make that clear to the House today.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.0/4">In addition, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have made it clear that we will provide transitional support to help manage families into more appropriate accommodation&#8212;as we did when we introduced the housing benefit cap. So we will follow the same model of additional money for discretionary housing payments that we adopted for the introduction of the housing benefit cap last year. We will ensure that resources are available in the right areas, such as London, where a larger proportion will be affected. We will provide short-term, temporary relief to families who may face a variety of challenges, such as not being able to move immediately for reasons of education or child protection, supporting minimum levels of access to the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.0/5">We will provide up to &#163;80 million for this purpose in 2013-14, and a further &#163;50 million in 2014-15. However, we intend to work extensively with these families over the next 12 months. It is not our expectation that we will need anything like that amount of money, but it is there and available to ensure that we can provide appropriate transitional support for those who may require it.</p>

	<p pid="a.877.2/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is simply out of touch with the reality of what is happening in our country. He talks about the impact of the cap on children. But children are already having their life chances and opportunities damaged by growing up in households and communities in which no one is working. That is what we are seeking to change. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, said last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.877.2/2">&#8220;If we cannot make the rewards of hard work more appealing than a life spent on the dole then we will have failed a generation of children.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.877.2/3">That is the reality that we face today and it is why we seek to change the way in which our welfare state operates. The Government clearly have the support of the British people on the cap. If we do not reject the Lords amendment, the public will not understand why. This is a reform that is long overdue and the Government are determined to deliver it.</p>

Frankly, little progress was made in tackling that problem during the 1980s and the 1990s, which was why the institution of tax credits under Labour was such an important part of our welfare reform. Together with the national minimum wage, it ensured that people were better off in work. It was wise, therefore, for the Government to accept the principle of tax credits in their proposed changes to universal credit. That, too, is a principle that we support, and it is why we are in favour of a benefit cap, but we would like one that does not backfire and one that works in practice.

	<p pid="a.880.0/1">My hon. Friend did an extraordinary job of deconstructing the Bill as it went through Committee, and she is an acknowledged expert on this subject. Her point is absolutely right. The Minister was not able to confirm that somebody on &#163;35,000 could receive, for example, housing benefit. I am reliably informed that that is, in fact, the case. Because the Government have not thought this measure through, we are now confronted with the extraordinary spectacle of a cap that appears to cost more than it saves. As was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>, who is not in his place now, in some parts of the country that will not send the signal that people are better off in work than on benefits. Only the Government could have introduced a proposal that is, frankly, that much of a dog&#8217;s breakfast.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/2">Let us take the cost side first. In this debate, we are in the happy position of not simply having to rely on costing an assertion made by Opposition Members. We are very grateful that we have got the analysis that was presented by our good friend, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. In a blunt warning&#8212;not just to anybody, but to the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office&#8212;the principal private secretary in the Department for Communities and Local Government said:</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/3">&#8220;we think it is likely that the policy as it stands will generate a net cost&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/4">and that was before the Government burnt all the money that they have put up in smoke just this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/5">A cursory glance at some of the scenarios that we will see in, for example, the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the hon.

	<p pid="a.880.4/1">I will give way in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.4/2">Let us just see what that scenario looks like in London. The House of Commons Library tells us that a family in that situation will be taking a hundred quid in jobseeker&#8217;s allowance, &#163;74 in child benefit, &#163;255 in child tax credit, &#163;32 in council tax benefit and&#8212;because of the high levels of rents in London&#8212;&#163;350 in housing benefit. Under the cap, a family in that position will lose about &#163;243. There is no way on earth that their rent will</p>
	<p pid="a.880.4/3">fall by that amount. Even out of London, a family in that situation will face losing &#163;87 a week, and there is no way that their rent will fall by that amount either. Those families&#8212;some 21,000 of them&#8212;will be made homeless. Coincidentally, that is exactly the figure in the analysis produced by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. I am afraid that it is therefore rather ludicrous to suggest that there will not be widespread homelessness as a result of the &#8220;one cap fits all&#8221; approach, and if anyone wanted any proof of that, the Minister has just given it by telling us that he has had to burn a third of the savings that he proposes to make in sorting the problem out.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making a powerful case. Does he recall that, when the housing benefit capping measures were introduced, the Government said that rents would be likely to go down? What would he say to my constituent, a higher executive officer with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, whose landlord has put her rent up by &#163;100 from <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-12">12 January</phrase>?

	<p pid="a.881.1/1">My hon. Friend has highlighted a problem with which we are confronted in London and elsewhere. It was remarkable that the Minister managed to get through his speech this afternoon without making any reference to the latest DCLG estimates for how much rents in London and elsewhere are going to rise. According to some analyses that I have seen, they could rise by something like 41% over the next few years. Nowhere is that corrected or remedied in the Government&#8217;s proposals. One Department is simply not talking to the other.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.2/1">Has the shadow Minister not just illustrated that this is a Greater London-centric issue, given that 60% of the high claims and high benefit payments are in the Greater London area? Across Northern Ireland, only one claimant is in receipt of an amount that would reflect a higher benefit. Yes, something needs to be said about London, but this issue does not affect the whole of the UK in the same way.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is making the point that we tried to make in our amendment&#8212;namely, that a &#8220;one cap fits all&#8221; proposal does not look as though it is going to work. We have heard the Minister&#8217;s reassurances this afternoon that certain families will be referred into the Work programme, but I am afraid that the Work programme is failing. The off-flow rate&#8212;the rate at which people flow off benefits and into work&#8212;in the last quarter of last year was the lowest since 1998. People are not getting back into work, because the Government&#8217;s back-to-work programmes are failing. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he is going to do about that problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.4/1">I have two questions for the right hon. Gentleman, to which I would appreciate simple answers. First, as there are not yet any statistics to demonstrate how the Work programme is working, how can he make assertions about it? He does not know, one way or the other. Secondly, as he is skating round this</p>
	<p pid="a.881.4/2">issue in a big way this afternoon, will he tell us whether he supports the principle of a &#163;26,000 a year benefit cap in London? Yes or no?</p>

	<p pid="a.882.0/1">As I have rehearsed this afternoon, we simply think that a &#8220;one cap fits all&#8221; approach is not going to work. The Minister has had to put his hand in his pocket and spend a fortune to fix the problem. He tells us that the Work programme is working well, but the rate at which people are flowing off benefits and into work speaks for itself. It is at its lowest point since 1998. That tells us, I am afraid, that the back-to-work programmes are simply not going to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.882.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman says that some people will have to move home. Why does he think that that is unacceptable for the long-term unemployed? Every day, people&#8217;s circumstances change. They might lose their job, their marriage or their relationship, and those circumstances mean that they have to move home. Why should the long-term&#8212;often third generation&#8212;unemployed be exempt from the real world that so many people live in?</p>

	<p pid="a.882.2/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for making that point with such force. No one is against people having to move home or to lower-cost areas of accommodation. What people are worried about is 21,000 families being made homeless, local councils having to pick up the bill for that, and that bill having to be paid for by council tax payers such as hers. What conversations has she had with her constituents about how much their council tax bill is going to go up because there is a new bill for homelessness to pay?</p>

	<p pid="a.882.3/1">I can assure the right hon. Gentleman, following conversations with my constituents in Broxtowe, that hard-working people overwhelmingly take the view that the long-term unemployed should no longer be better off on benefit than in work. That is not only for the sake of the public purse; it is a result of the compassion that we feel&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i> Hon. Members should not laugh; they should know better. In the real world, some of the people I used to represent as a criminal barrister were third-generation unemployed. It is for the sake of them and their children that they should be back in work, and that is what these measures have at their heart.</p>

When they are told to move, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase> suggests, there is nowhere for them to move to. Our constituents are being told to move to outer boroughs, but Conservative Members know perfectly well that moving to Croydon, Bexley or Bromley is no solution for people who live in Lewisham, where rents are lower. Let me make a further point. I am told on good authority that Croydon, where it is suggested my constituents could move, is now looking to towns in the north of England to house its homeless.</p>

It was such a big feature of the benefit system that in 1942 William Beveridge devoted an entire section of his report to &#8220;the problem of rents&#8221;, as he put it.

	<p pid="a.884.0/1">I shall come on to that directly, but I agree with the hon. Lady on one important point. It is important to take local factors into account. If we take out the pension system, the housing benefit bill is something like a quarter of the overall benefits spending. It has been localised for something like 70 years. Admitting a degree of localisation in the way we set a cap sounds as though it could be perfectly consistent with her proposals, although I have not read her pamphlet.</p>
	<p pid="a.884.0/2">Let me give the House one more illustration of why this is so important. Perhaps the problem of the five-child family in London is included in the hon. Lady&#8217;s pamphlet. Almost half the benefits received by that family will consist of housing benefit, as opposed to only about a third of the benefits received by a family in similar circumstances living in a different part of the country. Pretty often, incidentally, that money goes to the landlord rather than the family in question. I believe that we should have a cap that is different in different parts of the country, but takes account of differences in housing benefit.</p>

As has been pointed out by many Members representing all parts of the United Kingdom, the cap that the Government propose may not send people the signal that they are better off in work. Our argument is in our amendment, which says that the cap should reflect differences in housing benefit costs in different parts of the country. That has always been an element of our benefits system, but we would add a couple of extra safeguards. There should be a safeguard against homelessness and the kind of costs that the Minister has had to fix this afternoon, and&#8212;in my view&#8212;there should also be a safeguard against child poverty. Heaven knows, that is worsening enough under the present Government., and we do not want it to become worse still.</p>

That is why we suggest that principle, and why we suggest that an independent commission looks at the levels. We have seen the muddle that the Government have got into&#8212;a muddle that has cost the Exchequer &#163;80 million this year, and will cost it &#163;50 million in the year after that; that is the cost of sorting out the homelessness that it has, over the past year, been telling the House would not arise. If the Government tried to take politics out of the issue just for a moment, and focused on the good old-fashioned business of getting the policy right, they might be in a better position to put in place a cap that does not backfire.</p>

	<p pid="a.886.0/1">That brings me to the final point that I want to make, which is about how the policy will be implemented. We are pleased that the Government will take on half of our amendment and introduce a grace period. The Secretary of State has made it clear, from a sedentary position, that the cap is not intended to apply to those who are in work, but we are still not completely clear about how many hours a week someone will have to work to secure that exemption. I understood, in Committee, that someone needed to be working at least 24 hours a week on the minimum wage for that to happen, but the whole thrust of universal credit is to ensure, and to encourage people to take, mini-jobs. If someone is working five, six or seven hours a week, would they, too, be exempt from the benefit cap?</p>
	<p pid="a.886.0/2">Finally, what would happen if a partner left their spouse, and that spouse, who had four children and lived in a constituency or neighbourhood across the river, automatically found themselves in receipt of benefits that were above the cap? In that tragic situation of family break-up, what happens to the parent looking after the children? Those are important transitional issues that I hope the Minister can clarify.</p>

	<p pid="a.886.5/1">The Minister with responsibility for pensions asks what we did about it; again, in the Conservative party&#8217;s briefing for today&#8217;s debate, there are some interesting figures about the rise in housing benefit over the past few years, but of course closer inspection of the DWP forecast for the next few years shows that housing benefit is set to rise, year on year, at the same rate as in the past 13 years.

	<p pid="a.887.0/1">This is rightly difficult territory. I am relieved to hear that Ministers have reconsidered the transitional arrangements, and I am pleased that the Opposition welcome that. In the noise and heat of the debate, important truths are getting lost or ignored. We are not generous enough towards the disabled, and I was pleased to hear that they are completely exempted from the proposals, which should be widely welcomed across the House. The exemption of war widows, who often have very little to live on and whose former husbands sacrificed so much to help our country, is extremely welcome, as both parties in government have asked their loved ones to go into battle on our behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.0/2">I am also pleased to hear that anybody in work is exempted. The Government&#8217;s case revolves around something with which I believe the Labour party normally agrees: working should always be worth while. In today&#8217;s debate, there has been more heat than light. If the Labour party, the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrat party all believe that it should be more worth while to work, we need such a provision to achieve the desired effect. It comes down to the last-minute proposal that there should be some regional differentiation of the cap. We are no longer arguing for or against caps&#8212;we all now believe in that type of headgear&#8212;but Labour believes that there should be different fashions of cap across the country whereas, on the Government Benches, the passion is apparently for uniform caps.</p>

We have the conundrum, however, that we always want to make it worth while for those people to work. We all accept that there will be a cap, but, if it is to be a regional cap, before deviating from the Government&#8217;s proposal to the Labour proposal we would need to know what Labour has in mind for the total costings and how the proposal would work fairly within an area as well as between areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.888.0/1">One thing that the right hon. Gentleman has not mentioned is that when we compare the working family with the non-working family, all too often in this debate we are not comparing apples with apples. The working family would have child benefit for their children on top of the wage that is constantly mentioned and, depending on the number of children they have, they might well qualify for child tax credit. We are not comparing properly, so simply saying that the situation is unfair to those working families gives the wrong impression. Does he not agree?</p>

	<p pid="a.888.1/1">I thought it was now common ground that for a large number of people on certain kinds of benefit, work is not worth while. We are trying to solve that problem, so despite all those things that the hon. Lady truthfully reports to the House, we still have that problem, with which both parties are wrestling. That is why the Labour party is not here today saying, &#8220;There is no problem: we are going to vote against the whole thing,&#8221; but is here with an alternative proposal at the 11th hour&#8212;the last possible chance to consider this.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.1/2">Let us go back to Labour&#8217;s argument on the regional cap. If it had come with a properly costed and working proposal, I might have been sympathetic to it, but we do not yet know from Labour what is the total package of money available. We have not even been told whether it wants to live within the budget that the Government have come up with for the proposal or whether it thinks the overall proposal is too mean. If it wants to spend much more, it will not solve the &#8220;Why work?&#8221; problem because provision will become too generous again and it will have a public spending problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.888.2/1">Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us what the budget actually is because although we have heard some figures from the Minister today, he has not set out, for example, whether the grace period will cost any money?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.888.3/1">Ministers are very capable of setting out their own figures. I do not have, at the top of my mind, all the detailed figures the right hon. Gentleman wants, which are properly things for Ministers to report to the House, but they have detailed the total savings overall and they are trying to live within that budget. As has rightfully been reported to the House today, they have given up some of the savings to accommodate the transitional period. It is entirely fair to ask the right hon. Gentleman, who is a specialist, as is the Minister he shadows, to tell us how much difference there would be in his proposals. Clearly, Labour has not yet thought through what the total should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.3/2">There is another, very difficult, issue to consider with regionalism: there are big divergences in house and flat prices within, as well as between, regions. We should recognise this point, which in some ways makes this policy a bit easier to stomach than some on the Labour Benches suggest. I heard a former Westminster councillor saying that she had done some work on the situation of families who would be caught by the cap in Westminster. Naturally I was worried and wanted to hear what her answer was. She said she had found a considerable number of properties that she thought would be suitable for those families, quite close to where they were currently living, which happened to be rather better value than those in which they were currently living, supported by benefits. That seemed rather good news to me. Members from London constituencies will know that within London there is a huge variety of cost in property&#8212;often street by street, not merely borough by borough&#8212;so I do not think the proposal is quite as penal as some on the Labour Benches suggest. That makes it quite difficult to set a regional cap because such a cap might be no more appropriate as an average than the national cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.889.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for making this point, which a number of Opposition Members from Northern Ireland have concerns about. I represent a Belfast constituency and there are massive disparities between rents in the Greater Belfast area and those in more rural constituencies. If this sort of regionalisation was driven down to a very local level, it could distort people&#8217;s ability to seek work in the city or outside it.</p>

	<p pid="a.889.1/2">I am conscious that others want to speak so I shall not extend my argument further.

That is an important consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.889.2/1">Presumably, the fact that homelessness will not be created, which is what the Secretary of State has argued over the past year, is the reason why he has had to find another &#163;80 million&#8212;to solve a problem that does not exist. In direct answer to the challenge put by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>, our amendment suggests that the right place to start this debate is by having a level for London and a level for outside London.

	<p pid="a.889.3/1">That is something we need to think rather more about, but unfortunately we have little time to do so. That suggestion might have been helpful, but there is also the problem of the big variety of levels within London. We need to know the extent to which the Labour party wants to validate the current high rents and whether there might be some other solution to the problem of very high rents that lies behind some of this difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.3/2">The conclusion I must come to is that the best offer on this issue at this late stage is the Government&#8217;s. Something must be done to move things in the right direction and make it more worth while to work. All of us, on both sides of the House, are extremely concerned that in recent years, under both parties, although quite a lot of jobs have been generated a very large proportion of them have gone to people who have recently arrived, because they think the jobs are good enough and that the pay is high enough. There have been reasons&#8212;perhaps very good reasons&#8212;why people who are settled here and out of work have not wanted those jobs or been able to take them, but part of the answer must be that we have the wrong balance between benefit and work income, and we need to do something about that.</p>

	<p pid="a.890.0/1">If I may, I shall make one comment on the previous contribution. I thought that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> was going to go a stage further: might there not be a connection between the number of newcomers coming here to work and the extraordinary rise in rents in some parts of the country? That also needs to be introduced to our debate today: we cannot run a welfare policy if we have an open-door policy as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/2">Those on the Treasury Bench are having, they think, a good day, but if they look behind them they will see that all their supporters are newcomers to the House returned at the last election, except for two Members. There is no reason why those supporters, who have been enjoying themselves so much today, should know where we will be this time next year, or a little later. Some time next year, the Bill and, we are told, universal credit will come into operation. It might be that when those two things hit the tarmac Government Members will hope that Opposition Members show a little more foresight and consideration for those on the Treasury Bench than Government Members have shown this afternoon. My guess is that there will be two God-almighty catastrophes hitting this country. The constituents of Government Members will be at their surgeries and Government Members will be baying for blood. The tables turn in this game.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/3">I want to make three quick points, if I may. I say to those on the Treasury Bench that I do not have their confidence that these measures will be implemented smoothly, neither universal credit nor the proposals before us. A lot of people will be in transition. Whatever the arrangements, there will be hurt, and they will make that hurt felt in the constituencies of Government Members, as well as in our constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.890.2/1">If my hon. Friend does not mind, I am going to be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/2">On the insurance principle, those on the Treasury Bench prayed in aid the public being behind them on the measure. Indeed, the public are behind them on that, but the public are against them on the first group of amendments, which we pushed through. Obviously, the Treasury gave a total that the Department for Work and Pensions had to save from the benefits bill. The truth is that we will never get past the stage of picking</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/3">on weaker people until we are prepared also to look at stronger people. Why is it that, somehow, the benefits of people in my position&#8212;those who are part of the baby boom who have done really well out of this country over the years&#8212;are never looked at? Why are we frightened to look at the concessions that, for example, people over retirement age receive as universal benefits?</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/4">If we are not to go down this track again&#8212;the biggest growth in the budget over the past 20 years is in the transfer payments that we are, in effect, discussing today&#8212;we must be a little braver and much more open about those areas that we think should be questioned, rather than having a diet of the sort that has been served up to us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/5">On the &#163;26,000 a year cap, are there not lessons for Members on both sides of the House to learn? One is that the Government&#8217;s proposals are unbelievably crude. I hope that they will adopt our proposals before they go much further in this reform programme. To my own side, I say that I do not want people to think that it is only out in the sticks that people think &#163;26,000 is a high cap. People in London who work think 26 k is high.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/6">We should not make policy because odd people have talked to us in the street, but yesterday, a couple of blocks from here in Strutton Ground, a window cleaner said to me, &#8220;Frank, I start at 4 o&#8217;clock in the morning. I wish I could get a guaranteed &#163;26,000 for my efforts.&#8221; There are lessons for both those on the Treasury Bench and the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/7">My final point has already been made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, who probably knew that I was going to make it and so has disappeared. We have had a nationwide housing benefit for more years than I can remember, and one lesson I have drawn is that landlords are very clever at turning whatever we think of as a cap into a floor. Obviously we want to meet people&#8217;s rents where possible, although they do not have a right in the long run to live somewhere irrespective of what the rent is, but can we run a housing benefit system while having a free market in rents? My suggestion, drawn from the decades I have been in this House, is that the two are incompatible if we are trying to protect taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.2/8">I hope that those three points have been useful. Given that in a year&#8217;s time those on the Treasury Bench will want some sympathy from us when they are operating these measures, it might be rather gracious if they looked more favourably on the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" name="Liam Byrne">the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase>, which would make their reforms better rather than worse.</p>

	<p pid="a.891.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, who always provides the House with a thoughtful contribution. It is important to state that the number of newly elected Government Members shows that we were elected on a promise to get to grips with the welfare state. I represent a constituency where the average wage is very low, yet the jobs created there over the past few years have been taken predominantly by hard-working people from eastern Europe. I think that there is something completely wrong with the system if I can meet people on the streets in Llandudno and Llanddulas who tell me that they are better off not taking employment. There is</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/2">a passion for these changes on the Government Benches, a passion for change that will allow people to do the right thing with their lives and take a job.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/3">I am intrigued and disappointed to see that not a single Labour Member from Wales is in the Chamber to discuss this issue, and I think that I know why. It is because time and again Government Members have asked the shadow Secretary of State to tell us whether his proposed regional cap is for an increase in London, with no change in the rest of the country, or for a reduction in other parts of the country. I do not know a single Labour Assembly Member, councillor or MP who has advocated a lower cap in Wales than in the rest of the country, so it is pretty clear to me that the concept of a regional variation is based on increases in expensive parts of the country but no reductions elsewhere. The Labour party has provided no financial information on its proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/4">I am all in favour of debate on this issue. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> made the point extremely well that there is an argument to be had about the regional variation in pay and benefits, but it is completely unacceptable for the Opposition to turn up with a proposal that is uncosted, untested and, in my view, intended to get the Labour party off the hook rather than contribute to any change. I do not consider myself to be a cynic on this matter, but I wonder why, when the Chancellor highlighted in the autumn statement the possibility of looking at regional pay, the Labour party attacked the proposal, yet it is now looking at proposals for a regional cap, as logically a regional benefit system must follow. I can only conclude that the difference is that benefit recipients are not union members, but public sector workers are.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.0/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman felt the need to add that rejoinder. There is already a very localised dimension to the benefits system: housing benefit. We have had a localised housing benefits system for about 70 years, and that is why the amendment states that, if we are to have a different solution for London, compared with the rest of the country, it is housing benefit differences that should be taken into account if an independent commission is appointed to set the cap levels. We already have that in place in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.1/1">That is an interesting comment. The right hon. Gentleman almost implies that there are no differences between housing costs in other parts of the country. In Wales there are certainly huge differences, for example between Cardiff and north Wales. In my constituency, there has been growth in the population of young people in villages such as Penmaenmawr and Penmachno, and it has been driven by young people who are working but cannot afford to live in the most prosperous areas. They have moved into areas where it is cheaper to buy because that is what they can afford. Why are people who do work and do take responsibility expected to commute to own a house, while that is not the case for somebody who is in receipt of housing benefit? That is another challenge to which we need to respond.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.2/1">May I ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question? Does he not get the fact that people who work are also in receipt of housing benefit? Instead, he is trying to put everybody into the same hole of being workshy and wanting to claim benefits?</p>

	<p pid="a.893.0/1">I reiterate the point that my Front Benchers have made: there are not many people in my constituency earning &#163;35,000 a year before tax who are in receipt of housing benefit. That is the crucial difference. The average wage in my constituency is &#163;23,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.0/2">People say, &#8220;Are we in touch with the general public?&#8221; When I was appointed to the Bill Committee on this proposal, I held three public meetings in my constituency, and one message came through loud and clear: &#8220;Why on earth are you going to put in a cap of &#163;26,000?&#8221; I think that the cap can be justified, because the Government are taking into account the needs of people throughout the country, not just those in my constituency and those in a low-wage economy such as Wales&#8212;a low-wage economy, dare I say it, that has suffered badly from continued Labour party rule for the past 80 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.0/3">The big issue is that we are bringing forward a proposal. If the Opposition were serious, they would also bring forward costed proposals, but we do not have that. We have platitudes and excuses to try for tactical purposes to defend the party position. Ultimately, in this measure, we are proposing a benefits cap, trying to ensure that people see that work does pay and protecting the disabled and people who are in work, and this proposal, in the absence of anything else from the Opposition, is a proposal that we should support.</p>

	<p pid="a.893.1/1">May I just make it clear that I oppose a benefit cap in principle? This policy has been borne out of prejudice and political expediency, rather than reason. In every recession there are scapegoats, and it is usually the poor, who become a political football for political game-playing and advantage. I am not morally willing to involve myself in that debasing political game.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/2">We all have to bring our own experiences of our constituents to this debate, which has exposed differences in their lifestyles, and at times it has been apparent that we do live in different worlds. I do not begrudge Members and their constituents who are in good, well-paid employment, in a secure home that they can afford and in a decent environment, but that is not the experience of many of my constituents, or of many constituents throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/3">I have lived in my constituency for about 35 years, and I live in statistically the most deprived ward in the borough. The vast majority of people whom I see around me desperately want to do what is needed to ensure that their families have a good quality of life. They pay back into the community in many ways, they work long hours often in insecure employment and their pay, in many instances, is low and often below the London living wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/4">The risk is unemployment, which over recent years in my constituency has increased by 52%, and over the past year by 7%, so there will be times when many of my constituents will not be able to find work. They struggle, above all else, just to provide a decent roof over their family&#8217;s heads, and that is because we face the worst housing crisis since the second world war. Housing supply has not kept up with housing demand, council houses that were sold off in the 1980s and &#8217;90s have not been replaced by successive Governments, and there has been an expansion in buy-to-let, higher-rent-charging landlords, who provide many of my constituents</p>

	<p pid="a.894.1/1">Some Members will have seen recent television programmes that relate to my constituents and to Rachmanite landlords. It has not happened overnight; I blame what has happened over the past 30 years. So what is the logic of the cap for my constituents. Is it an incentive to secure work? The vast majority need no incentive; they are desperate for work. Yes, there is a small minority who will always refuse to seek work, but there are already sanctions for that, introduced by this and the last Government. I already have constituents turning up at my surgery who have been automatically suspended from benefits for three months for the slightest infringement, and they include many who suffer mental health problems or who simply cannot work through the system themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.1/2">Is the idea to force people to move to cheaper accommodation? Most in my area pay the rents that they pay because they have no other option; there is nothing to downsize to. In any case, the new housing benefit regulations to force down rents have already been introduced. Benefits in my area already do not meet the full cost of rents. People are faced with options. How do they make up the gap between the benefit and the rent? In some instances this winter, there has been a choice between heating and eating.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.1/3">I repeat that in my constituency&#8212;and this is happening across the country&#8212;we now distribute food parcels to keep people in some form of civilised existence. If people are to move, where do they move to? My local council is advising people to move to Leicester, Southampton, Manchester and elsewhere in the north. The problem is that the lower-rent areas are where there are no jobs. We are in a vicious cycle of forcing people into areas where they cannot survive.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.1/4">For me, the cap simply means that more of my constituents will be forced into poverty. All the statistics demonstrate that children will be hardest hit. There is already the problem of children in families being churned from temporary accommodation to temporary accommodation. That destabilises the family and has an impact on their education. The cap is supposed to control costs, but, as has been said time and again, we simply need to control rents. Halt the profiteering by landlords that has gone on in recent decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.1/5">My view is simply that the cap is unnecessary and based on prejudice and political posturing. In past debates in the House, there have also been discussions about cutting the cost of welfare. There was one quote about benefits being an incitement to idleness. Such expressions were used in the debates about the poor law and eventually led to policies of less eligibility and the workhouse. We do not seem to have learned anything in two centuries about poverty and how to tackle it.</p>

	<p pid="a.894.2/1">I have made clear my view on the total benefits cap a number of times already in the House, but I take this opportunity to highlight again that</p>
	<p pid="a.894.2/2">Liberal Democrat Members support the principle of a cap and the important message that it sends out that it has to be better for people to be in work than on benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.2/3">It is also important to exempt those in the support group of employment and support allowance and those who receive disability living allowance. We do not expect those people to work and it would be inappropriate to apply a cap to them, so I welcome the move announced earlier today. I also welcome the package of transitional measures that the Government have announced&#8212;in particular, the grace period to protect those who fall out of work. The Government&#8217;s grace period of nine months, announced today, is more generous than the six-month period that Labour proposed and was discussed in the other place. I believe that nine months is the right period of time to allow people a chance to get back into work. The vast majority of people who fall out of work will get back into work within that period, so the provision is fair both to families and to taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.894.2/4">During the debate on the cap in recent months, there has been a lot of rhetoric about huge families sponging off the state. I have sympathy with some of the points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. Some of that rhetoric has been extremely unhelpful. Suggestions that all those on out-of-work benefits are getting more than people in work are simply not true. The rhetoric has been ramped up a little and that has been unhelpful for getting to the truth.</p>

	<p pid="a.895.5/2">As has been highlighted by many Members, the cap will hit people hardest in areas with high housing costs. Those tend to be in London, but are also found in cities</p>
	<p pid="a.895.5/3">around the UK. We are not talking about feckless, workshy families with hundreds of children who are sponging off the state. That is why what the Government have put forward today is much more sensible than the proposal sent down from the other place. Exempting child benefit would help those on the margins, but do nothing for those affected by the highest housing costs, who will potentially be most affected by the cap. The Government&#8217;s package of targeted support and discretionary housing payments is a much more effective way to deal with the issues that will be created.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.5/4">I note that Labour Members have not tried to argue otherwise today.

Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase> will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that I heard him say that the Opposition plan to vote against the Government on the motion to disagree, as well as to vote in favour of their own amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.895.5/5">I disagree strongly with the localisation of the benefit cap because that would create a hideously complicated system that it would cost a fortune to implement. It has been suggested in desperation by the Labour party at the very last minute.

	<p pid="a.896.1/3">As other hon. Members have said, alongside the targeted support and the grace period, we need to look at the issue of rents and the ridiculously high housing costs in parts of the country. That affects working families who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, as well as those who are on out-of-work benefits. The Government have been forced into a number of the measures that they are taking because high housing costs have forced up housing benefit and local housing allowance budgets over the past few years. That money is going mainly into the pockets of private landlords. Alongside the transitional support, which will help with high housing costs and help families in the greatest need, I hope that Ministers will work with the Department for Communities and Local Government and local authorities to bring down rents in high-cost areas. That would be a much more effective way to tackle this problem in the long term in particular areas and would save the Government money in the long run.</p>
	<p pid="a.896.1/4">Finally, I am grateful that Ministers have now made it clear that the Government will review the implementation of the cap after a year. I welcome that. I hope that it will identify any issues or areas where there are problems so that action can be taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.897.3/1">This is how the benefit system works in high-rent areas. If someone with four children goes to Hammersmith council and asks to be placed, they will not be given a permanent home and will be told that they have no prospect of ever getting one, because Hammersmith council is demolishing, not building, social housing. They will not even get temporary accommodation. They will be put in a direct let property under the relationship that the council has with some of the seediest landlords going. They will be charged market rents, but will be living in appalling conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.3/2">Let us take a real example of a family with four children who live in an ex-council property&#8212;these slum landlords go around buying up such properties&#8212;on a council estate in the poorest ward in my constituency. They currently get &#163;450 a week in housing benefit for a four-bedroom flat. That will of course be reduced to &#163;400, so they will slowly but surely get to the point of being evicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.3/3">On the day when they are evicted, those people will go back to the town hall with their children. They may then be accepted as non-intentionally homeless, and they might be put into accommodation in Croydon. However, Croydon council says that when the overall cap comes into effect, it will move its families to Hull. That family will therefore face the prospect of a double move.</p>

	<p pid="a.898.0/3">I have done some research on average earnings in my constituency. The figures are not complete, but I think it will be of interest to Members, and relevant to their own constituencies, that of some 20,000 public sector workers in Gloucester, I estimate that 90% have pre-tax salaries of less than the &#163;35,000 that is equivalent to the &#163;26,000 benefit cap that the Government propose. That figure of 90% means that 18,000 people working in my constituency of 100,000 people are in that position</p>
	<p pid="a.898.0/4">It is harder to get the same figures for people working in the private sector, but based on a straw poll of three companies employing more than 400 workers, I estimate that some 87% are on pre-tax salaries of less than &#163;35,000 a year. I believe that the vast majority of workers in my constituency would be astonished that Labour proposes that there should be no cap on the benefits that people get.</p>

	<p pid="a.899.1/1">The hon. Lady is welcome to visit Gloucester. We have lots of things to show her that she will enjoy. If her point was that there are specific problems in London, I agree with her, but I shall come to that later if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.899.1/2">The second group of people in my constituency whom I want to address is those on the lowest wages of all. The Government have been clear that one of their major goals&#8212;many of us campaigned for this long before the general election&#8212;is to reduce, and if possible to eliminate, income tax for the lowest earners in our constituencies. They have done a great deal towards that goal&#8212;I believe that 1.1 million have been taken out of income tax altogether. What message do we send to those who are not earning very much and whom we would like to take out of income tax altogether if we do not cap the benefits that those not in work can clock up?</p>
	<p pid="a.899.1/3">We should send the lowest earners the message that this Government are on their side. We want to take them out of income tax when we can, and at the same time, we want to put a cap on those families who, for whatever reasons, are unemployed. That is a very important message to send, for example, to the young worker at Asda in Barton and Tredworth, who finds that the presents she buys her children at Christmas are not nearly as good as those bought for the children of the family next door, who are living more comfortably on benefits. This is a worker-friendly policy and Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.899.1/4">The third group in my constituency whom I should like to address is those who are the most worried and the most vulnerable, including the disabled&#8212;I have had several mails from disabled people&#8212;war widows and those on PIP or attendance allowances. As the Minister has made absolutely clear, the Bill provides protection for the most vulnerable in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.899.1/5">I absolutely recognise that people could well be affected by some elements of the Bill, and the vast majority of them probably live in London. It is not for me to speak on their behalf or on that issue, but the Minister has addressed the problem with three measures: first, the 10-month grace period; secondly, a special nine-month grace period for those who lose their job; and thirdly, a package of discretionary funding. That seems to me to be a significant proposal for hon. Members whose constituencies are likely to be affected.</p>

Many Government Members, including me, are new to the House and indeed to the world of politics, whereas he has years of experience. I do not have his experience of debating measures that sound great on the day but do not deliver quite what they intended, but in 2010, the Select Committee on</p>

There were warnings from well-known charities such as Shelter and speeches from Opposition Members such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40655" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck)</phrase> that thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people would be thrown out of their accommodation and have to sleep rough on the streets. A year later, none of that has come to pass, although I may have missed something.</p>

	<p pid="a.900.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. I have heard from many charities, whose work I deeply respect in many ways and who are active in my constituency, and the strength of their words on some of these issues does amount to scaremongering. I hope that, as on housing benefit, they are proved entirely wrong.</p>

I have no doubt that were he to go more deeply into the private sector, as I believe he is starting to do, he would be a fantastic salesman of unsellable products. Today, we have heard from him an extraordinary, last-minute and uncosted proposal that leaves us none the wiser about what the Opposition really believe. I sympathise with the right hon. Gentleman. He said that if we left matters to politicians, they would make a pig&#8217;s ear of it. He is right: he did. From the man who was in charge of the spending of taxpayers&#8217; money and realised that he had spent it all, that was a hugely motivational factor for many Government Members, who realised that politicians had made a pig&#8217;s ear of it and perhaps it was time for people from outside politics to come in and try to do something to help.</p>

	<p pid="a.900.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is very generous and I am grateful for his compliments. But he must accept that Ministers have so badly thought this policy through that they have had to face the indignity of coming to this House and promising to spend &#163;130 million solving a problem that they have told us for the last year would never present itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.900.3/1">As the right hon. Gentleman will have just heard, I came into this House from outside politics, with a background in the public sector, the charity sector and business, where making concessions and being flexible in achieving goals was generally considered to be a merit. Perhaps if he had shown more flexibility in his approach to the handling of taxpayers&#8217; funds, we would not be in quite the situation that we are today. I am sorry, because I enjoy his company, but I came to the conclusion that his approach today does not remotely add up to a policy. It is simply the continuation of a welfare culture by his party that amounts to gross irresponsibility, married to a something for nothing culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.3/2">In summary, the Bill achieves the following goals. It protects the weak, the disadvantaged and the disabled. There are transitional arrangements in place to help</p>
	<p pid="a.900.3/3">families who are unintentional victims of the Bill in places with high housing costs such as London. It does ensure that workers who are paying the tax that goes to support an enormous benefits bill can see that the Government are taking steps to cap the amounts that are paid out. It is the right thing for Gloucester and for this country, and the amendment is a clumsy, last-minute fudge rather than any solution. I have no hesitation in rejecting it and supporting the Government&#8217;s proposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.901.0/1">I need only a couple of minutes to ask three questions, particularly in relation to the Lords amendment on leaving child benefit out of the cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.0/2">As has been pointed out many times, families earning &#163;35,000 or &#163;40,000 and families on benefits both receive child benefit&#8212;it is a universal benefit. First, then, how can it be right to have the same cap for a single, childless adult as for a family with children? Secondly, why are this Government, of all Governments, importing a new couples penalty into the benefits system? It might make more sense for a couple, each of whom might separately be below the cap, to separate than to stay together and incur it. I have never understood why this Secretary of State, of all Secretaries of State, wants to introduce such a policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.0/3">Thirdly, how will the cap be uprated&#8212;if, indeed, it is to be uprated? What will happen if a family is forced to move to cheaper accommodation because their costs exceed the cap, and then rents rise in their new area and they are forced to move again and again and again? Until we know how the cap is to be uprated, children&#8217;s well-being and family stability will be put at risk, but I have yet to hear Ministers address that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.901.1/1">In the past hour and 45 minutes, we have listened to a debate that sums up the difference between the Labour party and the parties in government. With the leave of the House, I will respond briefly to the remarks that we have heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.1/2">It is my view&#8212;and, I believe, the view of the public listening to this debate&#8212;that we have to change the nature of our welfare state. We have to move away from the world that existed under the previous Government, where children grew up, generation after generation, in houses where no one worked, and where entire communities had people with no experience of work in their family and who knew nothing about how to improve their lot in life. In the Bill, we have introduced a package of measures that will do nothing short of transforming our welfare state.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.1/3">The great tragedy of this afternoon&#8217;s debate is that Labour just does not get it. We have seen an extraordinary attempt by Labour to get itself off a highly visible public hook over a policy that commands overwhelming public support in every constituency in the country. If we walked out on to the streets this afternoon and asked the public what they thought about a benefit cap, we would discover that virtually everyone was 100% behind this policy. Yet what we have heard from the Opposition over the weeks has been an exercise in dancing around the issue. There have been moments when they have said that they favour the benefits cap, but there have been moments when they have said that they oppose it.</p>

We asked the question again and again but they would not answer. They dance around the issue and come up with lame last-ditch excuses and new ideas that they did not discuss in Committee. At the end of the day, they do not want to give an answer to the public. In a moment, they will have to give that answer, because out there are millions of people watching us this afternoon, asking, &#8220;Will the House of Commons back something we passionately believe in?&#8221; We on this side of the House will be walking through the Division Lobby tonight in support of a benefit cap. We will be backing the views of our constituents; the question is: will the Opposition?

	<p pid="a.907.6/1">As Mr Speaker has indicated, Lords amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 26 and 73 impinge on the financial privileges of the House of Commons. In disagreeing to the amendments, I will ask the Reasons Committee to ascribe financial privilege as the reason to the House of Lords. Notwithstanding that, however, the House of Commons has an opportunity to debate the substance of the amendments, and to provide the Government&#8217;s full rationale for rejecting them,</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/2">Lords amendment 1 concerns elements for disabled children. Let us be clear about the impact of the amendment. It would force the Government to reduce support for severely disabled children and, moreover, would go against our commitment to increase support for such children to &#163;77. I believe that our original policy, as agreed in this House, is the right one, because it targets support for disabled people not on age but on need, and removes the cliff edge of financial support that is currently faced by young adults and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/3">In these difficult times, we must make tough choices about where to target our limited resources. The choice that the Government have made is to protect the money that is available to support disabled people in universal credit, and to use it more effectively to ensure that the people who face the biggest challenge are given more support. I repeat that all the money is recycled to support disabled people. What we are doing is thinking about the whole life of an individual, and removing the current artificial division between childhood and adulthood. I hope that that reassures my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>, who spoke earlier about the importance of supporting disabled people. We have ensured that we can protect the money that is so important to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/4">As we have reiterated throughout our debates on the Bill, we are overhauling existing support. It does not really make sense to look at any one aspect of universal credit in isolation: it provides families with a new package of support to meet a range of needs, and for that reason we need to consider the overall impact of the offer rather than concentrating on any of its individual components.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/5">A parent with a disabled child and who is working 20 hours a week on the minimum wage is likely to be &#163;73 better off in work under universal credit, rather than only &#163;13 better off under tax credits. About 30,000 more families with a disabled child are in work than are out of work, so it is right for us to target support in a way that helps working families. An out-of-work family with a disabled child can receive just over &#163;8,000 a year in benefits for their child once universal credit has been introduced. That compares with just over &#163;4,000 for an out-of-work family with a non-disabled child, and about &#163;1,000 for a family who only receive child benefit. Our impact assessments and modelling demonstrate that, overall, families are more likely to be better off on universal credit, and that there will be no significant change for disabled children living in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/6">As all Members know, increasing spending is not an option. We simply cannot maintain the existing rates for disabled children if we are to increase the rates for severely disabled adults. That would cost &#163;200 million, which we simply can not afford. This is a critical point. If the amendment were agreed to, it would not be possible to increase the addition for the most severely disabled people to &#163;77. Let us be clear: the decision to be made is whether we should maintain rates for moderately disabled children at the expense of raising the limits for severely disabled people. We strongly believe that the fairest approach is to align support between children and adults. We take an holistic view of an individual&#8217;s life. In summary, what is fair and right is to simplify benefits within universal credit, and to focus limited resources on the basis of need, not age.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/7">Let me now turn to the amendments that deal with child maintenance:</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/8">&#8220;we should use every lever at our disposal to make reaching a voluntary agreement more attractive than coming into the Child-Maintenance Enforcement Commission.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/9">Those are not my words, but those of the former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, now Lord, Hutton, to a Select Committee of this House in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/10">Let me make four brief points to put the debate in context. Conflict when families break down is bad for children, as we all know from our constituency casework,</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/11">and we all know that all too often that conflict can be embedded and entrenched as a result of problems to do with the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/12">The role of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has changed fundamentally. It is no longer about recovering, pound for pound, the benefits payments made to lone parents. Instead we have a benefits system that gives more than &#163;6.5 billion in welfare payments directly to lone parents, both those in work and those not in work. In the past, change has been piecemeal. That has created the current failing system, which costs taxpayers &#163;500 million every year; has nil-assessed more than 250,000 people, some of whom really should be receiving support; and has 100,000 clerical cases. It would not be putting it too strongly to say that we have inherited a real mess from the Labour party. The reform that we are undertaking is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.907.6/13">My concern is that the amendment from the other place is not about improving the situation; if anything, it would make the situation worse. It is about attempting to divide parents into those who deserve to be charged, and those who do not. Our reforms are about creating a behavioural change for the benefit of children, and about helping parents to work together. The amendment from the other place would make that approach unworkable.</p>

	<p pid="a.909.0/1">I have been listening carefully to what the Minister has to say.

	<p pid="a.909.1/1">I can tell the right hon. Gentleman how many children do not receive any maintenance from the other party. Given that we spend &#163;500 million a year on a child maintenance system, I think that it will shock the House to learn that for half of children living in separated families, there is no support in place. It is clear for everybody to see that the present system simply does not work, and the reason why it does not work is that it does not support families in coming together.</p>

	<p pid="a.909.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. I will come on to this in a bit more detail in a moment, but I have been working with organisations such as Gingerbread, Families Need Fathers, Relate, and the Centre for Separated Families to make sure that we have the sort of support in place that has not been forthcoming for too many years, so that there is a structure for referring individuals to the right level of support via telephone lines, websites and the expert support that already exists. Importantly, we will also make available funding&#8212;some &#163;20 million&#8212;to support</p>

	<p pid="a.910.0/1">I support a lot of what the Minister is trying to do, and I know how dedicated she is to trying to help the Child Support Agency. However, I support the Lords amendment on charging. I agree with charging later on, when people are refusing to adhere to an order, but if the relationship between parents has already broken down, there is a risk that people will not go for the maintenance that they want because of the charging.</p>

	<p pid="a.910.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for the opportunity to clarify an important aspect of the current situation. More than half of parents within the CMEC system would like to make their own arrangements&#8212;they positively want to do that&#8212;if they had the right support in place, but they do not have that support. They see the CMEC and the Child Support Agency as the only option open to them, and that cannot be right. It cannot be right that we are not doing more to support families so that they can take responsibility and do the right thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.910.2/1">Is not the really big change that we are discussing the fact that when the CSA was first established, the maintenance moneys went to the Treasury to offset what taxpayers were putting up because, generally speaking, fathers were not prepared to do so, whereas now that money remains with the family? Is it not reasonable, in such circumstances, if people are going to get a top-up to their benefit that they should contribute to the cost of gaining that extra money? On the timing, should we not charge people once they are getting the money, not before?</p>

	<p pid="a.910.3/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for making that point. He is absolutely right. Indeed, back in 1991 when the Child Support Agency was initially put in place, some &#163;400 million of savings were attached to it because there was a pound-for-pound withdrawal of maintenance and the welfare benefits that an individual received.</p>

I want to put on record my thanks to those groups that have worked hard with us to develop what that support should be&#8212;they are, as I have said, Gingerbread, Relate, Families Need Fathers, and the Centre for Separated Families. For families that need the more structured approach of the statutory scheme it will remain accessible and heavily subsidised, but there will be in-built incentives for parents always to see the advantages of working collaboratively and in-built incentives for parents to pay maintenance in full and on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.3/3">Maintenance direct will be a no-cost way for parents to make ongoing payments to each other within the statutory scheme and the full statutory collection scheme, with its strong enforcement powers, will be a service that both parents pay for.</p>

	<p pid="a.912.0/1">I share the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s experiences of the current system and although I pay tribute to the staff who work in the Child Support Agency and the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission for their efforts to make the system work, we all know, as constituency MPs, that there is a big problem with parents&#8217; attitudes towards payment. There is absolutely nothing in place at the moment to prevent parents from simply waiting until enforcement comes into play. Our measures will ensure that that changes, and will mean there is always an incentive for people to pay on time. Importantly, we will ensure that if we have to take heavy enforcement action, the individual who has caused the situation will pay for it, whether through a deduction of earnings order or through other measures we are putting in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.912.0/2">It is not the Government&#8217;s intention to block parents from using the statutory scheme and we are listening hard to the concerns of parliamentarians in both Houses. To that end, the Government have proposed amendment 75 to ensure that there is a review of charging, and a report to Parliament will be completed within 30 months of the introduction of that mechanism. I can announce today that to underline that commitment the up-front charge for parents choosing to use the statutory scheme will be reduced to &#163;20 for all applicants. In return, parents will receive a calculation of maintenance payable that will, for the first time, be based routinely on HMRC data. Additionally, domestic violence victims will be completely exempt from the application charge. I am sure the whole House will welcome this announcement, which demonstrates that no family will be deterred from accessing the statutory system purely on the basis of cost.</p>

Not even under the simplest model of implementation could we see a way to set a level playing field of the sort that parents really need at such a difficult time.

An additional effect of the amendment would be to put almost 100% of the ongoing charges on the non-resident parent. We agree that non-resident parents should have a clear incentive to pay a greater contribution to the ongoing costs, but I fear that simply loading all those costs on the non-resident parent could drive some perverse incentives and not provide the ability for parents to work in the collaborative way that I have set out.</p>

	<p pid="a.914.3/1">We would acknowledge that reducing the amount of money that must be paid up front by the applicant is a step in the right direction, but I am still not clear about the rationale behind the non-resident carer being more likely to pay up because the applicant must pay a charge. I am concerned about conceding the principle of paying up front, because what will stop the Government coming back in a year&#8217;s time and hiking up the &#163;20 fee to &#163;100 or &#163;150?

It is really important that the up-front charge does not become a deterrent, which is why we will look at how charging is working 30 months after implementation. I remind her that the parent with care receives, in return for her up-front fee, a clear and detailed calculation of how much money would be payable to her through maintenance, and for the first time the calculation will use HMRC data, which will ensure that she has all the information needed to decide whether it is appropriate to go into either maintenance direct, where there will be no ongoing charges, or the statutory system.</p>

Of course, we are all very quizzical about the CSA when it comes to costs, because we know that it has been very difficult to administer over the years.

By charging an up-front fee and getting people to reconsider staying outside the system, we will be making considerable savings, as I have outlined. When she considers that each case costs around &#163;26,000, or up to &#163;40,000 if it involves any sort of enforcement, she will quickly see that getting people to reconsider will lead to significant savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.915.4/1">The hon. Gentleman and I know that self-employed people, although a small number of individuals, are disproportionately represented in the problem cases that hon. Members have. He will also know that self-employed people still have to do tax returns, so rather than ex-partners having to pursue individuals who might be self-employed and have no office at which we can get hold of them, we will be able to use the HMRC link, which I think is an important improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.4/2">With regard to the enforcement that we will be taking to ensure that things really stick, first and foremost it is about ensuring that there is an understanding in the House about the charges that we will put in place for that enforcement action. Implementing a deduction of earnings order does not currently cost the person defaulting on their maintenance a bean. We are talking about making sure that those charges are passed on, which I think taxpayers would expect us to do. We will also consider implementing some of the other enforcement measures that Labour Members put in place through the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008.</p>

That is money we can use to support families directly through organisations, such as those I have mentioned, and that is why we have made up-front a very clear commitment to taking &#163;20 million of the money that we will save and directly investing in it in beneficial support for families. That is the right thing to do with the money that we are saving, as is making our contribution to reducing the budget deficit, which we inherited from the Labour party.</p>

But it is not practical to insist that they move when there is nowhere smaller to move to, so Lords amendment 4 is entirely reasonable, because it states, where</p>

I say clearly to him that we are saying that there is a great deal of time and considerable support for individuals who find themselves in difficult situations. We need to make sure that as many people as possible are able to remain where they are and that they are given the support to do that.</p>

Friend to consider how we would deal with what would be an enormous loss to the savings. Our basic problem is that there are 1 million spare bedrooms while about 250,000 families live in overcrowded accommodation. It is important for us to try to balance all those factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.919.5/1">I reassure you, Mr Speaker, that I will make the rest of my contribution very brief indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/2">The average weekly reduction is likely to be about &#163;14. However, that is the average. Nearly 80% of claimants are under-occupying their accommodation by just one bedroom and will see an average reduction of about &#163;12 a week. Working for just a few hours a week could help to meet that cost. The substantial investment that we are making in the Work programme and universal credit will ensure that people are supported in finding work, and that that work will pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/3">We have listened to the concerns about the impact that these changes will have on specific groups, so we have committed to increase the budget for discretionary housing payments by &#163;30 million from 2013-14. That additional money, which could help about 40,000 claimants, is aimed specifically at disabled people and accommodation for foster carers. We are working closely with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that we have an effective implementation plan that will support tenants, their advisers and housing providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.5/4">Ultimately, the country cannot afford to fund what is approaching 1 million spare rooms from the taxes of hardworking families, when those spare rooms could be used by other families who are living in overcrowded accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="a.920.0/1">The chief executive of Halton Housing Trust has written to me. He states:</p>
	<p pid="a.920.0/2">&#8220;Based on existing turnover of smaller accommodation it will take over seven years to re-house all of those households who are under occupying their current homes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.920.0/3">He goes on to state that, in particular, it will affect</p>
	<p pid="a.920.0/4">&#8220;homeless households and those leaving care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.920.0/5">Does the Minister really think that that is fair?</p>

	<p pid="a.920.1/1">That is why we are already working with local authorities to ensure that they are well prepared for the changes. We have discretionary payments in place so that local authorities can take account of such problems. We reject the Lords amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.920.1/2">I will now move on to the remaining amendments so that I do not incur the wrath of Mr Speaker. The other Lords amendments in this group are minor and technical or simply clarify policy. They have already been announced and I do not intend to go into any further detail so that there is more time for Members to contribute to this important debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.920.6/1">I will not follow the same order as the Minister. I will deal first with under-occupancy, because rarely have I heard such a pathetic defence of a Government&#8217;s position as I have heard here today. Their proposals are not based on fairness, and they are not intended to deal with the under-occupation of social housing. They are a bare-faced attempt to cut housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.920.6/2">Frankly, even though the Minister spoke for three quarters of an hour and kept telling us that she wanted to make progress, I felt as though we were back in the 19th century given some of what she said. She talked about social tenants as though they were a breed apart. I noticed that she called them &#8220;these people&#8221;. Many Members were once &#8220;these people&#8221; living in social housing, and some of us still are.</p>

Local authorities have legal duties to their tenants, and if somebody from Salford is seeking to downsize, local authorities in Doncaster or Hull are not permitted to take them because of residency qualifications. Will my right hon. Friend help me to understand something that the Government have completely failed to explain? How will tenants be able to move from one local authority to another?</p>

She will obviously be aware of the new national home swap scheme, which, importantly, will help people to identify housing in other areas, which is what she is talking about.

	<p pid="a.923.8/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point and no doubt he will pursue it outside this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.923.8/2">Before I move on, I want the House to hear what Lord Freud said in the other place when asked about how people would cover the reduction in rent. The Minister glibly passed over it, saying that it was only &#163;12 or &#163;14 on average. Lord Freud said:</p>
	<p pid="a.923.8/3">&#8220;Claimants affected by this measure will have to decide whether to meet any shortfall themselves&#8212;from their earnings for example, or they could take in a lodger, or someone they know, to fill the extra bedrooms.&#8221;&#8212;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-10-18">18 October 2011</phrase>; Vol. 731, c. GC72.]</p>
	<p pid="a.923.8/4">How many times does the Government expect people to take lodgers into their family home? Will social landlords even allow lodgers to be taken in, because in my experience they do not allow it? I see the Liberal Democrats are nodding. Ministers also need to make it clear whether rent received in such circumstances would be taken into account in benefit calculations. They are putting people in an unbelievable bind.</p>
	<p pid="a.923.8/5">This proposal is ill thought-out and will not achieve its aims. It is predicated on an assumption in the impact assessment that will not work. It will push the poorest people, including those who are working&#8212;we should not forget that this is an in-work benefit&#8212;into even greater disadvantage. It will force social landlords to take eviction action if people end up in arrears. In other words, it is a disaster of a policy, and we should support the Lords in these amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.924.0/1">As well as the socially disastrous consequences that my right hon. Friend has mentioned, does she recognise that under the parity principle this measure would have to be transposed to Northern Ireland? Particular difficulties will be caused in relation to access to social housing in the future and to the demands for new social houses that are benefit-sized to be built in particular locations. Given the geo-sectarian tensions in parts of Northern Ireland, it could be a factor for destabilisation, with certain communities being seen to be punished for their current demographic status.</p>

	<p pid="a.925.3/1">I always hate to disappoint Tories, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/2">The Minister mentioned some concessions, but it remains an unfair imposition on parents with caring responsibilities to make them pay a fee to obtain, in her words, a calculation of what they may be entitled to. The Government are always keen to say that people should do the right thing, but what happens when they try to do the right thing and adopt a collaborative approach? Frankly, all the evidence shows that a collaborative approach is often the last thing that people can get when a marriage breaks down&#8212;all sorts of issues to do with personalities, emotions and children being part of the bartering process between two parents make that almost impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/3">The Minister was a bit dismissive of some of her colleagues in the House of Lords. I want to come back to them in a moment. If the Minister gets the opportunity to wind up, will she tell the House where the Government got the figure of &#163;25,000 from? That, apparently, is the cost to the taxpayer of each case. I cannot find the source for that figure. If we divide 1,142,600 cases into &#163;450 million, which is how much it costs to run the CSA, we get an annual cost of &#163;393.90. So where on earth does the &#163;25,000 figure come from? I would be interested to know.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/4">Members of the House of Lords did not just object to the amount of money to be paid; they objected on the basis of the principle that if a parent with caring responsibilities was entitled to maintenance for the children or child whom they looked after, they should get that support. An array of Conservative Members of the House of Lords have asked the Government to change their mind: Lord Carrington, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Lord Howe of Aberavon, Lord Jenkin, Lord Lawson of Blaby, Lord MacGregor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern,</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/5">Lord Mawhinney, Lord Mayhew, Lord Newton and Lord Wakeham. I remember the &#8217;80s, and I do not think that any of these people were fully paid up members of the liberal tendency. Yet they have all asked the Government to change their mind on the point of principle. I hope, then, that we get something more than what we heard from the Minister tonight. This is a ridiculous provision that, frankly, should not have been in the Bill in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/6">Now we come to disabled children. This is the cut that even the Prime Minister did not want to admit to. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase> again asked about it today, and again the Prime Minister refused to recognise the reality. I particularly congratulate the Lords on dealing with this issue and not running away from it, because it would have been easy for them to put this matter to one side after they were defeated by two votes on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-12">12 December</phrase>. But they did not. They returned to it last night and voted to challenge the Government on the cuts to the disabled children allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/7">The Minister has been clever with her statistics but according to Every Disabled Child Matters, the loss under the new system could amount to as much as &#163;22,000 during the childhood of a disabled child and will cost the parents of a disabled child nearly &#163;1,400 a year, and approximately 170,000 families will have this benefit frozen from 2013. I admit that there are transitional arrangements, but I have never come across a piece of legislation with so much sticking tape&#8212;there are reviews here and transitional arrangements there. This is not a strategy; it is a dog&#8217;s mess.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/8">Every Disabled Child Matters estimates that approximately 63% of all future disabled children will lose out as a result of this policy. The Minister is an honourable woman and has tried to be gentle with the House today by using fine words about how this will not mean one thing to children and will mean another thing, but the reality is that in order to pay the most severely disabled children an extra &#163;1.75 a week, children who are not as disabled&#8212;I use those words advisedly&#8212;will lose their benefit. We are talking about children who, for the most part, do not have night-time care needs. Typically, they include children with Down&#8217;s syndrome or cerebral palsy, and children who are profoundly deaf. In future, disabled children will not receive any benefit from the transitional arrangements; indeed, any disabled child born after 2013 will access significantly less support.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/9">I appeal to Members, particularly Liberal Democrat Members. I hope that they will look at what their colleagues supported in the Lords. In fact, I even appeal&#8212;although not very much&#8212;to some Conservative Members to look at what their colleagues in the Lords did. This is an amendment to be supported. It is about decency, about disabled children and about the support that families who are at the hard end of looking after disabled children deserve to receive. I hope that this House supports the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/10">I said that I would not speak as long as the Minister, but I want briefly to draw the House&#8217;s attention to Lords amendment 77. At the end of the last day on Report, the Government secured an amendment to the Bill that, on closer examination, significantly weakened obligations that had been placed on them by the previous Government&#8217;s Child Poverty Act 2010. That amendment replaces references to &#8220;progress&#8221; in the 2010 Act with</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/11">much weaker language about &#8220;measures&#8221;. Child Poverty Action Group, among others, points out that that is, in effect, removing the duty to achieve any progress towards meeting the targets before 2020. I hope that we do not lose sight of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.3/12">I have tried&#8212;in a shorter time than the Minister&#8212;to set out some of the issues that have been raised in recent weeks. Labour Members feel very strongly about those issues because they impact on the poorest, those who are most disadvantaged and those who have been demonised because they live in socially rented housing, and because they do not take into account that children at the age of 14 or 15 might require a bit of extra room and do not all need to be decanted into a tiny box of a flat. I appeal to the Government to consider seriously what is being proposed today, and to support the Lords amendments rather than disagreeing with them.</p>

The example I gave to the Minister the other day&#8212;a close family member of mine is going through this at the moment&#8212;concerns an errant partner who is being chased more aggressively, and successfully, for his parking fine than for the maintenance of his own children. It seems that the system is currently based entirely on conflict. We need to do something to address that. I agree with everything that the Minister said&#8212;and with her intention&#8212;about encouraging people to come to their own arrangements. However, I am a little concerned in that I do not necessarily think that, for a lot of people, levying a &#163;20 charge&#8212;or any charge&#8212;against what will normally be the mother is likely to effect that change.</p>
	<p pid="a.927.0/3">We have all seen cases where communication has completely broken down and where the errant parent&#8212;normally the father&#8212;is doing everything they can to avoid having to pay, particularly if they are self-employed, because the system seems to assist self-employed parents in avoiding their responsibilities. I am not sure that imposing a charge on&#8212;normally&#8212;the mother is likely to change that situation greatly or effect the cultural change that I think we all want.</p>

It seems to be more about effecting a cultural change, and I do not believe that charging the mother &#163;20 will effect such a change. It would therefore end up being a tax on the mother who is trying to get money from an errant father. That is why I have a bit of a problem with the principle.</p>

	<p pid="a.928.10/3">I represented a big council estate on which there was a huge amount of under-occupancy, which was largely, but not entirely, due to older people. Dealing with the matter is not as simple as just talking about housing swaps.

One party often gets cold feet and pulls out of the arrangement, for example. It is not easy to achieve at all.</p>

I am sure that the Ministers understand this, but I plead with them to take account of the fact that houses are not only public assets; they are also people&#8217;s homes, and people have an attachment to them. This is not a simple matter to resolve, even though we should encourage an end to under-occupancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.929.5/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase>, and I shall echo some of his remarks on the child maintenance charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/2">I have been privileged to be a Member for 20 years, and I have noted that the issue of child maintenance and child support has been a running controversy and a running sore through Parliament and Government during that whole period. I shall briefly remind the House of the background. While there have, of course, always been children in this and similar countries brought up</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/3">by only one parent&#8212;war widows after the first world war would be an obvious example&#8212;it is nevertheless true that in the post-war period there has been a kind of social revolution whereby very significant numbers of children spend either a proportion or all of their childhoods living&#8212;usually with their mum but sometimes, in a minority of cases, with their father&#8212;in so-called one-parent families. That is about divorce, which remains at a high level; it is about separation&#8212;and cohabitation is more likely to lead to separation than marriage; it is about the fact that many children are born &#8220;out of wedlock&#8221;, to use a quaint term, and live with a single mother.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/4">This has been a major contributory cause to what we call child poverty, which interfaces with economic insecurity. I think that Parliaments and Governments have found it more difficult to grapple with and honestly discuss family insecurity than economic insecurity caused by low wages or unemployment. As I say, Governments have found it difficult. The old maintenance system, which was run by the courts, did not work: it delivered low levels of maintenance or no maintenance to many mothers and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/5">The previous Conservative Government established the Child Support Agency&#8212;I think they were right to do so&#8212;but many former Conservative Ministers bear the scars of trying to make it work. They did not make it work effectively for all children. That was not because of incompetence&#8212;there were computer problems and the rest&#8212;but because this is one of the most difficult areas of government. It is the state&#8212;perfectly properly, in my judgment&#8212;trying to mediate during the pain, anger and passions of family breakdown, when issues of access and custody are also present. Although the old Child Support Agency had some successes, it never succeeded in getting maintenance from those fathers&#8212;yes, I know, sometimes mothers, but I am going to talk about fathers&#8212;who absolutely refused to fulfil their parental obligation and support their own children.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/6">The last Labour Government tried to improve the situation and they might have done to some extent, but if we are honest about this&#8212;I am not normally one who tries to take the politics out of politics; otherwise I would have to join the Liberal Democrat party&#8212;some humility is justified in this case. For getting on for 20 years, Governments of left and right have failed to tackle this issue adequately. We really need to point again at the sheer scandal of there being too many parents out there who refuse to support their own children financially. That is the reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/7">When I intervened on the Minister&#8212;it was good of her to give me the statistics&#8212;she said that among these families half, fully half, are not receiving child maintenance. What does that mean? It means either that the children are living in relative poverty and/or that other mums and dads in the community, whom we call taxpayers, are being asked in difficult economic circumstances to support not only their own children but other people&#8217;s children as well. What I am leading up to is to ask whether the idea of a charge to be able to use the system helps or hinders that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/8">I do not think I am against a charge per se. Given that taxpayers have a stake in this, as well as, usually, the mother or &#8220;the parent with care&#8221; to use the awful jargon, and the child&#8212;they are the parties that have an interest in this&#8212;I am not against the taxpayer in a sense benefiting through proper payment of maintenance. We</p>
	<p pid="a.929.5/9">could discuss how that might come about; but if there is to be a charge, as was argued by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, why should it not be levied when the flows of maintenance are coming to the mother and benefiting the child? Why should a fee be charged immediately rather than later in the process? I think that many Members would agree with that, but perhaps the Minister would like to comment.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for allowing me to answer his question. Fees and charges have been inherent in the child maintenance system from the start, since 1991. As he knows, his own party advocated the use of fees when it was in government, as indeed did Sir David Henshaw. Why? Because charging fees is a way of trying to get people to take responsibility. If that is done up front before an individual gets into the system, we are more likely to effect the behavioural change that I think is so important.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.1/1">In general, it is the mothers of Britain&#8212;sometimes it is the fathers with care, but it is generally the mothers&#8212;who have taken on huge responsibilities. It is the parent who does not pay who is the irresponsible party, and who reneges on his duty to care for his own children. I want a system that can be tough-minded about the fathers who refuse to pay. They are often self-employed, and have become deliberately self-employed. The mothers often know where they live. A mother will have heard about the new person in the father&#8217;s life, about the fancy car outside the house, about the foreign holidays&#8212;yet the system has failed to make those fathers pay. Let me put the question to the Minister again. Will a charge help in those circumstances?</p>
	<p pid="a.931.1/2">Many mums will know that the Child Support Agency, or whatever we choose to call it, does not work. We want to make it work, but people say, &#8220;My friends didn&#8217;t get anywhere.&#8221; Only recently I discussed with the Secretary of State the case of one of my constituents who, throughout the lifetime of four children, never received any maintenance. That person thinks that the system does not work. I want it to work, but if some mothers are deterred from using the system, it will be a failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.1/3">This should not be a big party issue, and I hope that the Department will reflect again on when the charge might be levied.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.2/1">I support my hon. Friend the Minister on the issue of the Child Support Agency, but I want to make a brief observation on the housing benefit issue. My constituency might be wholly different from those of the Members who have spoke so far, but the overwhelming majority of the cases I deal with at my surgery involve people who want additional rooms because they have growing families or families who are becoming older. If this charge causes some people to want to downsize, that will help to strike a balance, but at present I do not encounter people who want to downsize.</p>

	<p pid="a.932.5/2">I am also reluctant to take issue with the Lords unnecessarily. When I was Secretary of State for Social Security, I found that from time to time the Lords would propose amendments to legislation that I had introduced. At first I was shocked that anyone could think that my legislation could be improved in any way, but when I listened to what was said by the Lords in general and the bishops in particular, I usually found that it contained an element of truth. There was something worth listening to, even if I could not take on board everything that they proposed. I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister has listened to them, has modified the charging structure, and has taken their points on board. However, she is probably right not to adopt the whole principle of what the other place suggests.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.5/3">I am not entirely persuaded of the Lords&#8217; case, because I think that it is right in principle to charge for a costly service, and it is right that the people who principally benefit from it should pay an element of it in the form of a charge, rather than our leaving the entire cost to the other party or the taxpayer. It is right in principle, too, that wherever possible we encourage voluntary agreements, rather than reliance on state-funded bureaucracy, because voluntary agreements, where possible, are better, and because that reduces the load on an over-extended bureaucracy that has never been able to cope with the load that it has; it is better that it focuses on the most obdurate cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.5/4">It is right in principle to charge both parents, as it is not possible, even though their lordships&#8217; amendment implies that it is, to distinguish who is the goody and who the baddy.</p>

	<p pid="a.933.0/1">I will let the hon. Lady make her own points in due course. We may reach our own judgments on who is right and who is wrong, but we cannot make the agency decide that. Both parents will benefit from an arrangement reached by the CSA, and it is right that it should make that arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/2">I noticed that there were an awful lot of lawyers on the voting lists in the House of Lords. Lawyers do not say, &#8220;We won&#8217;t charge you if you&#8217;re right; we&#8217;ll only charge you if you&#8217;re wrong. We won&#8217;t charge you if you&#8217;re the aggrieved party; we&#8217;ll only charge the other party.&#8221; They should accept that similar rules apply to charging by the CSA.</p>

On balance, I think that my hon. Friend the Minister was right to make the modest concession that she did to her lordships, but to stick to the principle; I am glad that she has done so.</p>

	<p pid="a.933.1/1">I want to make a point on child support, and a point on the Child Poverty Act 2010 and the change that the Government are planning to make to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.1/2">I point out that there is an inequality of bargaining power, particularly in a high-conflict situation, which means that parents with care&#8212;usually women&#8212;do not have a choice on whether to arrive at a consensual agreement. In practice, women in particular will settle for little or nothing for the sake of a quiet life because they cannot afford the fee. I particularly take exception to the idea that a parent with care who has done everything possible to reach a voluntary agreement, but who meets with a resistant, recalcitrant non-resident parent, will have to pay a fee when it is absolutely no fault of hers that she and, more to the point, her children do not get the financial support that they should.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40318" name="Peter Lilley">The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley)</phrase> says that it is right that those who benefit from or seek to access the service should pay a fee, but it is children who are intended to benefit from a statutory system of child support. Is it right that money intended for children should be hypothecated in that way?</p>
	<p pid="a.933.1/4">The right hon. Gentleman and the Minister seem to believe that it is impossible for the child support system to take a view on which parent is at fault, but in clause 138 of the Bill, that view is taken by the system, because access to the collection service is being limited to cases in which the commission has decided that maintenance will not otherwise be payable. If it is possible for the commission to make that assessment and to determine that there is no prospect of the non-resident parent making payment, how can no view be taken on whether efforts have been made to receive a voluntary payment or not?</p>
	<p pid="a.933.1/5">The majority of lone parents are women and women are already typically worse off after separation or divorce whereas men are better off. The fact that those parents will now be hit with a further fee as there will be both an up-front fee and a fee for collection when that collection fails&#8212;although I welcome the fact that the fee has been</p>
	<p pid="a.933.1/6">cut to &#163;20, I would like to see it at zero&#8212;means that those families on low incomes will be left with very little income.</p>

	<p pid="a.934.0/1">How does the hon. Lady suggest that the agency should decide which parent stood in the way of an agreement? Would she take the same view as was taken in the debate in the other place, which is that it would always be the non-resident parent&#8217;s fault that an agreement was not in place?</p>

	<p pid="a.934.1/1">The point is that a system is being established whereby the parent with care must access the system. There will be a discussion at that point about the process by which that approach to the agency is made. There is no difficulty at all at that point in taking a decision about the responsibility and behaviour of the parent making that application. I cannot understand why the Government think that it is perfectly okay for other officials in the DWP to make decisions on whether people are making appropriate efforts to make themselves available for employment, but not for a decision to be taken on whether a parent has properly engaged in a process of seeking to reach agreement with a non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.934.1/2">I also want to speak briefly about the Government&#8217;s proposal to amend the obligation on the child poverty target under the Child Poverty Act. The current obligation is for the Government to report on the progress that must be made to achieve child poverty targets&#8212;targets to which every party in this House has signed up. There will now be a far weaker requirement simply to report on proposed measures. In other words, there will be an obligation on the Government to report on what they might or might not do, but absolutely no obligation to report on whether it works or on what difference it makes. That undermines what lies at the heart of the Act, which was a genuine wish across the House in the previous Parliament to see real progress in bringing down child poverty and for every politician in this House to be accountable for that outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.934.1/3">I very much regret such a weakening of the Child Poverty Act. In future, the Government could legally produce a child poverty strategy that makes no reference to the number of children in poverty&#8212;an extremely important measure in driving progress&#8212;and has no clear goals for how the proposed actions will reduce that number. When the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that the cumulative impact of the Government&#8217;s welfare reforms on other measures will be to drive up child poverty between now and 2015 and onwards to 2020, one has to wonder whether the proposal is not a rather cynical and calculating step on the part of the Government to wriggle out of an obligation that they know they are not on track to meet.</p>

	<p pid="a.934.2/1">I want to speak quickly on under-occupancy and the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.934.2/2">The main concern on the Liberal Democrat Benches about under-occupancy and the housing benefit proposals&#8212;as hon. Members have heard from a couple of my colleagues and from Members on both sides of the House&#8212;is about the impact on rural areas and, in particular, the Scottish islands. There is also a concern about urban areas where an active allocation policy has</p>
	<p pid="a.934.2/3">meant that families have been given larger houses in areas that are less popular. I appreciate that it is difficult to lay out in legislation the need to ensure that tenants are offered appropriate alternative accommodation, but it is important that we ensure that when alternative offers are made they should take into account issues such as family and support networks, which are particularly important in helping people to get back into work. Offers should also take into account the distance people will have to travel, how that will relate to the communities, the lack of public transport in rural areas and so on, as well as where people are working and how easy it is for them to commute if they are required to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.934.2/4">I understand that the Government will be doing that through discretionary housing payments, but I would be grateful if the Minister would ensure that guidance making those elements very clear is provided for local authorities. I know that discretionary housing payments are ring-fenced, and that is extremely important, but it is also important that general rules taking into account a sensible approach of looking at community links and the availability of alternative accommodation, or lack thereof, are applied across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.935.1/1">I am not going to give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.935.1/2">Another concern is that it will take a while to move people and for accommodation to become available. Registered social landlords are concerned to know how long the process will take, so that they can enable a managed process. While that happens, there will be an impact on their income as arrears are likely to build up before alternative accommodation becomes available. Some RSLs have done work on this, including Riverside housing association, which is based in Merseyside. It has calculated that it will take it at least three years to move everybody around. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

Will she ensure that discretionary housing payments are available throughout that period so that people do not receive a large cut in their benefit while they are waiting for alternative accommodation to become available?

	<p pid="a.936.0/1">I thank the Minister for that useful information, which answers in part some of the questions I was going to ask.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.0/2">It would be helpful if the Government kept an eye on progress. Certain money has been put aside for adapted properties, foster carers and so on, but it would be useful to know that if other vulnerable groups or particular parts of the country are identified as a particular problem, the Government would ensure that that was taken into account in the future allocation of money and in how they look at the impact of the policy on households.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.0/3">On the Child Support Agency, there is a problem with up-front costs, particularly with the gap that was originally in the proposals between the amount required from those who are working compared with that required from those on benefits. I therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s announcement today that they are reducing the fee to &#163;20, which will make a significant difference for a lot of households. Now, we just need to make sure that the service being provided is worth the up-front fee, which frankly it has not been in the past. I hope that we will see some progress in this area so that people will feel they are getting something for their money.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.0/4">The Minister knows about a particular concern of mine, which I want to raise again today. I still have serious concern about the closing down of old cases and their transferral to the new system. I am sure that all MPs have had people come to see them in surgery with cases in which an irresponsible non-resident parent will not pay, plays the system, refuses to support their own children, and takes years to pin down until a deduction of earnings order in finally put in place. I am concerned about the impact on children of cancelling those orders and making the parent with care start the entire process again, not least because of the difficulties many have had with the CSA in the past and the lack of faith they have in the system. I would be grateful if the Minister would ensure that those cases were prioritised to ensure that when they are transferred to the new system they are properly monitored so that payment keeps flowing as much as possible and that if payment must stop it is only for a very short period so that huge arrears cannot build up, because those cases are the most likely to have a background of large arrears already.</p>

What are the Government going to do? I hear the Minister say that discretionary payments will be provided until 2014, but that is not the eight to 10 years that my association says it will take for even the people who want to downsize.

The other points that I want to make both arise from a constituent&#8217;s coming to see me. This particular family has four members, with two disabled people within it, and it needs four rooms. From the outside, someone might say that parents and two children need two or three rooms, which would give them one spare room. Absolutely not: in this case, every single room was needed, and the family was concerned that under the legislation they would be told that they had a spare room and be forced to move. I would like some reassurance on that point&#8212;that where people need all the rooms because of disability, certain rooms will not be considered spare, even if the family being of such a size might otherwise justify that decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.937.3/1">I can reassure my hon. Friend that if a disabled person has the need for an overnight carer, additional rooms can be allocated. Indeed, if there are disabled people in the house who require rooms, there will be clear support there for them to be able to have those rooms.</p>

	<p pid="a.937.4/1">I thank the Minister for that reassurance. On my second point, as hon. and right hon. Members know, many homes have had thousands of pounds spent on adaptations, and rightly so, for disabled people. It would not make a great deal of sense to ask people to move from a home that had had such adaptations into another home, where making such adaptations would</p>
	<p pid="a.937.4/2">cost plenty of money. Also, in the first home, the adaptations might have to be removed. Again, I ask for reassurance that common sense will prevail.</p>

	<p pid="a.938.0/1">If ever a piece of legislation was to demonise and penalise people who live in the social rented sector, this Bill is it, and I have listened to the debate today. My local authority in Durham has written to me to say that many thousands of families will be affected by the under-occupancy provisions, and both the local authority and the housing associations have written to say that they simply do not have enough alternative suitable housing and that it will take many years to re-house people. That means that tenants, who are already on low incomes, will have no alternative but to pay an additional sum of money&#8212;up to &#163;50 a month&#8212;that they simply cannot afford or move into smaller, private rented accommodation if it is available, and in places like Durham it is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.0/2">The point that the Government must take on board is that if those people go into smaller and more expensive accommodation, that will have to be paid for from housing benefit in any case, so the whole policy is an absolute&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.955.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="955"  time="019:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0004.htm#12020189003466">
	<p pid="a.955.2/1">It is almost commonplace nowadays to say that the greening of our economy must take place, and must take place quickly. We know that a low-carbon economy offers not just challenges&#8212;although it certainly offers challenges&#8212;but enormous opportunities, and the success of the green investment bank is vital to that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/2">I congratulate the Minister and his Department on an initiative which, as the Minister knows, has been welcomed across the country, if only in the locations where councils are making active bids. As I shall demonstrate, the level of support in Greater Manchester is such, and the quality of the Manchester bid is so strong, that had Manchester not submitted a bid, the Minister would probably have asked us to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/3">I can certainly say that the bid has the support of a number of people, including, obviously, my hon. Friends the Members for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) and for Bolton West (Julie Hilling), my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40679" name="Paul Goggins">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins)</phrase>, my hon. Friends the Members for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) and for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">the hon. Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase> on the Government Benches. It is important to say that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40041" name="Graham Brady">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale West (Mr Brady)</phrase>, the chairman of the 1922 committee, has asked me to place on record his strong support for the Manchester bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/4">Manchester has some strong positives when it comes to meeting the criteria that the Government have said are fundamental to the location of the green investment bank. It is always tempting for anyone from the north of England to take a position that does not always see London as the centre of the universe, possibly because it is not, but there are strong reasons why locating the bank in London would send the wrong signals about the type of economy that we want to build in the United Kingdom. That is not an anti-London statement, but a simple matter of practical fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/5">We want to use the green investment bank to engineer investment, particularly in manufacturing, and we want to break the cycle of an investment system that has historically been quite hostile to manufacturing, and that is very much based round the London service ethos. People in parts of the north of England have said to me that it is difficult to get the merchant banks to take seriously investment outside the golden triangle of Oxbridge and London; we need to consider location as a key factor in that, particularly if we recognise that one of the roles of the green investment bank will be to overcome the traditional problems of market reluctance or, even worse, market failure. In that sense, a location outside London is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/6">Of course, there are practical reasons why the Manchester bid would be better than anything that could possibly come from within London, but I repeat that this is not about pitting Manchester against London; historically, when that has happened, Manchester has normally won the intellectual arguments, if not the physical arguments that go with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/7">The Government have laid down important criteria, one of which relates to the concept of connectivity. Of course, in the modern world, Manchester&#8217;s international airport is a tremendous asset, particularly when we consider that some 200 cities around the world are accessible from Manchester airport. I would not pretend that that competes with the southern regional airport system that includes Heathrow and Gatwick&#8212;of course it is possible to access more cities from them&#8212; but Manchester is only a short flight away from that London airport system. We also have very good train communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/8">In the modern world, it may not be the physical transportation of people that matters, but the movement of information and, in that area, Manchester scores very highly, not simply against other non-London cities, but against London. Manchester already has one of the most advanced, competitive telecommunications and internet infrastructures in Europe, and it is the only UK city outside London with an international internet exchange. It is the only city in the UK including London to offer next-generation broadband, with fibre to premises allowing remarkable speeds in a true open-access network. BT has completed a &#163;575 million investment programme that places Manchester 10 years ahead of other UK cities, in terms of access to digital communication. Those are the types of connections that the world of today&#8212;and the world of tomorrow&#8212;will demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/9">As for the requirement for adequate office space and energy-efficient offices, the modern offices in Spinningfields, the Co-operative Bank area and Piccadilly place are already the rival of any in the country. Such offices are easily available in Manchester, and are being built to the very highest environmental standards. I think that it is true to say that we have more office space that hits the highest levels of environmental efficiency than other cities outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/10">Manchester has huge and growing business, financial and professional services sectors; 250,000 people already work in those sectors, 50,000 of them in finance, insurance and banking. Of course, Manchester also has a powerful transaction ecosystem&#8212;one of the criteria that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills specified was necessary for a successful bid. We have the Manchester Private Equity Group, and a financial and banking system that is already well used to operating in a transaction ecosystem. Of course, Manchester scores very highly in its cost-effectiveness as a location.</p>

	<p pid="a.956.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a splendid and excellent speech, which I am sure the Minister will not be able to resist. May I just add two details that might aid him? First, Manchester airport has more destinations than Heathrow and, secondly, banks thrive better where there are other banks and Manchester is undoubtedly the second financial centre in this country.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.956.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="956"  time="019:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0004.htm#12020189003468">
	<p pid="a.956.1/1">My hon. Friend probably knows as much about transportation&#8212;and particularly air transportation&#8212;as almost any hon. Member and he is right about the position of Manchester airport. That is a very important plus, because Manchester airport, by definition, is down the road from the thriving city centre. The growing efficiency of our local transportation system means that it is easily accessible by anybody who comes to the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/2">My hon. Friend&#8217;s second point is absolutely right, too. The strength of Manchester&#8217;s banking system is really important and, in that light, I want to mention the quite recent move by the Bank of New York Mellon, which invested in the city centre. The bank took a decision to come to Manchester some six years ago. Before it first came, it scoured the country in a manner that was very similar to the process that is going ahead for the green investment bank and it considered very similar criteria for the location of its new investment in Britain. At the time, the investment covered a couple of hundred people, who were easily found. They were people of the highest quality, of course, because BNY Mellon was not going to set up without people of both expertise and competence, given that those people would be dealing with the bank&#8217;s UK clients. Those people were recruited from the Manchester labour market, because the existence of the banking system mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40091" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)</phrase> meant that that labour pool was easily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/3">BNY Mellon has found that as it has expanded&#8212;it has expanded very quickly in six years and now employs more than 1,000 people&#8212;it has been able to expand its pool of labour precisely because of that nexus of people in the banking and financial services sector who were readily available. In particular&#8212;I hope that the Minister will pay particular attention to this point&#8212;the fact that people had the skills and were in the professions that the bank was looking for meant that, as the labour force increased, that had a non-inflationary impact on the bank and on the local labour market. That is an important factor to consider in the location of the green investment bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/4">I am aware that the hon. Member for Bury North wants to show that support for this bid is felt strongly across the normal partisan political divides in the House, so I shall conclude. The bid is supported by people from all political parties and by people from all backgrounds, by business, the trade unions and local authorities, and by all those who make up the firmament of modern Manchester and modern Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/5">I understand that the Minister will be able to say very little tonight because of his almost quasi-judicial position, but I hope he will go away and reflect on the strong case for the Manchester bid. It is a powerful bid from a city that is used to such innovation and from a city that has demonstrated in the past its capacity to work practically, not ideologically. That has seen the city transformed over the 20 years since my hon. Friend the Member for Blackley and Broughton was leader of the city council. Manchester, in transforming itself, has demonstrated the old adage that what Manchester thinks today, the rest of the world does tomorrow. If we are to make this bank a success, let us begin to think that thought in Manchester and ensure that it is a success.</p>

	<p pid="a.957.0/1">Let me start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which gives hon. Members an opportunity to extol Manchester&#8217;s virtues as the ideal home for the new green investment bank. This is not about whether I</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/2">think it is a good idea to have a green investment bank. What matters is that there is broad consensus across the parties and across all sectors in Greater Manchester that it is the best place to have the bank. There are many good reasons why it should be in Manchester&#8212;so many that we could fill a whole day&#8217;s debate with reasons&#8212;but I want to concentrate on five key areas that are crucial to this decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/3">First, locating the bank in Manchester would provide taxpayers with excellent value for money because the cost of locating it there would be far less than putting it in London. Of course, it would also help to bridge the north-south divide. Secondly, there is excellent office accommodation available and waiting in Manchester, ready for use by the bank. Thirdly, as the hon. Member for Manchester Central has mentioned, we have excellent transport links. Even with the existing rail link it is just over two hours to London, but that time will be slashed with the advent of HS2. Fourthly, it is important that the staff of the bank have experience of handling transactions of this nature, and there are people with that experience, as I shall demonstrate in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/4">Fifthly, there must be a thriving professional and financial sector. Greater Manchester has the largest number of firms in the financial and professional sector outside London and the largest legal, accounting and management consultancy sectors. The Manchester city region employs more than 50,000 people across the banking, finance and insurance sectors, and those with specialist skills are available in project finance, structured finance, and advisory and investment management. More than 60 banks are already based in Manchester, which is home to the largest United Kingdom accountancy sector outside London, and is the largest centre of mid-tier private equity in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/5">It is not good enough just to have the staff&#8212;they must also be experienced in the sort of deals that the bank will be required to carry out. In 2011, Manchester professionals in this sector conducted 620 corporate finance deals, which was an increase of 2% on the 2009 total in the north-west. There is also great experience of working in partnership across the public and private sectors, which will be of tremendous value to the green investment bank. In conclusion, I note that the Minister has been listening most attentively and although I do not expect a definite yes this evening, I trust that he will examine Manchester&#8217;s bid most carefully and will view it favourably.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-01a.958.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" speakername="Mark Prisk" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"  colnum="958"  time="020:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/debtext/120201-0004.htm#12020189003470">
	<p pid="a.958.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40386" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing the debate and commend my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40091" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)</phrase> for speaking about the importance of this institution and making the case for Manchester to be its home. The House notes that Members from across the Greater Manchester conurbation, and indeed elsewhere, have attended the debate to give their support. That is important for the bid and to put forward the case regarding this institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/2">I entirely support the argument that Manchester is a city with a strong and notable industrial heritage. I think I am right in saying that it is home to the very first</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/3">industrial canal and the world&#8217;s first railway station. Manchester has not only a long-standing role in the development of key industrial sectors&#8212;engineering and chemicals come to mind, and textiles of course, but also the electrical industries&#8212;but an important record of innovation. The hon. Member for Manchester Central pointed that out in saying that it is a city used to transformation. That is an important characteristic in this instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/4">I have to be careful, as the hon. Gentleman said. Applications closed on Monday, so he will understand that I must desist from making further remarks, positive or otherwise, about this individual case&#8212;strongly represented as it has been in tonight&#8217;s debate&#8212;because I do not want to prejudice the application in a challenging field. I am sure hon. Members will understand that.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/5">What I can say is that, throughout the country, there has been tremendous support for the bank. The hon. Gentleman said that that has involved principally those places that seek to become its home, but it has been good to see how many other areas that did not, in the end, make an application showed genuine interest. Indeed, the proposal has drawn support from across the political divide, as we have seen here this evening. We welcome that support&#8212;that enthusiasm&#8212;for the institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/6">We see the green investment bank as a key component of the transition to a sustainable economy. It should complement other policies and drive growth in the sector, which is already worth more than &#163;116 billion. This country is well placed to seize the benefits of the transition, being already the sixth largest low-carbon economic goods and services market in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/7">As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, we in this country have a wealth of expertise and many leading innovative businesses in this field which are well placed to secure their role in what will become a global market that is already estimated to be worth about &#163;3.2 trillion. There is a wide range of opportunities here. One thinks immediately of wind power, wave and tidal, building technologies and ultra-low-carbon transport. All those have a key role to play in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/8">We are committed to ensuring that UK businesses are able to seize those opportunities. That is why last summer my Department, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs together published our range of policies to support that transition to the green economy, which has been mentioned in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/9">The plans will form the basis for an important developing partnership between Government and business, but also universities and local communities, if we are to make this a lasting change. Clearly, low-carbon technologies are new&#8212;many are only nascent&#8212;so in order to invest the substantial resources required in this area, business needs to be certain that the low-carbon sector is indeed here to stay. We are doing our best, and we have taken some positive steps in providing that certainty. For example, we are committed by law to a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. We have launched the world&#8217;s first incentive scheme for renewable heat, which should increase investment in those technologies by &#163;7.5 billion by the end of this decade. We have announced the green deal, whereby householders, businesses and landlords will be able to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and their business premises at no up-front cost, instead recouping the payments through instalments on</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/10">bills. We are putting some &#163;200 million into supporting the early take-up of that, so we see that market develop and grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/11">Clearly, the transition to a green and growing economy requires unprecedented investment. For example, we think that the energy sector alone will require some &#163;200 billion. To ensure that a lack of sufficient funds does not become a barrier to the scale and pace of the transition, we recognise that we need to go beyond traditional policies. That is why we are establishing the green investment bank, which will be the first of its kind in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/12">Capitalised with &#163;3 billion, the green investment bank will complement other green policies to help to accelerate the provision of essential capital. The bank will build the kind of deep expertise in financial markets and in sustainable technologies and innovations that is vital if we are to take those bright ideas and turn them into commercial ventures. It will be a new and enduring institution, rather than a series of Government interventions, and it will address the areas of under-investment that have persisted in years past.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/13">For the benefit of Members, I will briefly explain the development of the policy and the specific issue of location. As I explained in a previous debate, the green investment bank will need to be approved by the European Commission before we can establish it as a fully independent financial institution. We expect to obtain this approval by early 2013. We recently announced that the Government are to pave the way by making investments in green infrastructure, on commercial terms, from April this year. The investments will be funded from the &#163;775 million allocation for 2012-13 made available in the Budget. The investments will be made by my Department&#8217;s UK green investments team and overseen by a new investment committee. As part of this, the Government have made available &#163;100 million for investment in waste infrastructure projects and a further &#163;100 million for investment in the non-domestic energy efficiency sector for the next financial year. We also stand ready to invest in offshore wind projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/14">Looking ahead, the green investment bank&#8217;s operational remit will be to focus on green infrastructure, which means that our initial priority sectors for investment will include offshore wind power generation; commercial and industrial waste processing and recycling; and support for the green deal. The bank will work towards a double bottom line, which in plain English means that it will achieve a significant green impact but also have to make financial returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/15">The essence of the matter we are debating is the location of the bank, which has clearly generated a lot of interest. This is the second such debate I have had the pleasure to respond to; there was another from the other side of the Pennines, but I will say no more on that, given that the majority of Members present are from the Manchester side and I do not wish to spoil the debate&#8217;s harmonious nature. Clearly the bank&#8217;s location will be crucial to its success. It will not be a vast institution&#8212;we think it will employ no more than 50 to 100 full-time equivalent staff&#8212;but it is clear, as was apparent in both speeches we heard, that people already recognise the economic value of having the organisation in their community and that it will be a genuine asset to whichever area it is located in.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/16">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-12">12 December</phrase> last year the Department published a document setting out the criteria that will be taken into account in deciding on the bank&#8217;s location. The criteria are the ability to recruit and retain the specialist staff needed to run the organisation; a location that enables the bank to work closely with other parties involved in deals as well as other investment bodies, project developers and green technology providers; and a location that provides good value for money to ensure that the bank is cost-effective. The document invited interested parties to self-assess their location against those criteria and submit relevant information for consideration. I am pleased to say that the process has been met with a powerful and positive response. Manchester was one of 32 locations across the country that submitted a self-assessment. The closing date for receipt of the assessments was Monday, which is why I am being careful not to make any prejudicial remarks on the case for Manchester, because it is important that this is done in a fair and open manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/17">All the submissions will now be reviewed against the criteria set out in the guidance document so that we can best identify the viable options, and a review panel has been established to perform the task. Advice will then</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/18">be put to the Secretary of State, who will announce his final decision in late February and outline the reasons informing his decision. The submissions will also be published at that point. In that sense, this will be an open and clear process. It will not be needlessly lengthy, but people will be able to look at how we reach the conclusion in a few weeks&#8217; time.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/19">To conclude, we are committed to taking action now to enable the transition to a green and growing economy, and we very much welcome Manchester&#8217;s contribution to that aim. We believe that we are firmly on our way to a more sustainable economy, with the policies that we have already put in place, with the strong relationship that we are building with businesses to help them to maximise the opportunities, and with a green investment bank that will be able to address the market failures affecting key infrastructure projects. To that end, I confirm that, along with the bids from other potential locations, Manchester&#8217;s application to become home to the green investment bank will be given the most careful consideration.</p>
