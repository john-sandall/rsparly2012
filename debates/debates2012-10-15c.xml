Member for Croydon North, died on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-29">29 September</phrase>. Malcolm was a popular and well-respected Member who served as Chairman of the Education Select Committee before being appointed to Government.

Sir Stuart also chaired the Finance and Services Committee and was a member of the House of Commons Commission for 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/3">I am sure that Members in all parts of the House will join me in mourning the loss of our two valued colleagues and in extending our sympathy to their wives, families and friends.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.8/1">Before I answer the question, Mr Speaker, on behalf of Members on both sides of the House, I would like to add to your tribute to Malcolm Wicks and Sir Stuart Bell. Your sentiments were very well aimed, and I am sure that all Members will support them. These were valued colleagues who will be sorely missed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.8/2">The Government implemented new family immigration rules on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-09">9 July</phrase> this year. These tackle the abuse of immigration based on sham marriages, ensure that family migrants do not become a burden on the taxpayer and promote the integration of family migrants in British society.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.9/1">May I also support the sentiments expressed by the Minister? I know that Malcolm Wicks was a fellow Wolverhampton Wanderers fan, so he was a man who always spoke incredible common sense.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.9/2">On this particular issue, many of my constituents in Wolverhampton South West express concerns about the robustness of the current entry and clearance system that operates in India. Will the Minister assure me, the House and my constituents that that system is still robust and fair and will meet the high expectations that people have of it?</p>

	<p pid="c.3.0/1">I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. Entry clearance decisions are unbiased, robust and meet the high expectations that we all have. The decisions are closely monitored by entry clearance managers and they are also inspected by the chief inspector who looks at UK Border Agency operations, both domestic and overseas.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.1/1">Many of our constituents&#8212;and, indeed, many Members&#8212;have married people from overseas. As well as appropriately tackling the abuses of the system, will the Minister ensure that there are not unnecessary and bureaucratic delays to the processing of legitimate marriages?</p>

	<p pid="c.3.2/1">Of course that is part of the task we have set out. If the hon. Gentleman has any specific cases in mind, he can raise them with me and I will see what I can do to look into them for him.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.4/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point, and he will know that I have now taken over the lead in the Home Office on combating human trafficking and related matters. We have already tackled the issue he raised to some extent, and now that he has raised it with me, I will look to see if more can be done to tackle this important issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.5/1">I, too, wholeheartedly support the comments you made, Mr Speaker, about Malcolm Wicks and Sir Stuart Bell. On the Opposition Benches we all feel that we have lost two great gentlemen from amongst our ranks. They were both intelligent men who brought a keen intelligence to the way in which they debated issues. As it happens, they were both ardent pro-Europeans, who might have had a word or two to put to the Home Secretary later this afternoon. We pay tribute to them both.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.5/2">I understand that the main reason why the Minister has introduced these recent changes to the family route provisions on immigration is to cut net migration, as the Prime Minister promised before the general election, to the tens of thousands. Will he confirm, however, that the Office for National Statistics has said that since 2010 there has been no statistically significant difference in the number of migrants to this country?</p>

	<p pid="c.3.6/1">I have seen that comment, but with a fall in net migration from 252,000 to 216,000&#8212;a fall of 15%&#8212;I will leave it to other Members and the public to judge whether they view that as significant. I know that the hon. Gentleman either tweeted or said at the Labour conference that he thought having a net migration target was &#8220;ludicrous&#8221;, but was then forced to unsay it when he was told to do so by his boss. We think having a net migration target is sensible: we mean to implement it, and I think the House will support it.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.2/1">Tackling hate crime is an issue that the Government take very seriously, and we are committed to improving the recording of such crimes. Last month the Home Office published the first set of official statistics on hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales, which will help police forces and police and crime commissioners focus resources on where they are most needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.3/1">Will the Minister join me in grimly welcoming the increase in reported disability hate crime, which is due not least to the efforts of the Government and individual Ministers to encourage an environment in which people feel able to report such crimes? That includes local initiatives such as the third-party reporting centre that we have opened in Blackpool.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.4.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0001.htm#1210154000550">
	<p pid="c.4.4/1">I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. One of the difficulties is giving people the confidence and the practical means to report hate crimes in the first place, but we are keen to encourage and facilitate that process. Of course, the level of recorded crime is sometimes higher although the baseline is the same or even falling because people are being encouraged to come forward, but we want them to come forward, and we are making it easier for them to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.6/1">As I said earlier, the Home Office has compiled statistics on recorded hate crimes in England and Wales for the first time. Only 4% of hate crimes were based on religion&#8212;the vast majority were race-based&#8212;but we take all hate crimes very seriously, and where we can further improve not only the compilation of data but the practical consequences and the way in which that information is used to tackle such crimes, we shall do so.

	<p pid="c.4.7/1">The Minister will be aware that later this week the Government will propose an amendment to the Equality Act 2010 which would remove the good-relations duty from the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

	<p pid="c.4.8/1">No, I would not draw that conclusion, but I assure the hon. Lady and every other Member that we are very serious about tackling hate crime. It takes</p>

May I therefore congratulate the Minister and the UK Border Force on a job well done in extending a warm and trouble-free welcome, without compromising border security, as the rest of the world arrived on our shores? Will he confirm that he does not view security and welcome as alternative choices to be traded off against each other, and that we can and should expect to deliver both?</p>

I am also aware that my hon. Friend is engaged in continuous discussions with Sussex police about this matter. If there is an aspect that has anything to do with changes in the law, I will of course look into it, but I also urge him to talk to the PCC candidates in his part of the world, because within a month they will be responsible for writing the policing plan for his area.</p>

It seems clear that in some parts of the country this will be a significant matter for police and crime commissioners. If the issue is causing that much public distress, it may well need to be higher up the agenda of police forces in certain areas.

	<p pid="c.18.1/1">I support the Home Secretary&#8217;s statement on Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, and the statements that she made at the time of their death. It was a brutal act. She and I are united, and I think the whole House and the whole country are united, in our tributes to those brave police officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.18.1/2">I turn to a separate issue. The Home Secretary told the Police Federation last year:</p>
	<p pid="c.18.1/3">&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to sit around with friends or, dare I say it, in the House of Commons, and criticise the police. But those people aren&#8217;t the ones confronting violent thugs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.18.1/4">She has also told it:</p>
	<p pid="c.18.1/5">&#8220;You put up with abuse and worse, but you do so to keep us free&#8230;You do an amazing job&#8212;and it&#8217;s time we gave you all the respect you deserve.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.18.1/6">I agree with her, so will she join me in condemning the Chief Whip in the House for swearing at police officers?</p>

	<p pid="c.18.2/1">I have already answered on that particular issue. I am happy to stand here and reiterate what I and others have said on a number of occasions. I believe that we have the best police officers in the world, and the Government are giving them our support. We are ensuring that we give them the tools that they need to do the job that they and the public want them to do.</p>

	<p pid="c.18.3/1">But the Home Secretary still has not condemned the Chief Whip for what he did and for the swearing&#8212;something for which people across the country are arrested. The reason why it matters that there has been no investigation and that he has not come clean is that people think it goes to the heart of the Government&#8217;s attitude towards the police and public servants. Once again, they are not listening to the police on the European arrest warrant, CCTV, DNA or the cutting of police numbers by 15,000. If the Home Secretary really wants to put an end to that and show respect for the police, why does she not change the Chief Whip and change her policies on policing too?</p>

Like the excellent Labour candidates across England and Wales outside London, I want to rescue police governance from the shambles that the Government are creating. Given that the Government pay for the free distribution of literature to electors in parliamentary elections, Welsh Assembly elections and even European elections, it is not odd that they are not doing so in PCC elections, and that the only communication will be a leaflet from the Electoral Commission about the process? Should not the Government, even at this late stage, include with that leaflet a page from each candidate standing in each police force area, so that the public know what choice they have to make?</p>

	<p pid="c.19.1/1">I say to the right hon. Gentleman that the Opposition really need to get their story straight on the cost of PCC elections. On the one hand they complain about the cost, but on the other hand they ask for the cost to go up by putting in extra provisions. I note that a number of my right hon. and hon.

	<p pid="c.19.3/1">My hon. Friend is precisely right. In areas such as Gloucestershire, striking the right balance between urban and rural pressures on the police will be an important task for the police and crime commissioner. One significant difference is that only 7% of the public are aware that they can go to a police authority if they are unhappy with their policing. By the end of this campaign, I am sure that a far higher proportion of people will be aware of their police and crime commissioner candidates.</p>

	<p pid="c.23.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-09">Tuesday 9 October</phrase> and again between <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-12">Friday 12 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-14">Sunday 14 October</phrase>, significant delays occurred at the border between Gibraltar and Spain. Travellers have been delayed by between 45 minutes and six hours as a result of more rigorous checks introduced by the Spanish Guardia Civil on vehicles leaving Gibraltar. I should say to the House that as of this afternoon, the information that I have suggests that there is a less than 20-minute wait for cars and 10-minute wait for bikes at the border.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.2/2">Spain has justified the more rigorous checks as being related to anti-tobacco smuggling operations. Tobacco smuggling does occur between Gibraltar and Spain: however, the Spanish authorities have not yet provided the Government of Gibraltar with evidence to explain why, in this case, increased checks were required.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.2/3">There have been delays at the border many times in the past, most recently in May 2012, and this current disruption comes at a time when tensions between Gibraltar and Spain have increased because of a dispute over Spanish fishing rights in British Gibraltar territorial waters. The view of many in Gibraltar is that the delays are an attempt to increase pressure on Gibraltar to resolve that fishing dispute. Gibraltar&#8217;s Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, has been critical of the delays, and the criticism of Spanish action has been shared by the ASCTEG, the association of Spanish workers who commute daily into Gibraltar.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.2/4">Disruption to border flows has a direct impact on the prosperity and well-being of communities on both sides of the border, in particular the 7,000 mostly Spanish people who travel every day from Spain to Gibraltar and back for work. The Government&#8217;s position is that these delays are unacceptable and have no place at a border between EU partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.2/5">We raised this issue over this weekend at a very high level with the Spanish Government. We will also be protesting formally to the local Guardia Civil. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take whatever action is appropriate to support the free movement of people between Gibraltar and Spain.</p>

	<p pid="c.23.3/1">I thank the Minister for his reply. Can he justify why the Spanish ambassador has not yet been summoned to the Foreign Office to explain why the border closures and incursions into Gibraltar waters are taking place? The entire policy by the Spanish is unacceptable. This is an EU border, not a third-world war zone. It is akin to the French closing the Spanish border through Andorra. The Spanish need to accept that the Gibraltar people have decided through self-determination to remain with Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.24.1/1">Although the House will appreciate that the Minister is doing all that he can in negotiations with the Spanish Government, will he agree with most Members of the House that the situation in Gibraltar is simply unacceptable? While people in Madrid may give assurances that the Spanish Government are acting in a way that is acceptable to the UK Government, what actually happens day to day is that the Guardia Civil under local management in Algeciras and La L&#237;nea do whatever they wish, not only on the border but in making incursions by sea into British Gibraltar territorial waters whenever they wish to do so and in a way that is deliberately designed to make life difficult for the people and Government of Gibraltar. If the Minister can assure the House that he understands that and will make it clear to the Government of Spain, we will be happy.</p>

	<p pid="c.24.2/1">Where there is a genuine case for increased checks at the border because of an acknowledged need to combat smuggling or other criminal activity, that might be fair. In such a case, however, we would expect the Spanish authorities to be open with the Government of Gibraltar about those circumstances, but that has not been the case hitherto in this instance.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.2/2">So far as maritime incursions are concerned, we are absolutely confident of the United Kingdom&#8217;s sovereignty over British Gibraltar territorial waters, which is why the Royal Navy challenges Guardia Civil and other Spanish state vessels whenever they make unlawful maritime incursions into British Gibraltar territorial waters. We back that up through formal diplomatic protests to the Spanish Government about all unlawful incursions. Those challenges and protests make it clear that such incursions are an unacceptable violation of British sovereignty.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40316" name="Jim Dobbin">the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase> on securing this important urgent question. The Opposition continue to support the self-determination of the Gibraltan people and their right to remain under British sovereignty, as we did in government, so I welcome the Minister&#8217;s answer on that. We also welcome the fact that Chief Minister Fabian Picardo, who is in London today, has been in touch with the Government and that discussions have taken place between the Minister for Europe and the Gibraltan Chief Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/2">I agree that the delays of up to five or six hours at the border between Spain and Gibraltar are simply unacceptable, and I welcome the Minister&#8217;s discussions with the Gibraltan Chief Minister. I echo his observation that this is also of deep concern to the thousands of Spanish workers who cross the border every day to work in Gibraltar. What more can the Government do to ensure that these delays do not happen again, and that the reasons given in this and other instances by the Spanish Government are properly investigated and that evidence is produced for what many think are just excuses? Finally, what discussions has the Minister had with the Spanish Government about their decision to</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/3">abandon the trilateral forum, and what pressure is he and the Foreign Secretary exerting on the Spanish Government to return to it?</p>

	<p pid="c.25.0/1">I agree with the hon. Lady that the border delays end up penalising Spanish workers as much as the people of Gibraltar. The delays get in the way of sensible economic relations between Gibraltar and the neighbouring regions of Spain, and therefore interrupt what ought to be a mutually beneficial economic relationship. They harm jobs and hopes of prosperity. We shall continue to raise with the Spanish authorities at every appropriate level cases where we think that the border delays that have been imposed have not been adequately justified. The Government of Gibraltar regularly co-operate with Spain in tackling tobacco smuggling and other forms of criminal activity. That is the sort of sensible, constructive co-operation we want.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/2">The British Government very much regret that the current Spanish Government refuse to take part in further meetings of the trilateral, which we believe well serves both Gibraltar and Spain, as well as the United Kingdom. We would like some kind of equivalent collaborative system established, but so far Spain has refused to return to the trilateral. I am grateful for what the hon. Lady said about her support for British sovereignty over Gibraltar and respecting the rights of its people. I particularly welcome her remarks, if they mark a break with the proposals for shared sovereignty and the betrayal of the people of Gibraltar that the Labour party supported when in office.</p>

	<p pid="c.25.1/1">We are grateful to Ministers for their robust view on this matter. There is a strong view in Gibraltar that since the Government changed in Madrid there has been a much less obvious willingness to collaborate with the Government of Gibraltar, as well as incursions into our waters and regular blockages of the border. Will Ministers put it on the agenda for the next meeting with Madrid that the way for a civilised Government in Spain to behave, if they want to make a joint effort on the border, is to warn Gibraltar, do it together and stop this uncivilised and tribal attitude from a country that wants to be regarded as a full and civilised member of the EU?</p>

	<p pid="c.25.2/1">My right hon. Friend makes a very good point about the beneficial effect of practical co-operation between the Governments of Spain and Gibraltar, a subject that is frequently on the agenda in discussions between the British and Spanish sides. It is fair to say that although the new Spanish Government have introduced a policy towards the trilateral which we have found unwelcome&#8212;they know that that is our attitude towards their policy&#8212;the Prime Minister of Spain has also made it clear publicly that he does not want the argument about Gibraltar to get in the way of a fruitful bilateral relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom.

	<p pid="c.27.2/1">The allegations emerging around Jimmy Savile are absolutely horrifying. My thoughts are with those affected and their families who have suffered in silence for decades. I believe that it is absolutely right that the BBC asked the police first and foremost to investigate these allegations, and that it has waited to act, on the advice of the police, before launching its own inquiries. It is essential that the police inquiry is not disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="c.27.2/2">The BBC is a globally admired British institution and has a unique place in our cultural life. As such, it is imperative that it behaves in a manner that makes it worthy of the public&#8217;s ongoing trust and confidence. Both the Prime Minister and I said last week that we believed that the BBC should investigate these very serious allegations. The BBC Trust is there to represent the interests of licence fee payers: it must investigate these matters and rectify them, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.27.2/3">Following the board meeting on Friday, I called both the director-general and the chair of the BBC Trust to underline how vital it is to have clear terms of reference in place and for there to be an announcement of who will chair the inquiries as soon as possible. From those conversations, I am now confident that both the BBC and the BBC Trust are taking these allegations very seriously indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.27.2/4">As the House will be aware, the BBC has launched three separate investigations. The first review will look into the allegations with regard to the item on Savile which was inappropriately pulled from &#8220;Newsnight&#8221;. The second review, to be undertaken when the police advise it is appropriate to do so, will focus on Jimmy Savile himself. Thirdly, although the BBC&#8217;s child protection policy was overhauled in 2002, the review will also focus on whether its policy is fit for purpose and what lessons can be learned. This review will be assisted by an independent expert. An additional piece of work will look at the very troubling allegations of sexual harassment at the BBC that have come to light in recent weeks. The director-general will give further details later in the week. These are undoubtedly very serious matters, which have wide-ranging implications for a number of public institutions&#8212;not just the BBC. It is now crucial that we understand what went wrong and how it can be put right.</p>

	<p pid="c.27.3/1">I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.27.3/2">Other institutions besides the BBC&#8212;including hospitals, children&#8217;s homes, the Crown Prosecution Service and even the police&#8212;appear to have serious questions to answer, and I am pushing for answers on those, too, but the BBC currently faces more questions than others because many of the alleged acts of sexual abuse and paedophilia happened on BBC premises and Savile was a BBC employee. While many of these questions relate to the past, there are very serious questions about the</p>
	<p pid="c.27.3/3">actions of the BBC in the present. Any hint of a cover-up by the BBC of its own role in this dreadful affair will cause huge damage to public and audience trust. We do not have an explanation of why the BBC scrapped the &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; investigation entirely rather than give it more time to develop its work, or of why the BBC did not pass on to police at the time new claims it had obtained about Savile and two other living celebrities who are still at large having allegedly abused under-age girls on BBC premises?</p>
	<p pid="c.27.3/4">I have a number of major concerns that the inquiries announced by the BBC will not be sufficiently independent, transparent or robust to give the public confidence. I shall write to Dame Fiona Reynolds this afternoon to set out those concerns in detail. In the light of these concerns, I ask whether my right hon. Friend is concerned that the BBC has been slow to react to the growing scandal, and that by dragging its feet on the need for a proper independent inquiry on its own conduct, it has appeared as though it does not want to get to the bottom of this matter. Does she think the BBC&#8217;s arrangements for two inquiries are sufficiently independent, transparent and comprehensive? Does she think that a separate, rapid inquiry into the cancellation of the &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; story is justified? In view of the wider questions about the role of other institutions, does she think that a wider public inquiry into the whole affair would be justified? Finally, is my right hon. Friend concerned that the BBC Trust has acted more as a cheerleader and defender of the BBC than as a critical guardian of standards? Does she think the current relationship is fit for purpose?</p>

	<p pid="c.28.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to cover some of the issues that he has raised. I spoke to both the director-general and the chairman of the BBC Trust after the board meeting on Friday, and I feel that they are taking these matters extremely seriously indeed. I would underline that point to my hon. Friend. Ultimately, it is for the BBC Trust to have the confidence of the licence fee payer and the comfort confidence of the British public. It is therefore vital for all the inquiries to be undertaken in a transparent and independent manner, and I think that the involvement of Dame Fiona Reynolds as the trust&#8217;s senior independent director designate will reassure us in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.0/2">As for the role of a wider inquiry, my hon. Friend should bear in mind that a police investigation is currently taking place. I think everyone would agree that it is important for the individuals who have been victims to know that that investigation can proceed unfettered, and that that should be our priority at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="c.28.1/1">I support what the Secretary of State has said. Everyone has been sickened by the vile abuse perpetrated by Jimmy Savile, and it is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those whom he abused. What has deepened the revulsion is that this happened at the BBC, an institution so loved and trusted that it is known as &#8220;Auntie&#8221;. That has cast a stain on the BBC.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.1/2">Does the Secretary of State agree that no one should be complacent and believe that sexual abuse by people in positions of power at the BBC happened then, but could not happen now? The BBC should proceed now to review all its policies and processes on the protection</p>
	<p pid="c.28.1/3">of children, sexual harassment and whistleblowing, in order to be sure that the right policies and processes are in place and are properly enforced. That need not wait for the police investigation. Does the Secretary of State agree that it must apply to all employees, including those at the very top&#8212;the senior executives and the top talent? Clearly it was Jimmy Savile&#8217;s exalted celebrity status that gave him a sense of impunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.1/4">I strongly support the Secretary of State&#8217;s recognition that people will want to be confident that the inquiries that the BBC is setting up will be genuinely independent, and that they will want to know when those inquiries can be established and when reports on them will be issued. I also support the recognition by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40492" name="Rob Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading East (Mr Wilson)</phrase> that this goes wider than just the BBC, and that there are still countless young women and men who have been abused but have never complained because they bear a great burden of shame, guilt and disgust, and fear that they will not be believed. Should not our strong and clear message to them today be &#8220;Come forward now, seek the support that you need to address the wrong that has been done to you, and, in doing so, not only secure the justice that you deserve but protect others in the future&#8221;?</p>

I know that when we have discussed this matter in Committees of the House, we have stressed the importance of vigilance as well as checking. A vigilant culture in our corporations is vital.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.0/2">The BBC undertook a root-and-branch review of its child protection policies in 2002, and made significant changes. Having looked at those changes over the last few days, I can see why they are held up as an exemplar in their field, but the right hon. and learned Lady is right to say that we need to reconsider. We must leave no stone unturned in ensuring that such appalling situations cannot arise again. Child abuse can have nowhere to live at any level in an organisation.</p>

The revelations of recent weeks raise serious questions, not just about the culture that existed in the BBC some years ago&#8212;and in other organisations&#8212;but about the way in which the BBC has handled the matter, and in particular the very damaging suggestion that the &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; investigation was suppressed.

I can reassure her that the BBC&#8217;s own child protection policy goes beyond that which is required, and it is expected that where people work with children and young people the role will be subject to a satisfactory Criminal Records Bureau check or indeed a PVG&#8212;Protecting Vulnerable Groups scheme&#8212;check. She is right always to be questioning whether we do have the right checks in place, but I say to her that the individual we are talking about today had no criminal convictions. So this is not just about looking at convictions; it is also about the culture of vigilance that I talked about when responding to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40140" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.30.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that these latest sickening revelations just reinforce the sobering message that child sexual exploitation is rife in every community, every organisation and every social class, whether it is hiding behind the culture of celebrity in the BBC and other institutions, behind the culture of fear within the Church or behind the culture of political correctness that prevents the police and social services from properly investigating when cultural sensitivities are involved?

I agree with him that the seriousness of the situation is something that all the organisations that have been implicated need to look at. I reassure him that the police investigating the Savile inquiry are working with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to try to ensure that people who have been affected are forthcoming with evidence and that we can get to the root of this problem.</p>

	<p pid="c.33.2/1">My hon. Friend is right that we have to ensure that there is that challenge, and ultimately that is the role of the trust, which represents the licence fee payer and must make sure it holds the executive to account. My predecessor introduced a number of changes to the trust&#8217;s role. We will continue to look at that role and, as we move towards charter renewal, it will of course be hotly in our sights.</p>

	<p pid="c.34.6/1">May I start by apologising to the shadow Secretary of State for the fact that she received a copy of my statement late? On one occasion, when I was shadowing Stephen Byers and he was due to make a statement in the House, I was in a similar position, so I know the difficulties that the situation causes.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/2">Under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, the Government are required to decide by 2014 whether we opt out of, or remain bound by, all the EU police and criminal justice measures adopted prior to the treaty&#8217;s entry into force. Under the treaty, the Government are required to make a final decision by <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-31">31 May 2014</phrase>, with that decision taking effect on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-01">1 December</phrase> that year. Although that might seem a long way off, the process of decision making, as with many EU matters, is complicated. We wish to ensure that, before that point, we give the House and the other place sufficient time to consider this important matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/3">In total, more than 130 measures within the scope of the decision are to be considered at this stage. A full list of the measures was provided to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-21">21 December</phrase> last year and a further update was given on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-18">18 September</phrase> this year. The Government are clear</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/4">that we do not need to remain bound by all the pre-Lisbon measures. Operational experience shows that some of the pre-Lisbon measures are useful, that some are less so and that some are now, in fact, entirely defunct.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/5">Under the terms of the treaty, however, the UK cannot pick and choose the measures from which we wish to opt out; we can opt out only en masse and then seek to rejoin individual measures. So I can announce today that the Government&#8217;s current thinking is that we will opt out of all pre-Lisbon police and criminal justice measures and then negotiate with the Commission and other member states to opt back into those individual measures that it is in our national interest to rejoin. However, discussions are ongoing within the Government and therefore no formal notification will be given to the Council until we have reached agreement on the measures that we wish to opt back into.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/6">This Government, more than any other before them, have done their utmost to ensure that Parliament has the time to scrutinise properly our decisions relating to the European Union and that Parliament&#8217;s views are taken into account. I assure the House that the 2014 decision will be no exception. As the Minister for Europe has already told the House, the Government are committed to a vote on the matter in both this House and the other place. We are also committed to consulting the European Affairs, Home Affairs and Justice Committees, as well as the European Scrutiny Committee and the House of Lords European Union Committee, on the arrangements for the vote.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/7">I fully expect that those Committees will want to undertake their own work on this important decision. The Government will take account of the Committees&#8217; overall views of the package that the UK should seek to apply to rejoin. So that the Government can do that, I invite the Committees to begin work, including gathering evidence, shortly, and to provide their recommendations to the Government as soon as possible. The Government will then aim to bring forward a vote in both Houses of Parliament. The time frame for the vote will depend on progress in our discussions with the Commission and Council. An update will be provided to Parliament early in the new year on when we can expect the vote to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.6/8">I hope that today I have conveyed to the House not only the Government&#8217;s full commitment to holding a vote on the 2014 decision in this House and the other place, but the importance that we will accord to Parliament in the process leading up to that vote. I am sure that all parties will want to work together to ensure that the final decision is in the UK&#8217;s national interest. It is in the national interest that the Government have taken this decision, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.36.2/1">The European arrest warrant started out as a very good idea but has ended up with chaotic and unfair consequences, and the Home Secretary is quite right not to opt into those arrangements. When she considers the areas where she can opt in, which she said she would do seriously, will she look at the powers and responsibilities of Europol? It is very important that we have cross-border co-operation with our EU partners so that violent criminals who may have committed offences abroad are not allowed to enter the United Kingdom. I will put her suggestion of a Select Committee inquiry to the Home Affairs Committee tomorrow.</p>

I am talking not about individual measures, but simply about the Government&#8217;s proposal that we opt out of, and then negotiate on, a number of measures.

	<p pid="c.36.5/1">It is absolutely right that there are criminal offences where we want to be able to extradite people&#8212;to bring people back from other countries to face trial and justice here in the United Kingdom. We need to ensure that the arrangements that enable us to do that are the best possible and are proportionate. Proportionality is one of the issues that have been raised as regards relations with Europe. As I say, we will look at every individual measure separately when choosing whether to request to opt in.</p>

	<p pid="c.36.6/1">I have never been in this situation before whereby I have not had a copy of the statement from the Minister</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/2">until I arrived in the Chamber. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for taking my point of order about this earlier. It shows the complete confusion in the Government and on the part of the Home Secretary about what the Government&#8217;s policy is. They have not told us anything at all today; they are completely confused.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/3">We all know that with more international travel and growing cross-border crime, international co-operation is an extremely serious matter, yet the Government seem to have an utterly chaotic position. The Prime Minister told us that the Government would be opting out of all the justice and home affairs provisions; the Deputy Prime Minister said, &#8220;No, no&#8212;we are only minded to do so.&#8221; The Home Secretary said that she was simply setting out &#8220;the Government&#8217;s current thinking&#8221;. However, as she also said that &#8220;discussions are ongoing&#8221;, presumably the current thinking could change tomorrow and then it will be something else entirely. She said that she wants to opt out of some things but then might opt back into everything all over again. It is just like the Education Secretary saying that he wants out of Europe and the Prime Minister wanting in. With all this out and in, in and out, it is as though the Government are playing a giant game of hokey cokey&#8212;and yet the fight against crime is at stake.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/4">The Home Secretary will know that former Metropolitan police commissioners and former heads of MI5 and MI6 have said that British law enforcement bodies are now constantly communicating, co-operating and collaborating with the EU in pursuing serious organised criminal and terrorist networks. The framework of co-operation that they have is crucial in order to stop criminals and prevent crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/5">We have read much in the papers about the European arrest warrant, but the Home Secretary did not say whether she wants to opt out of it or plans to opt back in. This warrant made it possible to arrest Jeremy Forrest and bring him back to face British justice for the alleged kidnapping of Megan Stammers and to bring back Hussain Osman for trying to bomb the London underground, and it closed down the &#8220;Costa del Crime&#8221; when British criminals fled to Spain.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/6">We have a right to be able to bring those criminals back to face British justice, and we owe it to their victims &#8212;and, yes, that does mean sending people back from Britain to other countries, because of the 4,000 people returned from Britain in the past eight years under the European arrest warrant, 95% were foreign citizens, who often had committed crimes in their home countries and fled here to escape the long arm of the law. I am sorry, but I think that people should be sent back to their home countries to face justice, rather than have too many people who are suspected of serious crimes in Europe wandering around Britain, unable to be sent back to face justice without years of legal wrangles. From what the Home Secretary has said today, she may well be opting out of the European arrest warrant, which prevents that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/7">Another area is the sharing of criminal and DNA records. If a known sex offender travels to Britain from France or Spain, does the Home Secretary think that we need full access to their DNA and their criminal records or not?</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/8">What about minimum standards of counter-terror co-operation, participating in Europol and exchanging information to stop passport fraud and Europe-wide money laundering, and to trace and freeze criminal</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/9">assets? The Home Secretary has not told us her position on any of those important measures. She has not said whether she thinks we should opt out, opt out and then opt back in again, whether she thinks that we should renegotiate the provisions, or what will be put in their place in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/10">The Home Secretary knows that there is no guarantee that the European Commission and other European countries will support our opting back in again. For example, Denmark, which has opted out from the justice and home affairs provisions, has had about 50% of its requests turned down. One of the Home Secretary&#8217;s junior Ministers has admitted that there will be a financial penalty for opting out and then opting back in. Does she have any idea what that financial penalty will be and whether it is worth the price?</p>
	<p pid="c.36.6/11">I say to the Home Secretary that this is an utterly confused position. Her defence is that she wants to consult Parliament and the public but, considering she has utterly failed to consult Parliament and provide the Opposition with proper information, that is ridiculous. She is taking big risks without even working out what her views are or what the Government think. Next time they want to make a statement on important European policy, perhaps they should work out what they actually think it should be before they come to the House and make it.</p>

	<p pid="c.38.0/1">Let us remember that it was the Labour party that wanted to sign up to the European constitution and that planned to scrap the pound and join the euro. It has no credibility on European issues in this House. Indeed, it has no credibility with the British people.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/2">Let me address the right hon. Lady&#8217;s points. On the list of measures that we might want to opt back into, I have made it clear that we need to engage with the European Commission and other member states in order to opt back into measures where we believe it is in the national interest to do so. That negotiation can now start. We will do that in earnest and talk to them about the terms on which particular opt-ins might be possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/3">The right hon. Lady seems to be concerned about where the opt-out decision might leave us with regard to public protection. I remind her that it was the previous Government who negotiated the opt-out. If they thought it was such a problem, why did they negotiate it in the first place? On costs, I remind the right hon. Lady that the financial penalty was part of that negotiation of the opt-out, so it was the Labour Government who signed up to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/4">The right hon. Lady made a number of comments on the European arrest warrant. She will be aware that a number of Members have raised concerns about British nationals, some of whom are their constituents, spending a long time languishing in foreign jails before reaching trial. A number of issues have been raised in this House and elsewhere about the proportionality issue in relation to the European arrest warrant. I therefore ask the right hon. Lady: is she happy with all of that, or does she think that the situation can be changed? If she does not think that there is an issue with the European arrest warrant, why did she not force a Division and vote against last December&#8217;s motion on extradition, which included a proposal to reform and amend the European arrest warrant? She did not. She accepted the motion, which this House passed and which stated that amendments should be made to the European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/5">The right hon. Lady&#8217;s only position on the issue seems to be to disagree with what we say and what we do. The Labour party negotiated an opt-out, but now it is against enacting it. It said that we needed to reform the European arrest warrant, but now it wants to pass up on the chance of doing just that. I have set out the Government&#8217;s position this afternoon. We will give Parliament a voice on the issue. The right hon. Lady cannot spend her time saying one thing one day and another thing the next and expect to be taken credibly by this House or anybody else.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for making clear the position on whether we will exercise the opt-out or the opt-in, which is a necessary first position to take. I also thank her for enabling Parliament to exercise its proper influence over the individual measures that we may wish to opt into. Why that is difficult for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> to understand escapes me.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/2">I know that the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary will agree that it is clearly in our national interest to get European Union prisoners who are serving their sentence here transferred to their own country as early as possible to serve their sentence there. Within the remit of the proper parliamentary scrutiny that she is seeking, will she give the earliest possible indication to our European partners that we will seek to continue with those arrangements?</p>

	<p pid="c.39.1/1">I assure my hon. Friend that I and the Justice Secretary have every bit as much interest as he has in ensuring that prisoner transfers are made as quickly as possible. He is again trying to tempt me down a road that I will not go down. We have been clear that we will start to look at the individual measures in negotiation with the Commission and member states to see what process will be required and on what terms it might be possible to opt into the measures that we want to opt into. So far, that process has not started.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.2/1">The Home Secretary knows that she does not have to opt out of the European arrest warrant to seek its reform in areas such as proportionality. That work is already going on in Europe because many countries share our concern. She has the benefit of the report by Lord Justice Scott Baker, which she commissioned. Will she confirm that the Scott Baker report strongly recommended remaining in the European arrest warrant because it had made huge strides forward on justice and tackling crime in Europe?</p>

	<p pid="c.40.1/1">I have never heard a statement so heavily spun to the press, but so devoid of content when the Minister rises at the Dispatch Box. Is not the Secretary of State opting into the rampant Europhobia that consumes her party, in a competition with the Education Secretary to get us out of Europe?

	<p pid="c.40.2/1">I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I take the protection of the British public very seriously indeed. It is the first duty of government to protect the public, but we need to ensure that any measures that are in place to protect the public are the right ones. I have not said what we will do on the European arrest warrant, but I have noted the concerns that have rightly been raised about its proportionality and in relation to the cases of some UK citizens who have been in jail elsewhere. We will now start to look at the individual measures. As I have said, we will discuss with member states and the Commission the process by which we will be able to opt into certain measures, where we choose to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.3/1">My right hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the fact that in some countries, such as France, United Kingdom citizens have been held for long periods without trial, in clear breach of the convention on human rights. Is it not absolutely correct, therefore, that before we go any further down this road, the House should have the opportunity to consider carefully and vote on any extension or further joining of the European arrest warrant?</p>

	<p pid="c.40.5/1">Many of the crimes considered most serious by any normal standard are international in type, including the trafficking of drugs and of people, including children, and banking and corporate fraud. Bearing that in mind, does the Home Secretary truly believe that it is in the interests of justice to opt out of scores of cross-border EU justice measures not knowing if and when future opt-ins will succeed?</p>

	<p pid="c.40.6/1">As I have made clear, it is not open to us to opt out of individual measures. The last Government negotiated a block opt-out, with a right to opt into</p>
	<p pid="c.40.6/2">certain measures following negotiation with the Commission and member states. We intend to follow that process.</p>
	<p pid="c.40.6/3">The right hon. Gentleman talks about cross-border crime, which is significant. The drugs that are being peddled on the streets and lead to petty crime are being brought across the border by organised crime gangs. That is why we are setting up the National Crime Agency, which will include a border policing command and will have an enhanced ability to deal with serious and organised crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.41.0/2">Will my right hon. Friend reassure the House that as she goes through the 130 measures in question, she will examine all options for co-operation, whether they are formally opting back in or alternatives such as co-operating under a memorandum of understanding or ad hoc co-operation? That would broaden the scope and potential for practical co-operation without ceding democratic authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.41.2/1">Will the Home Secretary clarify what will happen in the period between the opt-out and the reintroduction of some, but fewer, measures?

	<p pid="c.41.3/1">We expect that transitional arrangements will be available, but one point of taking the decision now and announcing what we propose is that we can work with the European Commission to ensure that the time period between the opt-out being exercised and our coming back into any measures is as short as possible. The question of how that will work will be part of the negotiations with member states.</p>

	<p pid="c.41.4/1">I congratulate the Home Secretary on her announcement. It is crystal clear what she wants to do, which is to protect the sovereignty of this country, unlike the Labour party. Does she agree that Labour has no credibility on this issue? It negotiated this opt-out, and it is complaining now that we are attempting to use it.</p>
	<p pid="c.41.4/2">Furthermore, does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a serious proportionality problem with the European arrest warrant? It is exemplified by a case from Poland in which an individual is alleged to have stolen a wheelbarrow with a value of &#163;30. The proceedings for extradition from this country cost &#163;30,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.42.0/1">The Home Secretary may have persuaded herself, and perhaps even some of her colleagues, that she has adopted a sophisticated position, but I tell her that confusion is the friend of the criminal. I, for one, am deeply concerned about this hokey-cokey approach to justice in this country and across Europe, especially on such deeply serious issues as organised crime, child abuse online and drug and people trafficking. Any sense of confusion is deeply worrying.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.0/2">Although <i>The Sunday </i> <i>Telegraph </i>might have sought to trivialise some European arrest warrant cases, I remind the Home Secretary, as did my right hon.

	<p pid="c.42.1/1">I fully understand the cases cited by the right hon. Gentleman, and others, in relation to this matter. On the other hand, however, concerns have been raised about proportionality in relation to the European arrest warrant. That is why it is right for the Government to sit down and look carefully at this issue, and take a decision on the European arrest warrant and the terms under which it might be possible to opt in. Part of the negotiations with the European Commission and member states is precisely about those terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.1/2">I say to the right hon. Gentleman, and to others, that his Government negotiated an opt-out, so he cannot stand there and complain when the current Government propose to exercise it.</p>

Jeremy Forrest, the teacher, was returned to the UK less than two weeks later to face trial. They were found in Bordeaux by police acting on a European arrest warrant issued three days previously. Without the EAW, it is likely that it would have taken longer to find Megan, and Jeremy Forrest would probably still be in France. What reassurance can the Secretary of State give to my constituent and her family, and thousands of other victims of serious cross-border crime, that the Government will always ensure that British police can work effectively with their European partners to catch criminals abroad and bring them back quickly to face British justice in our courts?</p>

We recognise the importance of co-operating with other police forces in other jurisdictions in other countries so that we can ensure that people face justice appropriately. These issues, in cases such as the one that he raises, will of course be considered by the Government in looking at the whole question of the European arrest warrant.</p>

	West Coast Main Line
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.46.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40203" speakername="Patrick McLoughlin" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="46"  time="016:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0002.htm#1210154000796">
	<p pid="c.46.1/1">With permission, I would like to make a statement on the west coast main line. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-03">Wednesday 3 October</phrase>, I announced the cancellation of the inter-city west coast franchise procurement. This decision was taken as the result of significant flaws found within the procurement process undertaken by my Department. These made the continuation of the competition and the award of the franchise untenable.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/2">I know how important the west coast main line is to the economy of this country and to the constituents of Members. This franchise operates more than 300 train services a day, carries more than 26 million passengers a year and employs more than 3,000 staff. This is a regrettable outcome caused by unacceptable mistakes made in my Department during a complex procurement process. It has also meant that I have paused the ongoing franchising programme, including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/3">I would like to reiterate that there is no suggestion that FirstGroup or any of the other bidders, including Virgin Trains, acted in anything other than good faith during the bidding process. FirstGroup is a great British company and a leading transport operator both here and in the United States. It provides jobs for 13,000 people across the UK and operates four railway franchises, which together carry more than 300 million passengers a year. I want to make it clear today that the cancellation of the west coast competition should not be seen as a comment on FirstGroup, its bid, or its approach to running rail franchises now or in the future. Furthermore, as I have said to the Select Committee on Transport, Virgin has also made a fantastic contribution to both the railways and aviation in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/4">It would be premature at this stage to speculate on where and how the errors in the process emerged. That is why, when I announced the cancellation of the procurement, I also asked for two urgent investigations to be carried out. Both reviews are now well under way. The first of these is an inquiry led by Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica. He is the lead non-executive director on procurement across Government and the lead non-executive director of the departmental board. His review is examining what happened during the west coast procurement and why. It will establish the lessons to be learned. I have asked for the initial findings of the review by the end of October and expect the full report by the end of November.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/5">The second review is looking at the implications of the flaws on the west coast procurement for the rest of the franchising programme. This review is being led by Richard Brown, a highly respected industry figure and the chairman of Eurostar. My expectation is that the Brown review will report no later than the end of the year on lessons for the future franchising programme, so that it can be resumed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/6">I am today publishing the terms of reference for both reviews, and these have already been laid in the Library of the House. Before these reviews have been completed, and particularly before the findings of the Laidlaw review have been published, any speculation as to the nature of the flaws is just that&#8212;speculation. I will of course report to the House on the findings of these reviews at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/7">I would like to take this opportunity, however, to restate the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that we continue to have private sector innovation and investment in the railways. Since privatisation, the number of passenger miles travelled has nearly doubled. This growth brings significant benefits to the country&#8217;s economy and to the environment, relieving congestion and improving connectivity for businesses, commuters and leisure travellers. Passenger satisfaction is up, and so is punctuality. I want to see these benefits continue, which is why I want this pause, while the reviews are carried out, to be as short as possible. We will restart our refranchising programme, including the competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink, as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/8">I now turn to the future operation of the west coast main line. I am committed to ensuring that passengers will see no impact as a result of these mistakes. Passengers will be able to make the journeys they have planned, with the tickets that they have bought. Clearly, we will need to learn lessons from the two reviews, and we will need to run a new competition for the west coast franchise. I want this to happen as quickly as possible, but we want to get it right, which will take time. It is also important that in the intervening period we secure a deal that secures best value for taxpayers, including the continual improvement of service quality.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/9">For that reason, I am today announcing that we are commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group with a view to it remaining as operator of passenger services on the west coast main line. Subject to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, I expect this to last for a short period of about nine to 13 months. In this period, we will run a competition for an interim agreement. This interim agreement, which will be open to any bidders, will then run until the new long-term west coast franchise is ready to commence. I will keep this approach under review so that it can be informed by the Brown findings and recommendations and so that it will ensure value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.1/10">I am grateful to the team at Directly Operated Railways for all their preparations so far. DOR will continue to stand ready should it be required. Britain&#8217;s railways are a great success, and I am determined that this incident will not get in the way of the Government&#8217;s record. We have launched the biggest programme of investment since the Victorian era and have just announced reductions in regulated fare rises over the next two years, recognising the importance of access to the railways for millions of commuters. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.47.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for advanced view of the statement. I well understand why, when he announced this embarrassing debacle earlier this month, he did so at one minute past midnight, when he hoped everybody would be asleep, because this is yet another staggering example of the monumental incompetence of this shambles of a Government. It is a failure of policy, a failure of process, a failure of ministerial oversight and a failure of ministerial leadership.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/2">The Government&#8217;s new franchising policy, which requires risks to be calculated 15 years into the future, was designed by the current Secretary of State for Northern</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/3">Ireland, announced by the current Secretary of State for Defence and implemented by the current Secretary of State for International Development; and it has shamefully been left to the former Chief Whip to try and deflect the blame for it on to three officials in the Department for Transport. It is just as well it has not been left to the current Chief Whip to deal with, or he would probably have blamed it on the police at the gates of Downing street.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/4">The reality is that Ministers are responsible. It was Ministers who redesigned franchising policy to make it much more difficult to calculate which bidder should win. It was Ministers who slashed faster than any other Department the expertise and staffing available to carry out the task, including apparently making the director of procurement, the director of rail strategy and the director of rail contracts&#8217; posts redundant along with those of senior finance staff; and it was Ministers who reportedly cancelled an external audit that was routinely done in other competitions to check the outcome of the franchise award ahead of its announcement.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/5">It is incredible that Minsters continue to maintain that these problems only came to light late in the day, just before they made that midnight announcement less than two weeks ago. We know that Ministers were sent a report warning of precisely the problems that led to the competition being cancelled five days before the contract was awarded. Today was the opportunity for the new Secretary of State to begin to put things right, yet he has failed his first test and announced a way forward that adds to the chaos and confusion and risks even greater costs to taxpayers, replacing one franchise competition with three, opening up the prospect of three owners in three years, increasing the risk of further legal action and further costs to taxpayers, and adding to the uncertainty for passengers and staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/6">Can the Secretary of State update the House on the likely final cost to taxpayers of the Government&#8217;s failure on franchising? If reimbursing bidders for the west coast will cost &#163;40 million, what will be the costs of the stalled Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink franchises? What legal advice did he receive on his decision to extend Virgin&#8217;s contract? Specifically, what advice has he received on EU competition law, procurement law and the impact on the fairness of future competitions for the franchise? In the light of this debacle, does he agree that it makes sense to maintain a public sector rail company that is equipped to step in at short notice in future, as well as providing a useful comparator? Will he therefore abandon the planned privatisation of the east coast service, which is delivering nearly &#163;200 million back to taxpayers every year, which is profit that in future will be shared with shareholders?</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/7">Can the Secretary of State not see that it is completely inappropriate for a member of his own Department&#8217;s board, no matter what his other qualities are, to carry out an investigation that has to look at the decisions taken or approved by other members of that board, including Ministers? Will the Secretary of State think again and make his review truly independent? What impact has the 37% turnover of senior civil servants in the restructuring of the Department in the last two years had on its capability to conduct competitions such as this? As the Secretary of State mentioned his fares U-turn, will he now agree to make the train</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/8">companies apply the cap to every route, so that passengers do not find, as they did last year, that fares may still rise by up to 5% above the cap?</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/9">This was a franchise fiasco made by Ministers&#8212;a policy scribbled on the back of an envelope in opposition; cuts that go too far, too fast, implemented in government. The result is chaos across the rail industry and tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money down the drain&#8212;the direct consequence of decisions taken by Ministers. Now we have a proposal for an independent review that is not independent at all, while the Secretary of State&#8217;s solution to the west coast franchise fiasco is a decision to do it all over again&#8212;that is, twice in just two years. What an appalling waste of taxpayers&#8217; money! What a shambles from this incompetent Government!</p>

	<p pid="c.49.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her reasoned response to my statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/2">The last Labour Secretary of State for Transport was not a Member of this House, but he said some very interesting things. Lord Adonis said:</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/3">&#8220;Ten year franchises, with the possibility of longer contracts should bidders make sensible and affordable proposals, will allow operators to invest and suggest new innovations.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/4">At that point the Labour party increased the minimum for franchises to run to 10 years, with an option of 22 years. There is therefore a long-standing position that longer franchises can work, including to the benefit of passengers, which it is important they should do.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/5">The hon. Lady mentioned a number of points. One of the things that I was keen to do, on hearing of the problems we were facing in the Department, was to get to the answers as quickly as possible. That is why I set up the inquiries as quickly as I possibly could. I believe that Mr Laidlaw is perfectly capable of bringing his expertise to bear and showing us&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The hon. Lady ought to wait until he has done the inquiry before prejudging it, because at least we have taken the action to get the inquiry under way. I think that is the right way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.0/6">The hon. Lady talks about the reduction in members of staff in the Department. There has indeed been a reduction. Bearing in mind the economic climate in which we found ourselves, that was absolutely necessary and I make no apologies whatever for that. I am determined to see that the provision of services to the customers who use the west coast main line&#8212;of which there are many, with many constituencies involved&#8212;is carried out continuously, and that is why I believe Virgin are the best people to carry that forward.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.1/1">The House is grateful to my right hon. Friend for coming here at the earliest opportunity to explain what has gone wrong and to describe the action that he proposes to take. I welcome that. Does he recall that, at the beginning, franchising was done not by his Department but by an independent, arm&#8217;s-length body? Twenty-four franchises were issued in some 18 months, none of which was subject to a legal challenge, and this led to the major investment in the railways to which he has referred. Franchising was subsequently brought in-house to the Department. Can he confirm that the Brown review will consider whether franchising should continue to be the job of his Department or whether we should revert to the initial model?</p>

	<p pid="c.50.1/1">May I express my sympathy for the new Secretary of State&#8217;s having to deal with this mess? However, in view of the fact that the Department could not come up with figures that would be valid 10 years hence, how can he believe that the same Department, the same officials and the same advisers can come up with accurate predictions on passenger levels, and on inflation generally, in relation to High Speed 2, which does not exist and for which there is no evidence to draw on? I think he needs to look at that matter again. I will not say that he needs to go back to the drawing board; in the case of HS2, it is more a matter of going back to the ouija board.</p>

	<p pid="c.50.2/1">I am interested to hear what the right hon. Gentleman says. A number of points have been raised since I made the announcement. The HS2 business case has undergone an extensive quality assurance process, and we are confident that it is accurate. The August 2012 update on the economic case was supported by a 400-person day of independent quality assurance, and HS2 Ltd has appointed independent auditors to undertake a line-by-line check of the analysis being prepared for the deposit of the hybrid Bill. This is all in addition to the existing quality assurance arrangements. I am glad to say that there was a commitment to these proposals in the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party manifesto to the country as well as in our own.</p>

	<p pid="c.50.3/1">My right hon. Friend has come into the Department for Transport like a breath of fresh air. However, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, he must know that the failure of the west coast main line franchise process has really shaken people&#8217;s faith in the facts and figures that are being used by the Department. Notwithstanding the answer that he gave to the right hon. Gentleman, while he is in the mood for ordering investigations, will he now order a full review of the facts and figures that were used to justify HS2, in order to prevent the Department from making a serious mistake?</p>

	<p pid="c.51.0/1">The Secretary of State emphasised in his statement that he would seek &#8220;best value for taxpayers&#8221; in the interim arrangements. He will understand that there is a degree of scepticism in the House about his ability to deliver that. Will he please tell us how he intends to achieve that best value and what comparators he will use? How can he believe that a short-term, nine-to-13-month deal followed by an interim arrangement before the tendering process begins can possibly deliver best value for the taxpayer?</p>

	<p pid="c.51.2/1">The short-term fix of asking Virgin to continue operating the west coast service will come as some relief and will provide some certainty in the short term, but how will the Secretary of State convince this House and, more importantly, passengers using the west coast main line, that the two-year interim franchise deal will not lead to a complete lack of investment, given that the new franchise holder will not have the confidence of a long-term deal?</p>

	<p pid="c.51.3/1">I would say that the position in which we find ourselves is not the position I would have wanted to be in. What I am trying to do is to move forward with some certainty so that when we learn the lessons from the Brown review, they can be implemented and acted on. There is considerable interest in this particular line&#8212;it is very important&#8212;and I think we will see the sort of developments we want, with companies putting forward proposals, with respect to both the two-year contract that we are proposing to let and the longer-term one in due course.</p>

I listened intently to what he said in his statement, but he made no mention of any contingency funding that will need to be put in place as a result of this debacle.

	<p pid="c.52.2/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his decision and on his statement. In it, he said that he has paused the ongoing franchise programme. Will he use that pause to ensure higher minimum standards and that the Great Western franchise is not given to FirstGroup as a sop?</p>

Obviously, there will be no sops to any organisations. These are very competitive bids and a lot of work and effort goes into them.

	<p pid="c.52.4/1">I genuinely welcome the Secretary of State to his position.

	<p pid="c.52.5/2">As I have said, the three franchises have not been stopped.

	<p pid="c.64.1/1">I want to make a statement about the referendum on independence for Scotland. The House will appreciate that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland is unable to deliver the statement because he attended the meeting between the Prime Minister and the First Minister in Edinburgh to secure agreement on an independence referendum for Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/2">In January this year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland delivered to the House a statement about the referendum. At that time, we acknowledged the Scottish National Party&#8217;s victory in the May 2012 Scottish parliamentary election and its manifesto pledge to hold an independence referendum. The Government also made clear their view that the Scottish Parliament did not have the legal power to legislate for an independence referendum. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made an offer that the UK Government would bring forward an order to give the Scottish Parliament that legal power.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/3">Since January, the UK and Scottish Governments have held consultations, there has been considerable public debate, and numerous discussions between Ministers have taken place. Many of those discussions took place between me and Bruce Crawford MSP, the Minister for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy in the Scottish Government, and I acknowledge his contribution to today&#8217;s agreement. Following 10 months of deliberation and four weeks of direct negotiations between the Scottish Government&#8217;s Deputy First Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I am pleased to report to the House that today in Edinburgh the Prime Minister and the First Minister have made an agreement that will allow a legal, fair and decisive referendum to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/4">This is a significant agreement. The two Governments have agreed that there should be a referendum. We have agreed that the referendum will consist of a single question. It will offer a choice between remaining within the United Kingdom and independence. We have agreed that it must be held before the end of 2014. The referendum will be based on the normal legal framework for UK referendums, with oversight from the Electoral Commission. That includes the key issues of how the referendum question will be determined, and how the rules governing spending and campaigning will be established.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/5">Following today&#8217;s agreement, the Government will bring forward an Order in Council under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. I have today placed a copy of the agreement and the draft order in the Library of the House. The agreement and draft order are also available to Members from the Vote Office. The order will be laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-22">22 October</phrase> and will be debated by both Houses of this Parliament and by the Scottish Parliament. All Members of this House will have the opportunity to consider and vote on the order. If both Parliaments approve the order, and after it is approved by Her Majesty in Council, the Scottish Parliament will have the legal competence to legislate for the referendum. We hope that the order will be passed by February 2013. Once that has happened, the Scottish Government will introduce a referendum Bill, setting out the wording</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/6">of the question, the date of the referendum and the rules for the campaign for the Scottish Parliament to consider.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/7">As part of today&#8217;s agreement, the two Governments have agreed that the rules for the referendum will be based on the rules set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Those rules were used successfully in the two referendums that took place last year. The two Governments have also confirmed that the Electoral Commission will review the proposed referendum question and that its report will be laid before the Scottish Parliament. That is the same process as applies to other UK referendums. Interested parties will be able to submit their views on the question to the Electoral Commission in the usual way. The Scottish Government will then respond to the Electoral Commission&#8217;s report.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/8">Both Governments agree on the need for maximum transparency in this process and for a level playing field. Therefore, as part of today&#8217;s agreement, the Scottish Government will consult the two campaign organisations that have been established for their views before proposing spending limits for the referendum campaign to the Scottish Parliament. The Electoral Commission will also provide the Scottish Government with advice on the appropriate spending limits for the two campaigns in the referendum, as has happened in previous referendums, such as the 2011 referendum in Wales on further powers for the Welsh Assembly. In that referendum, the Electoral Commission recommended that the spending limit for designated campaign organisations should be set by reference to the expenditure limits that apply to elections to the relevant legislature. In its response to both Governments&#8217; consultation documents, the Electoral Commission provided its view that that model remains appropriate for the Scottish independence referendum.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/9">Both Governments agree that all those who were entitled to vote in the Scottish Parliament elections in May 2011 should be able to vote in the referendum. As with all referendums held in any part of the UK, it will be the legislation that establishes the referendum that sets the franchise. It will therefore be for the Scottish Parliament to define the franchise in the referendum Bill, as would be the case for any other referendum&#8212;or indeed election&#8212;on matters within its devolved competence.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/10">Although both Governments agree that the basis of the franchise will be that for the Scottish Parliament elections, the Scottish Government have proposed to extend the franchise to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. It will be for them to make the case for that change and to deal with the technical issues that may arise. There is, of course, a range of opinions in this House about changes to the voting age. However, having agreed the principle that the Scottish Parliament should have the legal power to legislate for the referendum&#8212;that it should be a referendum &#8220;made in Scotland&#8221;&#8212;the Government accept that it should be for the Scottish Parliament to determine the franchise. I fully expect that the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals will be debated robustly in the Scottish Parliament. Any decision taken by the Scottish Parliament for the referendum will not affect the voting age for parliamentary and local government elections anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/11">Today&#8217;s agreement is important, as will be the consideration of the agreement and the order by this House. However, I would also like us to reflect on what will come after. Now that the Governments have agreed</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/12">the process for the referendum, it is vital that we get on with the debate about the most important political decision that people in Scotland will ever take. The UK Government have started to prepare the analysis and evidence for which people in Scotland are calling. Over the next year, the Government will publish thorough, evidence-based information that will set out the key issues in the independence debate. That analysis will be comprehensive, robust and open to external scrutiny. I fully expect it to show that Scotland is better off within the United Kingdom and that the rest of the United Kingdom is better with Scotland in it.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/13">The Government believe passionately in the United Kingdom. We will work tirelessly over the next two years to show the Scottish people and everyone else in this country that together we are stronger, that together we can overcome the challenges confronting us, and that together we can build a better future for Scotland as an integral part of the United Kingdom. The debates ahead will no doubt be long, challenging and, at times, heated. However, I fervently believe that, with the support of colleagues across the House, across Scotland and across the whole of the United Kingdom, in the autumn of 2014, fellow Scots will join me in choosing to stay as part of the United Kingdom. We are indeed better together. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.0/1">I thank the Minister for providing me in advance with a copy of the statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/2">This is, without doubt, an historic day for Scotland and the Scottish people. Now is the time for the debate on Scotland&#8217;s future to move out of the corridors of power and on to the streets of Scotland. I join the Minister in welcoming the fact that an agreement has been reached. It brings all Scots, me included, one step closer to deciding the future of our country.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/3">The Opposition welcome the fact that the deal has been reached, but will seek guarantees that both parties will adhere to the agreement in spirit and in practice. We also have a number of questions to raise. Our position has always been that the referendum must be fair, legal and decisive. We welcome the fact that there will be a legal referendum with a single question and a regulatory role for the Electoral Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/4">Labour has always been, and will continue to be, the party of devolution. Labour brought devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and we will continue to make the case for our devolution settlement to develop and evolve. We are, and have always been, a party of constitutional renewal, and we know that the best interests of our people are served by binding together, not breaking apart. In the debate about our future over the next two years, we will therefore promote devolution within the Union against those who seek to bring it to an end.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/5">The agreement sets out a framework for how we will move forward to the referendum, but I would welcome clarity on a number of a points, which I hope the Minister will address. First, the Electoral Commission should clearly play a significant role in the process, particularly with regard to the referendum question and the funding of campaigns. Can he assure the House that the memorandum of agreement ensures that the Scottish Government must comply with, not turn their back on,</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/6">the Electoral Commission&#8217;s advice? If they do turn their back on that advice, or seek to do so, what action will be taken? Given that no other Government have ever done that, it would be exceptionally damaging to the conduct and process of the referendum.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/7">Secondly, the terms of the agreement leave significant ambiguity regarding the funding of each campaign and the opportunity for financing or related activity by interested third parties. Does the agreement ensure that the limits set by the Electoral Commission will be binding? Will organisations such as trade unions and businesses be able to participate in the referendum in a way comparable to that in which they participated in the Welsh and alternative vote referendums? Does the Minister agree that it is troubling that even before the agreement was signed stating that the Electoral Commission would have a regulatory role, the First Minister&#8217;s aides were briefing the press that they would be willing to ignore the Electoral Commission?</p>
	<p pid="c.66.0/8">Finally, we must ensure that there is adequate scrutiny of the agreement and the subsequent process in this House. Will the Minister therefore explain what opportunity there will be to debate the detail of the section 30 order on the Floor of the House? Will he assure me that either he or the Secretary of State will provide regular updates to the House as the process continues over the next two years?</p>

	<p pid="c.67.0/1">I welcome the hon. Lady&#8217;s welcome for the agreement and her contribution to the debate that has led to it. It is important that the agreement sets out a clear role for the Electoral Commission in relation to both the question and the funding of the campaigns. It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which the Scottish Government would want to ignore the Electoral Commission&#8217;s recommendations. As she said, no Government have ever done so, and there would be not just a procedural problem but a significant political price to pay for any party that sought to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/2">We should never underestimate the Scottish people. It is wrong to suggest that they could somehow be duped into supporting independence by any form of chicanery or trickery that might come from either side of the debate. They are much too sensible for that, and I have every confidence that when the referendum comes, whatever the form of the question and however the campaign has been funded, they will make the right decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.1/1">As an Anglo-Scot, like my right hon. Friend the Minister and the Prime Minister, I believe passionately in the Union and believe that the campaign to remove Scotland must fail.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/2">The Electoral Commission&#8217;s involvement is much to be commended, and I commend my right hon. Friend for what he said about it. However, the proposal to extend the franchise to 16-year-olds, who cannot lawfully buy alcohol, drive a motor car or be called to fight on the front line, but who will now be invited to opine on one of the greatest constitutional issues of our time, is surely a nonsense that will create a dangerous precedent.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.2/1">I can assure my hon. Friend that it will not create a precedent. The franchise for parliamentary and local government elections throughout the United</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/2">Kingdom will be determined by opinions in this House. At the moment, the Government have no proposals to change the voting age, and I do not believe there is a majority in the House to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/3">I say to my hon. Friend and others who share his views that they must now take their arguments to Scotland and the Scottish Parliament, so that the Scottish Government can be held to account when they bring forward their proposals. This is a moment for the Scottish Parliament to demonstrate its own robust ability to scrutinise legislation. When it identifies complexities with enfranchising 16 and 17-year-olds, of which there are many, it can hold the Scottish Government to account and argue against the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.68.0/1">I thank the Minister for his statement, although he will forgive me if I do not welcome the final two or three paragraphs. However, I thank him for very early sight of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.0/2">This decision is historic, and I agree with the Minister that it is the most important that we will ever take. It also has the potential to be exciting and transformative for Scotland when the Scottish people vote yes. I very much welcome the 2014 timeline, which was of course the Scottish Government&#8217;s favoured position, and the extension of the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds&#8212;also a Scottish Government position.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.0/3">Does the Minister agree that the most exciting part of this is that, as he said, the Scottish Parliament will be the final determiner of the question? It has the only mandate of any Parliament in the UK to set a question on independence for Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="c.68.4/1">I had understood that the Liberals brought forward proposals for home rule for Scotland 100 years ago, but I am sure that we look forward to the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#8217;s contribution to the debate. He has made a distinguished contribution to the discussion of Scotland&#8217;s constitutional future</p>
	<p pid="c.68.4/2">over the years. I think the people of Scotland will indeed be pleased that we can move on from a debate and discussion that have been purely about process to ones on the real issues. The Prime Minister and those campaigning in the Better Together organisation have committed to setting out a positive vision for the United Kingdom, with Scotland playing a part in it. It is incumbent on those arguing for independence for Scotland finally to answer the questions and set out what independence would really mean.</p>

	<p pid="c.69.0/1">The last time the Electoral Commission considered whether 16 and 17-year-olds should vote, it found that 78% of the British public, including the Scots, were against the change. Whatever opinion Members and the public may hold on the issue, why does not the Minister acknowledge that the question of the franchise, for referendums as well as for elections, is plainly a matter reserved by law to the United Kingdom Parliament, not to any devolved Administration? Given the questions that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40272" name="Margaret Curran">the Member for Glasgow East (Margaret Curran)</phrase> asked about the need for further scrutiny in the House, how will the House be able to have a prior vote on whether there can be votes at 16 or 17 in any type of poll across the whole Union?</p>

	<p pid="c.69.1/1">I assure the right hon. Gentleman that previous legislation setting out referendums has set the franchise, and that the procedure will be no different in the Scottish Parliament setting out the terms of this referendum and the franchise. All Members of the House will have an opportunity to vote on the section 30 order that will pass powers for holding the referendum to the Scottish Parliament, and the opportunity for a robust debate. All those who are concerned about 16 and 17-year-olds being give the vote in Scotland should make that argument now, and demonstrate the complexities and difficulties of the proposals brought forward by the SNP.</p>

On the coming debate, and particularly the scope of the Electoral Commission, we have seen in the First Minister&#8217;s press conference and televised statements from his Ministers, that they are already rowing back from the role of the Electoral Commission.

I do not, however, agree that Mr Salmond or the Scottish Parliament can blithely ignore the recommendations of the Electoral Commission. The commission&#8217;s recommendations have never previously been ignored by a Government, and it would be a serious political matter were that to happen. I am sure that the hon.

If they use the current electoral register, they will essentially allow only those who are16 years and 10 months old to vote. If they wish all 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, they will have to create their own register, and that carries with it significant complexities.</p>

Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase>. By yoking together two issues, we are causing ourselves a huge difficulty. Some of us may feel that voting for a section 30 order means that we are endorsing the vote for 16 to 17-year-olds. Should we ever vote on a referendum about the EU, for example, it would be impossible to imagine that we could deny the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK. We must insist that 16 and 17-year-olds either have the vote wholeheartedly, or&#8212;as I believe&#8212;that they should not have the vote on this major constitutional issue.</p>

I have absolute faith that the people of Scotland will not be duped by chicanery or trickery by the Scottish Government or anybody else in making this most important decision on the future of Scotland. If any Member of Parliament believes that any party in the referendum is guilty of such a charge, it is their job to hold it to account in debate, whether in the UK Parliament or the Scottish Parliament.

Gentleman said the Scottish Government would announce their proposals this November, but in fact he said that they will do so in November next year. For a party that has campaigned for decades for independence, the fact that you have no proposals on the table on what an independent Scotland would look like reflects the lack of thought you have given to the issue. That is unbecoming of you and unworthy of the people of Scotland.</p>

Very significant additional powers are about to come to Scotland and the Scottish Parliament through the Scotland Act 2012, which will involve the most significant transfer of financial powers since the Acts of Union 300 years ago.

I remain confident that the people of Scotland will not simply be duped into breaking Britain up because of trickery or other such behaviour by any party in the debate. It is for anybody who suspects such behaviour or who is dissatisfied with a Scottish Parliament rejection of the Electoral Commission report, which I still consider unlikely, to make that case within the political arena.</p>

	<p pid="c.77.6/1">I welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached and that I will have the opportunity finally to vote against separation, but why do we have to wait so long? Why the delay, why the dither? Is it not because the coalition Ministers on the one hand and the SNP on the other have been meeting in secret and not taking account of the views of the vast majority of the Scottish people?</p>
	<p pid="c.77.6/2">Our consultation here at Westminster said that we wanted the referendum to be soon, and the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation said&#8212;well, we do not know what it said, because they have not published it. The deal has been reached before the consultation has been published. What scrutiny will there be of the detail of the arrangement? For example, will tax exiles have the right to vote? Are we going to have foreign money coming in? Will there be an opportunity to amend not the broad sweep but the detail of these proposals? And what sanctions will there be if somebody breaks an agreement that was reached in good faith?</p>

	<p pid="c.78.5/1">First, my experience of the Labour party in Dumfries and Galloway is that it is very good at getting people on to the electoral register&#8212;and I am sure it will be so again in getting 16 and 17-year-olds registered. The Scottish Government will have to come forward with legally watertight proposals; otherwise, they will be subject to challenge. As we have heard, they could conduct the referendum on the basis of so-called attainers, by which is meant people who will turn 18 within the cycle of the electoral register. It is clear that that could be done legally, but the downside, from the Scottish Government&#8217;s point of view, is that not all 16 and 17-year-olds would be able to vote as not all of them would be on the register, because of that age</p>

	<p pid="c.81.6/1">At near enough to 7 o&#8217;clock, I am glad that we finally turn our attention to the Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Bill. Anybody following these proceedings might be astonished that we have been allowed just over two hours for the Committee stage. In our view it is unsatisfactory to leave the rules governing &#163;50 billion of public expenditure to such scant and inadequate scrutiny. Although we do not necessarily disagree with the broad principles behind the Bill, that does not mean that we should fall short in our duty as parliamentarians to analyse, consider and improve the details of the legislation. Ministers cannot point to the House of Lords as the place where the Bill can be improved and amended if we run out of time for consideration in Committee. I think the last time the Lords sat in Committee on a money Bill was in 1995, when it considered the European Communities (Finance) Bill. This two-hour period is therefore the only opportunity we will get to scrutinise the particulars of the legislation; hence the amendments that are before us.</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/2">I want to talk to amendments 11 and 9 in this first group. Amendment 11 would make it clear that the substantive powers in the Bill, which give Ministers the ability to grant financial assistance to any persons, should be used for infrastructure in the United Kingdom, for essentially this reason: we believe that we should focus all our efforts on the domestic infrastructure needs of our country. That is why we think the Bill, if it can bring benefits, needs to focus very much on the benefits of infrastructure and bringing forward capital schemes here at home. Hon. Members will be aware that the UK has been falling behind quite considerably in the past couple of years in terms of infrastructure</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/3">and capital investment schemes. Only today in the</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/4" class="italic">Financial Times</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/5">we read about the Construction Products Association warning that</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/6">&#8220;infrastructure is in free-fall,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/7">and that it expects spending to fall by 13% in 2012 compared with the last calendar year, despite the hollow words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Noble Francis, economics director at the CPA, said:</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/8">&#8220;We are getting to the stage where the government just can&#8217;t make more announcements with nothing happening. At some stage they are going to have to launch some capital investment that sees work happening on the ground. This can be done quickly, easily and cheaply speeding up work on the repair and maintenance of roads, schools, hospitals and housing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/9">The article points out that road construction, to take one example of infrastructure investment,</p>
	<p pid="c.81.6/10">&#8220;is suffering in particular, with the CPA projecting a decline of 40 per cent this year and 5 per cent next year.&#8221;</p>

Rather than driving new schemes forward, with their Bill and the rest of their strategy, the Government seem to be waiting for others to come forward with various schemes; they seem to be saying, &#8220;Please will you dream up some ideas?&#8221; They are hoping that something will turn up, but that is an approach characterised by drift rather than leadership when it comes to capital investment.</p>

	<p pid="c.82.2/1">Is the situation not worse than that? In the early days of this Government, one of the first things they did was stop the Building Schools for the Future programme, which had been clarified and was seen as the way forward to develop new schools. There were projects involving five schools in my constituency, which would have put &#163;80 million into the local economy, with the money spent on the private sector and building schools for those children. Those projects were frozen&#8212;the same thing happened across the country&#8212;but if they had gone ahead, we would now be in a much better position.</p>

	<p pid="c.82.3/1">It is the long-term cost to public service quality and communities up and down the country that is the most frustrating thing about the Government&#8217;s approach. They have scrapped Building Schools for the Future. Who knows? Perhaps in a couple of years&#8217; time they will realise the error of their ways and devise a &#8220;Funding building for schools&#8221; scheme, or cobble together some other name. It is no wonder that we are in this prolonged double-dip recession, with the Government</p>
	<p pid="c.82.3/2">pulling the rug from underneath the economy in the way that they have, chopping capital infrastructure investment away at its knees. It is no wonder that, for example, the construction sector has shrunk by, I think, 10% in the past 12 months. Nor is it any wonder that the &#8220;State of Trade&#8221; survey published by the Federation of Master Builders today&#8212;apparently it is the only survey of its kind looking at SME construction activity&#8212;says that 39% of respondents reported a decline in private new house building workloads in the third quarter of this year or that 40% predicted a further decline in the next quarter.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.3/3">The Government&#8217;s record on capital investment and their approach to infrastructure are lamentable. It has never been clearer that they should be focusing squarely on the needs of infrastructure within the United Kingdom; hence amendment 11. Contrary to the claims of the Government&#8212;we will probably hear this from the Minister&#8212;figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the Government will have spent &#163;6.6 billion less over the three-year period from the spending review than Labour had planned, with budgets for schools, such as BSF, and affordable housing hit especially hard.</p>

This is not simply a question of the levels of capital investment; it is also a question of competence. It is also about the relentless need to focus on delivery, and on the detail behind the delivery. I just do not see the Treasury, as currently comprised, being capable of getting to grips with the granularity of some of the obstacles that face capital schemes. It is no wonder that we are falling further and further behind. The Treasury seems to see an obstacle and be deterred by it, rather than trying to tackle it and move past it.</p>

In my constituency, the total number of new house builds in the last quarter was just 10, and that is in a city whose population is growing. Does he accept that, in addition to the immediate difficulties that the construction industry is experiencing, companies that go bust and firms that close down cannot suddenly spring back into action when the economy changes? This is another reason why we need the measures that he is outlining, and that the Government have not yet put into operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.84.1/1">That loss of productive capacity is another example of the permanent damage caused by recession, resulting in an inability to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves when a recovery occurs. The International Monetary Fund released figures only last week to illustrate the damage being done by the recession to our ability to fulfil such expectations. In my city of Nottingham, not a single new affordable social house has been constructed in the past 12 months. Is that because there is no demand? Absolutely not. We have more than 12,000 people on waiting lists for decent homes. That applies in many other areas of the country as well, including Greenwich.</p>

	<p pid="c.84.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid point about housing, but he understates the case. Infrastructure was the one sector of the construction industry that survived the early period of the recession relatively well. Indeed, by 2009, expenditure on infrastructure stood at &#163;11.6 billion, which was the highest real-terms level for about two decades. That has now slipped away badly, because of the failure of the current Government to maintain infrastructure investment. That is the charge against them: they have allowed activity that was helping to counter the recession to be lost, and the sectors of the industry that are concerned with infrastructure are now as alarmed as the housing sector and all the others that have suffered so badly in the recession.</p>

	<p pid="c.84.3/1">That is a pertinent point. The Government seem oblivious to the thoughtful concerns being expressed by industry practitioners about the damage that is being done. Their ideological fixation with austerity has led them to a position in which they have completely pulled the rug out from underneath the economy, and we are still only at an early stage of being able to calculate the damage.</p>

	<p pid="c.85.0/1">It is important to recognise that we want the benefits of any financial assistance to be felt in the UK economy. I shall deal with the details of the amendments in a moment. We believe that the scheme should focus on stimulating growth within these shores, and prioritising resources for infrastructure within the United Kingdom is the right approach. The Minister will undoubtedly point out that, as part of the guarantees under the scheme that the Government announced in July, a &#163;5 billion export refinancing facility was introduced to underwrite the lending commitments of foreign buyers of UK exports. Of course we believe that export credit guarantees can be legitimate and helpful to construction exports, but in times of UK recession, our priorities should lie squarely here at home.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/2">Incidentally, if there is such a great demand for the services of the Export Credits Guarantee Department&#8212;which is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills&#8212;why does it appear to have underspent its existing budget in the past year? That does not suggest that there is a need to divert resources from domestic infrastructure into bankrolling foreign firms any more than is currently the case. The latest research shows that infrastructure spending within the UK will be of far greater benefit to our economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/3">Indeed, the IMF had discussions last week about the multipliers. I do not want to go into too much technical detail, but the Office for Budget Responsibility used a fiscal multiplier of 0.5, which meant that Ministers thought that each pound they cut from public expenditure and capital investment would reduce economic output by only 50p. However, after examining the records of many countries that have embraced austerity since the financial crisis, the IMF reckons that the true multiplier is between 0.9 and 1.7. That has led the TUC to reveal that if the real multiplier is 1.3&#8212;somewhere in the middle of the IMF&#8217;s range&#8212;the OBR has underestimated the impact of the cuts by a cumulative &#163;76 billion, more than 8% of gross domestic product, over five years. Instead of shaving less than 1% off economic growth during this financial year, austerity has potentially depressed it by more than 2%, which helps to explain why the economy has plunged into this double-dip recession. It is self-evident that providing financial assistance to infrastructure projects in the UK will provide a much greater stimulus to the British economy than giving financial assistance to projects abroad. Projects in the UK will boost employment in Britain; providing assistance to overseas projects will not.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/4">Conservative Governments have a dubious record when it comes to underwriting foreign construction schemes. I am referring not only to the most recent, and much vaunted, export enterprise finance guarantee scheme, which assisted only five firms and has now folded because it was such a flop. I am also thinking of historic occasions such as that relating to the Pergau dam in Malaysia, which involved a too-close relationship between the aid being given to a foreign country and the trade</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/5">that was taking place, particularly in relation to arms exports. It is very important that we learn the lessons from past failures when it comes to finance for foreign infrastructure schemes, and we particularly need to start prioritising schemes here in the UK.</p>

In Northern Ireland, for instance, many of the infrastructure projects are likely to have a cross-border character. Infrastructure projects both large and small sometimes have commitments of money from the Irish Government as they serve hinterlands that cross the borders. With renewable energy, of course it makes sense for significant projects to have a cross-border character. They will serve not only Northern Ireland&#8217;s but Great Britain&#8217;s future energy needs. Might not my hon. Friend&#8217;s amendment preclude sensible investment support for such projects?</p>

I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I do not think this is the be-all-and-end-all of Treasury expenditure, as there are other ways and means of dealing with those few projects that might have a cross-border character.

	<p pid="c.87.4/1">Looking through the detail of that national infrastructure plan helps us to realise how far the Government are falling short. Let us start looking at some of the particular schemes that are of great concern to our constituents here in the United Kingdom. The A14 road link between Felixstowe and the midlands, for example, was promised immediate investment in the national infrastructure plan in 2011, but the Department for Transport has now said that the construction will not begin for six years, subject to agreement with various local authorities on funding packages and so forth. There is already much concern about that particular scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.4/2">The Mersey Gateway bridge is another example. Many Cabinet Ministers described it as incredibly important. I think the Chancellor and the Transport Secretary at the time said that it could be implemented quickly, but although the Department for Transport wanted construction to begin in 2010, there will not be a preferred bidder until late 2013. Construction will not start until the end of that year and it is not due to open until 2016, or potentially even later.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.1/1">My hon. Friend is totally correct. Ministers seem to think they can come to the Dispatch Box and make a set of announcements, which will then magically happen as they busy themselves in their part-time political advisory roles or whatever they happen to be doing. If we start to walk through the projects one by one, we realise that Ministers are not gripping the issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.3/1">A pattern is emerging, but I shall not use the word &#8220;omnishambles&#8221;, which is probably past its best. There is great concern about these schemes. Thameslink, for example, is a project that is slipping considerably. The contracts for rolling stock were due to be awarded by early 2012; then it was by the summer, and now the Department says that the contract with the preferred bidder will be signed in the autumn. The Transport Select Committee is on top of that issue. It is writing to Secretaries of State asking why there is a delay with the rolling stock procurement, and I am sure that the Minister will be able to reply to that question when he responds to the debate. However, many other significant questions about delay need to be answered.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/2">We need to know about the ongoing programme of work on the north Doncaster chord, a rail link that is greatly needed in that part of Yorkshire. The national infrastructure plan of 2011 promised that a business case would be provided by April 2012, but the proposed development is still awaiting a decision from the Secretary of State, which must be delivered before production can continue and construction can start.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/3">The preferred bidder for the extension of the Northern line to Battersea was announced in June. A Treasury source then told the <i>Evening Standard</i>:</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/4">&#8220;The entire weight of the Government is being thrown behind the extension of the Northern Line&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/5">but nearly a year after the Chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement, the extension is still subject to the existence of funds. Despite backing from the</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/6">&#8220;entire weight of the Government&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/7">Transport for London can only say:</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/8">&#8220;Subject to funding being in place and permission from the Secretary of State for Transport, the new stations could be open by 2019.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/9">The construction of the Green Port Hull was due to begin this year, but Siemens now says that it will not sign a contract for the wind turbine factory until 2013. As for carbon capture and storage, the Department for Energy and Climate Change was supposedly</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/10">&#8220;developing a streamlined selection process&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/11">and &#163;1 billion of capital was supposedly available to support the project, but construction is not due to begin until 2014.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/12">Planning permission was granted in March for biomass electricity generation at Royal Portbury dock, but E.ON is currently taking time to</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/13">&#8220;review the prospects for the project in light of the UK Government&#8217;s current banding review&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/14">Again, a Government decision is awaited.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/15">I am sure that I do not need to mention the issue of the 4G mobile spectrum auction and roll-out. Many Members may be checking their not necessarily 4G-compatible handsets as I speak. However, I will say that a very messy approach was taken to the auction of that particular regulatory arrangement, and that anyone who may be thinking of buying an iPhone 5 should be careful, because it will not necessarily be compatible with many possible providers. This is an example of our falling many years behind the United States, Germany, Sweden and parts of Asia. Unlike this country, they already have 4G services which are giving businesses opportunities to benefit customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/16">We need only compare the much-vaunted promises of the 2011 national infrastructure plan with the actuality of the infrastructure pipeline that was announced in April. Although 182 new projects had been added, 63 had disappeared without explanation. Of the 357 projects announced in November that were updated in April, nearly two thirds were still in pre-procurement stages, and just 38 had proceeded to procurement or construction. Of the 229 that were still at the pre-procurement stage, three quarters were still at the same stage as had been reported in November 2011, and 36 had moved backwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.3/17">Members may recall the regional growth fund, the supposed successor of the regional development agencies and, supposedly, the Government&#8217;s flagship alternative for regional economic development. Although the winners were announced in, I believe, April 2011, fewer than half the final offer agreements in rounds 1 and 2 of the fund have been put in place. Only &#163;60 million of the &#163;1.4 billion fund to spur growth has been released to businesses, and, according to a report by the Public Accounts Committee, the &#163;364 million spent by the fund so far has been held up in intermediaries such as banks and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.89.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, and I hope that we shall hear a response to it shortly. Has he seen the assessment by the British Chambers of Commerce which&#8212;before the election, I believe&#8212;identified 13 critical infrastructure projects,</p>

	<p pid="c.90.1/1">May I intervene on my hon. Friend before he leaves the subject of the regional spread of investment? He will recall that on Second Reading I informed the House of changes in the level of infrastructure investment region by region. Some regions experienced an increase in investment between 2009 and 2011&#8212;most notably London, whose 18% increase was probably fuelled by the Olympics&#8212;but all the rest of the country, apart from three regions, experienced a reduction. Investment fell by 31% in Yorkshire and the Humber and the north-west, and by 32% in Wales. Does my hon. Friend think that the Bill, and the fund that it will establish, will provide an opportunity for some of those regional imbalances to be redressed?</p>

	<p pid="c.90.2/1">I would like to hope so, but I do not advise my hon. Friend to hold his breath. We are not even talking about a fund; we are talking about promises to under-run funds in order to guarantee other schemes as they come forward. Where is the confidence? Where is the demand in the economy? Where are the private sector schemes whose organisers want to come forward? Far greater efforts must be made, and the Government must take the economic climate more seriously. We should be bringing forward schemes, prioritising UK infrastructure, and kick-starting construction here at home. We have suggested that revenue from the 4G spectrum auction should be used to fund the building of 100,000 new homes, and we are more than happy for the Chancellor to steal our thunder in the autumn&#8212;or should I say Christmas&#8212;statement on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-05">5 December</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.90.3/1">I think we should be a bit careful. I thought that the Bill to which we are being invited to consent would provide solely, or primarily, for guarantees and loans, but in fact it allows expenditure and</p>

	<p pid="c.90.4/1">I think that the right hon. Gentleman is technically correct. The wording of the Bill is very loosely framed. We know that accounting officers in the Treasury had put a big question mark over exactly what Ministers were proposing. They wanted one line to</p>
	<p pid="c.90.4/2">cover them in circumstances in which things might go wrong, and they would be challenged and hauled before the Public Accounts Committee. That dates back to the 1932 concordat on public accounts, and it is being radically changed by the Bill. We do not necessarily think that that is the wrong thing to do, but it is noticeable that legislation has been presented to the House of Commons by Ministers who cannot say what it will be used for. We need information on the specifics of the schemes and the dates on which they will be supported. That is the level of detail that we require.</p>
	<p pid="c.90.4/3">Amendment 9 relates to the definition of &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; in clause 1. I am sorry that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> was not selected; he noticed that flood defence schemes were not included in the list of items covered by infrastructure expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.90.4/4">Our amendment seeks to insert the word &#8220;childcare&#8221;. Education is included in the set of infrastructure projects that might benefit from the scheme, but child care is quite different. We consider that to be an obvious anomaly which the Government should correct. We know that the costs of child care are afflicting many families throughout the country, a number of whom are not necessarily choosing to enter employment because the child care options are too limited or too expensive. One of the reasons why child care is so expensive is that the facilities are expensive. We do not have enough of them, and we need more investment in them.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that many of the infrastructure projects the Government have talked about have been in typically masculine industries? Does he also agree that one of the huge advantages of investment in child care is that it also helps to redress the high level of female unemployment&#8212;it is the highest in a quarter of a century&#8212;because it offers the opportunity for more mothers to go out to work and because that sector remains largely dominated by female employees?</p>

	<p pid="c.91.3/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s point is borne out by the statistics. Only 67% of mothers in the UK are in employment, which compares with figures of 84% in Denmark, 79% in the Netherlands and 74% in France. That reflects on the characteristics of our national output and our economy. More could be done to help those parents to gain access to employment. Families in the UK with pre-school-age children spend more on child care than is spent by this group in any other OECD country, except Switzerland. More nursery places and more not-for-profit providers of child care would help to drive down that cost. According to the OECD, the cost of child care in the UK is more than 26% of the average family income in those circumstances, whereas the OECD average is just under 12%, so this is a very significant drag on family budgets and it is holding back our economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.3/2">The Daycare Trust has called for Government assistance to enable children&#8217;s centres, smaller private providers and not-for-profit early years providers to expand. It has pointed out that some 28,000 extra nursery places for two-year-olds need to be found in London alone, so we can clearly see that child care issues need to be considered in the definition of &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; that could obtain support under this legislation. Those are the amendments that I wish to discuss for the time being, but other hon. Members will doubtless have noticed omissions in the legislation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.92.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" speakername="John Redwood" colnum="92"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101531000915">
	<p pid="c.92.0/1">My concern about this Bill is with the definitions and the amount of money involved. I am obviously very much in favour of more productive infrastructure projects going ahead as quickly as possible. There may well be utility in facilitating the Government to make guarantees, support or indemnities available at a time when the banking system is still not functioning well and it is difficult getting these things financed privately in the way we normally like. However, I start from the proposition that what we really need to be doing is generating a lot more freestanding private sector investment projects. It would be better if we took stronger and faster action to remedy the banking problems that lie underneath the problems we face in getting these things financed.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/2">I am concerned that the wide-ranging powers in clause 1 may lead to a big increase in public spending, which would damage the Government&#8217;s fiscal targets. A lot of time and energy has been expended by Governments on reducing capital programmes to try to get public spending down to levels thought to be more compatible with reality and markets. We want to avoid this Bill becoming a way of undoing all the hard work that has been done to try to get the deficit down, at a time when this Government strongly believe that deficit reduction is crucial. The outgoing Government actually enacted legislation committing themselves to halving the deficit over the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/3">The definition of &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; in clause 1(2) is wide ranging. I thought that the type of infrastructure we had in mind for this Bill was that in subsection 2(a), which states that infrastructure is about &#8220;water, electricity, gas, telecommunications&#8221;. Those services are all provided by the private sector with charges to customers, so there is a flow of revenue that can remunerate the capital. If those projects are held up because of banking difficulties, I have every wish to encourage the Minister, newly in his job&#8212;I give him my congratulations&#8212;to expedite them. One hopes that the Government would be properly rewarded for the indemnities and the guarantees, or that they would not be necessary in the fullness of time, and so the taxpayer would not lose by this process. I am happy with that provision, which I thought was the thrust of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/4">However, subsection (2) also provides for mixed projects and entirely public sector projects. It includes mixed projects in the form of railway facilities. Railways are extremely heavily subsidised, and any new project is likely to require many years of future subsidy, because such projects do not normally reward the railway operator or the taxpayer sufficiently from the fare revenue. We therefore need to consider, for any one of these projects, the medium-term and long-term implications of cash outflows from the public sector, as well as the private</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/5">sector revenues. Those things cause difficulty in the evaluation, as we have found recently through one of the franchise problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/6">Subsection (2) also makes provision in respect of areas where spending must entirely be an expense for the public sector&#8212;I assume that we are not envisaging court or prison facilities having paying guests who would contribute towards the costs, so this money will be entirely expended by the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.93.0/1">I return to an argument about prisons that I made on Second Reading. New prisons cost substantially less to run per place than old prisons and can better develop wider policy objectives&#8212;for example, on rehabilitation and work in prisons. When debating the Bill, reference should be made to the spending on prisons that would come from the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s delegated expenditure limit. This approach would enable the capital expenditure to happen now, in order to take the savings later.</p>

	<p pid="c.93.1/1">That is a helpful contribution, but it shows the dangers of this clause, because it demonstrates that if these projects are not properly evaluated they could be more expensive overall. My hon. Friend has recent experience as Minister with responsibility for prisons and he is saying that in the short term they will definitely be dearer, because the state will have a big cash outflow in order to buy the new prison. It will take time to close down the old one and find some alternative use for it, and that process might not produce anything like the amount of money that the new prison costs. He is arguing, with his former brief in mind, that this may still represent a good bargain for the taxpayer, but when we come to account for it, we will have to account for the fact that a lot more has been spent in the first couple of years; there may be benefits for Governments to come if, as he hopes, the thing is cheaper and better in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="c.93.1/2">In debating this clause, we need to unpack the three types of project we are talking about. The first is a genuine private sector project, where we hope that there will be no ultimate call on the taxpayer and it may just involve a facilitation guarantee that will be properly rewarded. The second is a mixed project, where a lot of accounting has to be done&#8212;as the Department for Transport is discovering, such projects are difficult to evaluate. The third is the pure public sector project, where we need to go into the departmental budget. So I hope that the Minister will give me some reassurances about this.</p>

	<p pid="c.93.2/1">I follow the argument that the right hon. Gentleman is making, although I do not necessarily share his conclusion. Health facilities are defined as one of the fields of infrastructure that this fund could be used to support. The recent health Bill showed that the Government favour more NHS services being provided by private contractors and private hospitals. Is he telling the Committee that he would be happy for this fund to be used to finance a private clinic or a private hospital, but not happy for it to be used to fund an NHS hospital trust?</p>

	<p pid="c.93.3/2">going to presume to give my views on total public spending, because that is a matter for another day and another debate. I am trying to get the Committee to understand that we are dealing with three different types of project, and the health one is closer to the pure public sector project. Even if it is carried out in a private sector facility with some so-called &#8220;private sector risk&#8221;, all the patients will be paid for by the NHS if it is for the NHS and so it is a flow of public revenue. We have to account for it in the proper way and be realistic about that.</p>

	<p pid="c.94.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making an interesting argument. Does he not also accept that one of the difficulties with long-term infrastructure projects is that they have different phases, some of which may be susceptible to public intervention and some of which, later on, will require private investment. Let me give the example of a large site in my constituency that is currently in private ownership and has large redevelopment potential. The initial investment will have to be public investment to decontaminate the land and prepare the planning requirements, but down the line one would hope to see private investment.

	<p pid="c.94.1/1">Yes, indeed. My point, which is not hostile to the Minister and is merely an attempt to inform the debate, is that we are discussing a set of very different projects and we are not sure what we are talking about because the Bill is very generic and general. We can probably all come to the conclusion that for this to work we will need precise control over what is being proposed&#8212;of how much of it is public, how much is private, how much involves a direct charge on the taxpayer and how much involves a guarantee or indemnity.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/2">If a guarantee or indemnity is involved, I am sure that the Minister, with his forensic financial backgrounds and skills, will be able to keep control of it and to reassure the Committee that it is unlikely to be called on unless it was absolutely essential and a very important project would not go ahead without it, which would mean that it was a reasonable risk to run. I am happy at that end of the spectrum, as we will have to trust the Minister&#8217;s judgment and this is a good Minister with the skills and ability to do such things. We need to probe when such projects are proposed, however, as we are the custodians of public money and do not want to end up with white elephant projects with huge guarantees and indemnities that will in due course have to be met by some Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/3">I am also concerned about the projects in which there is more of a mixture or a muddle, because they must be fitted in to the public expenditure plans. That does not prejudge whether the expenditure should be higher or lower, and there will be different views on that in the Committee, but they will need to be fitted into the plans. A large sum is involved&#8212;&#163;50 billion&#8212;and we do not know the time scale. The Government might want to come back and ask for more money, and a provision allows them to do so by order, so I want a little more information from the Minister about how such projects will fit into the public expenditure plans and how Ministers collectively will evaluate the mixed projects that receive a big flow of public subsidy and, more particularly, those that really are public sector projects. They might</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/4">be dressed up as private sector projects, but as far as I am concerned if all the money for the provision on behalf of customers or users of the service comes from the state, that is a public sector project and the private sector is merely a franchisee or agent of the state. If all the money comes from the state, I expect the state to have a grip of the project and to satisfy us that it represents value for money that is being organised in the best way.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.1/5">I am not ideologically driven as regards the provision of state services. I think that should be done in the cheapest possible way, provided that they offer good quality, and that always causes problems, but I hope that the Minister will give us some guidance about how he will differentiate and seek reassurances about the granting of those indemnities and guarantees and about what proportion of the projects will involve pure public spending, as the Bill entitles him to spend as well as offer guarantees.</p>

	<p pid="c.95.0/1">Although I accept much of the thrust of what my right hon. Friend has to say, does he not accept that if too much time and Treasury orthodoxy are spent on evaluating schemes at this stage, many of the infrastructure projects will simply not be built? We need to move ahead with getting them under way at the earliest opportunity if there is to be economic growth and some of the evaluation process to which he refers might be better placed at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="c.95.1/1">I normally agree with my hon. Friend, but I am afraid that I do not on this occasion. There is not now an excuse to go in for projects that do not make any economic sense just because we all want some more growth and jobs. Indeed, that would be a very good way of setting us all back further as it would damage the public finances without giving us the benefit of a good project that people wanted to use and that produced plenty of user revenue. When one is in a financial hole, as our country is, one needs to be very careful. We look to the Treasury, in particular, to evaluate such matters carefully and I want a little more guidance because &#163;50 billion is a huge sum. I am not surprised that so few MPs want to discuss it&#8212;if we were debating &#163;500 million, the place would probably be packed, but because we are discussing &#163;50 billion everyone has gone off for a tea or a coffee&#8212;but to me it is a serious sum of money and I want some reassurance that we will get something worth having for it.</p>

	<p pid="c.95.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> roamed over many of the issues covered on Second Reading and over the scepticism on both sides of the Committee. I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> that I think evaluation is critical, as we have seen with the west coast main line, and undertaking projects on a wing and prayer at this stage is dangerous, to say the least.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/2">The Bill, as we said on Second Reading, seems to be the reverse of the private finance initiative. PFI was meant to shift the risk on to the private sector, yet the Bill seems to shifting it back on to the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/3">I share the concerns. Clause 1(4) defines financial assistance in the broadest terms possible, so it could involve revenue assistance, and clause 1(3) refers to the operation of a project. In addition to a capital project, we could be subsidising in revenue terms the operation undertaken by a capital project. That leaves open the issue of hospitals being built by the private sector and then revenue supported under the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/4">There are anxieties, but I do not want to repeat everything that was said on Second Reading. One suggestion I made then was that to assist the Government in clarifying their policy on Heathrow we should table an amendment seeking to enact the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment not to proceed with a third runway or expansion at Heathrow before the next general election, leaving it open for a proper debate to be held at that time. My amendment simply does that. I am seeking to assist the Government in clarifying their policy and legislating accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.2/5">I hope that the Minister will repeat the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment tonight and, I hope, accept the amendment. That is even more important if we bear in mind recent statements. Only two weeks ago, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, confirmed that he accepted that there will not be a third runway at Heathrow and that he would operate British Airways on the basis of that decision. In addition, this weekend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published its research on air pollution and the impact of a third runway at Heathrow, which suggested that the number of deaths from air pollution would quadruple if a third runway went ahead. This is an ideal time for the Government to put on the statute book the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment that there will be no third runway at Heathrow in the lifetime of this Parliament. That is what the amendment does and I hope that it will receive a positive response from the Government.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> about the reassurance we should receive about the possibilities opened up by the Bill. The mechanism I have chosen to secure that reassurance is to table an amendment that would delete the reference to housing. I have no intention of pressing it to a Division; I am merely seeking clarity on what we want to achieve with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.0/2">On Second Reading, the Opposition spokesman said he thought that housing was infrastructure, but I am afraid that I do not&#8212;neither does the &#8220;Oxford Dictionary of Economics&#8221;, nor do <i>The Economist</i>or the Government in their 2011 national infrastructure plan. That does not mean, however, that I do not think that investment in housing is essential or necessary, which was the conclusion slightly unfairly drawn by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington on Second Reading. Given his interest in criminal justice, I was somewhat surprised that he then juxtaposed the need for decent prison facilities&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.96.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his customary self-criticism and generosity.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/2">The Minister must give us the necessary clarity. I note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> has tabled an amendment on housing schemes that would add the words &#8220;of national significance&#8221;&#8212;or words to that effect. It is at that point that alarm bells start ringing for me, as the Member for Reigate, a constituency wholly within the metropolitan green belt. We have had a significant increase in housing, particularly through infill but also through new housing schemes that were agreed and supported by the local authority, and there has been development in parts of Redhill, but that has actually led to a shortage of infrastructure to support the people in that housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/3">We desperately need two new primary schools locally, and then there is the small matter of the M23 never being finished. In these circumstances, when we are looking for capital schemes, it might be rather nice if the M23, several decades later, was finally finished properly where it joins the A23. In addition to the schemes that the Government will come forward with, which I anticipate will be announced in the expenditure statement, I hope that we can begin to look at some of the schemes that have been around for a long time and that these funding mechanisms will help to enable expenditure on them to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/4">I am seeking the same level of reassurance that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham seeks. I have the same implicit trust that he has in the ability of the Economic Secretary and the team of Treasury Ministers to manage these things satisfactorily, but Parliament is owed proper accountability on this.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/5">I am concerned that we will find housing schemes, particularly those of national significance, being imposed in the way they were under previous regional development strategies, with housing numbers simply being cascaded down from Whitehall to the regions, to the counties and then to local authorities, such as mine, in a way that leaves the borough councillors, as owners of the planning policy, completely unable to do anything other than mitigate the consequences. They have never been in the position that we, as a localist Government, want them to be in, in which they can judge between the economic and social need for housing locally and the environmental consequences of such development. Those are the balances that local authorities are there to draw.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/6">The Bill will suddenly enable a substantially greater amount of new expenditure to take place, but where is the link with the rhetoric about planning policy? I just want to raise that concern, as I did on Second Reading. I do not want the financial provisions set out in the Bill to be combined with planning policy debates that take place elsewhere, and then suddenly find that in constituencies such as mine the powers of local representatives are being overridden in some rush to develop housing, which by no stretch of the imagination is infrastructure in the proper sense of the word.</p>

	<p pid="c.97.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the experience of the past 15 years is that there has been very little cascading down, despite all the intentions to build new housing? Is he perhaps becoming over-concerned that the inclusion of housing as one of the infrastructure heads might mean that only a number of housing schemes&#8212;relatively small ones; not necessarily national housing schemes&#8212;become the shovel-ready schemes</p>
	<p pid="c.97.0/2">that the Treasury is looking to encourage given that some of the other heads might mean that considerably more time is required before anything is built?</p>

	<p pid="c.98.0/1">That is fine, but the borough councillors of Reigate of Banstead, as the planning authority, have a mandate from their local electors and they are perfectly capable of making decisions about the requirements for housing in the area and to weigh up the competing factors. That is the mandate they enjoy from local people and, as far as I am concerned, there is no need for the view that the gentleman in Whitehall knows best. If there is going to be a wider economic case for building, it needs to be made with great clarity. If that needs to be done with infrastructure of major national significance, there are bound to be occasions when local interests will have to be overridden in the wider national interest. As far as housing is concerned, the arguments are certainly significantly weaker in that regard than they are for actual national infrastructure, the benefits of which we will enjoy for decades to come. If we have too much jerry-built housing, we will then have to live with the environmental consequences for generations.</p>

	<p pid="c.98.1/2">I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase>, but I do not intend to engage in a debate with him. I will simply say that I think he is in for a big disappointment and that he clearly did not listen to the statement that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government made about changes to the planning system that will allow him to refer a whole series of matters to the Planning Inspectorate when he does not agree with a local council&#8217;s decision. I am afraid that that is where the Government have got to in relation to localism. However, I do not intend to enter into that debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.98.1/3">I entirely understand why the hon. Member for Reigate misinterpreted the effect of amendment 2, because the amendment paper gives the impression that it was designed to refer only to housing of &#8220;national significance&#8221;. It was not. It is simply that housing is the last item prior to the next clause. My reference to &#8220;national significance&#8221; applies to all the items, including roads, sewers and all the rest, as well as housing. The purpose of the amendment, which is what I will focus on, is to limit the impact of the definition of the Bill to schemes of national significance.</p>

	<p pid="c.98.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that clarification following my inability to read his amendment properly.

	<p pid="c.98.3/1">I said that I did not intend to engage in a debate on that subject. I believe that we need a great deal more housing in this country, but I will not engage with the hon. Gentleman in a debate about his constituency, which he knows much better than I do, and I certainly would not advocate extensive building on the green belt, which would be entirely inappropriate. I was simply drawing attention to the fact that the Secretary of State&#8217;s recent decision on planning, which came a mere</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/2">three or four months after the national planning policy framework was put in place, withdrew many of the original localist hopes about allowing decisions to rest with the local authority and made it clear that he would refer items over the local authority&#8217;s head to the Planning Inspectorate. To me, that is not localism, but let us leave it there.</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/3">I tabled the amendments simply to try to get clarity and focus on the uses and application of the Bill. As drafted, it is incredibly broad. I do not object to the definition set out in clause 1(2), but the definition in clause 1(3) states:</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/4">&#8216;&#8220;Provision&#8221; includes acquisition, design, construction, conversion, improvement, operation and repair.&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/5">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> pointed out, subsection (4) defines financial assistance as covering a whole range of activities, including</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/6">&#8220;loans, guarantees or indemnities, or any other kind of financial assistance&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.98.3/7">In theory at least, that definition would allow the Government to offer a guarantee literally on the repair of a door in a school or prison. Although that work might be entirely necessary and desirable, it is clearly nonsense for the provisions in this Bill, which are designed to allow major infrastructure schemes that are stalled for financial reasons to proceed. That is the purpose of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.0/1">I am following my right hon. Friend&#8217;s argument. I am slightly concerned about how he would define &#8220;national significance&#8221;. I can think of a number of important infrastructure projects in my region that could be described as being of national or regional significance. For instance, would dualling the A-road that goes around York be seen as nationally significant or not? Flood defences, a matter that I hope to raise later if I catch the Chairman&#8217;s eye, need to be designed on a region-wide basis. Would my right hon.

	<p pid="c.99.1/1">I think it very likely that any definition of &#8220;national significance&#8221; would include flood defence schemes, which are defined as infrastructure in the national infrastructure plan. My hon. Friend should not be troubled about their absence from the list, although he wishes to move an amendment to clarify the matter. There is no question but that flood defences are infrastructure, and if they protect from flooding areas of the country at risk of flooding, which is clearly catastrophic, the likely interpretation would be that they were of national significance.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/2">However, I do not propose to add a precise definition; I simply want to give an overall, overarching legislative obligation for the Bill to be used for the provision of financial assistance to schemes of genuinely national significance.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.2/1">I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Government could not merely offer a loan for the new school door; they could pay for it&#8212;they can pay for operating expenditure. So the issue is very wide-ranging.</p>

	<p pid="c.100.0/2">The Institution of Civil Engineers, the professional body for engineers and those involved in the provision of infrastructure, makes a telling point in its submission to us about the Bill. It says that the approval criteria that the Government have set out for considering schemes state clearly that</p>

	<p pid="c.100.1/1">I shall speak briefly against amendment 1, which would have the effect of limiting the definition of infrastructure to the items listed. That could mean that key elements of economic infrastructure would be omitted.

	<p pid="c.100.1/2">Those networks will be vital for future economic growth and that type of investment must be included in the scope of the Bill.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.100.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="100"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101531000938">
	<p pid="c.100.2/1">When we discussed the Bill on Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-17">17 September</phrase>, I had no idea that just one week later the River Ouse was going to rise 5 metres higher than its normal summer level and put York once again in the national and international news as a flood-prone city. I am glad to say that the emergency was well managed by the local authority, the Environment Agency, Yorkshire Water and the police, who led the silver and gold command, of course.</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/2">The consequence was far less dramatic than 12 years ago, when the Ouse rose just 10 cm higher&#8212;about 4 inches, for those who are metrically challenged. On that occasion, some 230 homes were inundated. Some homes were affected this time, but the damage was much lower, in part as a consequence of investment in flood defences and other flood alleviation schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/3">Hard flood defences have been built in the city of York to provide better protection for houses flooded during the previous high flood 12 years ago. Other alleviation measures have also been taken upstream. There has been funding to encourage farmers to build ponds&#8212;in one case, a major dam that stores millions of gallons of water during a high-flood event&#8212;and to plant more trees to slow the run-off so that the peak height is a few inches lower than it would otherwise be. I have asked the Environment Agency to calculate whether those measures made the 4 inches of difference between this occasion and 12 years ago, so preventing hundreds of thousands of pounds&#8217; worth of damage to hundreds of houses and commercial businesses, as happened then.</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/4">I should stress that throughout the flood, 99.9% of York was open for business. It gets a bad press whenever there is a flood because journalists are lazy and know that a pub called the King&#8217;s Arms in York floods four or five times a year, and it is as easy as pie to get a picture of somebody in waders pulling pints behind a bar. When people see such photos, they need to realise that York is up and running and not closed for business.</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/5">On Second Reading, I posed the question of whether the list of types of infrastructure in the Bill would include funding, or support through loan guarantees, for flood defence schemes. The Economic Secretary took advice between hearing my remarks and replying to the debate. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/6">&#8220;I am advised that there is no reason for them&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/7">that is, flood defences&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/8">&#8220;to be excluded, and we envisage their being part of the infrastructure that is being considered.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-09-17.747"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 September 2012; Vol. 550, c. 747</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/9">Since the Economic Secretary has had an opportunity to consider the matter a little further in the weeks since Second Reading and was notified by an amendment that I tabled, which has not been selected, that I would raise this issue, will he go slightly further and reassure me and other hon. Members representing constituencies with considerable flood risk that it is not that there is no reason for such schemes to be excluded, but that they will be open for consideration if it is deemed appropriate?</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/10">I say to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>, whose knowledge about these matters is enormous and whose judgment I respect&#8212;I normally consult him about matters of housing, planning or infrastructure&#8212;that I would be concerned if we limited the schemes to those of national significance. Some of the infrastructure that badly needs investment is important and will help to generate economic growth. Flood alleviation schemes, for instance, can support economic output by keeping businesses open and avoiding diverting expenditure to repairs when the funding could instead go to a future profitable investment that would generate a return.</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/11">I caution against limiting investment to matters of national significance. My right hon. Friend makes a telling point about the school door, but many schemes of local or regional, rather than national, significance ought to be candidates for consideration for the funds provided in the Bill. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will say something further about flooding and give an assurance that although we ought to be supporting schemes of national significance with this</p>
	<p pid="c.100.2/12">fund, we should not limit it to supporting such schemes and it should be open for the support of other schemes of local or regional importance.</p>

	<p pid="c.102.0/1">We have heard excellent contributions from Members on both sides of the House. The shadow Minister rightly noted that the time for the debate has been restricted. That is not unusual when we first come back after a recess, but he made a fair point. However, I was taken aback when he then went on about many different issues that did not much focus on the nature of his amendments, as he could have saved some time for hon. Members to continue with a proper debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.0/2">On the Opposition amendments, amendment 11 is designed to limit the Bill&#8217;s geographical ambit. My response is that it is clear that the scheme relies on the spending cover provided by the Bill and is designed to facilitate and accelerate infrastructure investment throughout the United Kingdom economy. The eligibility criteria have been published. For example, the guarantee scheme contains provisions requiring the infrastructure to be of national significance to the UK. Such conditions will be sufficient to achieve protection against the UK supporting other economies. If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he was concerned about the potential effect on economies outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.102.4/1">If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue, there may be time for him to contribute later.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/2">Any Government expenditure will need to satisfy the standard requirements relating to value for money, and the accounting officer will need to be satisfied about that expenditure. It is also worth noting that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40114" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase> said, making a very fair point, there may be instances where infrastructure that receives a guarantee is cross-border in nature. In those cases, we would not want to be prevented from providing financial assistance to the UK aspect of the project because of a technical limitation. I therefore beg <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/3">Amendment 9 would insert the word &#8220;childcare&#8221; after the word &#8220;health&#8221;. The amendment is unnecessary because social infrastructure, including child care, is already captured under the Bill, and so any child care facilities will be accommodated within the current definition. However, even including child care within</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/4">the definition would not ensure that a provider of child care facilities was able to obtain financial assistance under the current scheme because the application will need to fall within the ambit of one of the schemes being operated which relies on spending cover provided by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/5">At this point, I would like to deal with the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>. I well remember that he raised the issue of flood defences on Second Reading, and he is right to do so again. It shows just how deeply he is concerned about the issue on behalf of his constituents, and I respect that. I can say again that his local flood defences are not excluded within the definition in the Bill. In the case of projects of that nature, applications should be made under the process and they will be considered like all others.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/6">I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> for his kind words regarding my new position. He made two broad points. First, he rightly raised issues about overall deficit targets for the Government and their overall plan to deal with the reckless deficit inherited from the previous Government. Let me assure him that the reason we can have this programme of guarantees is the credibility that this Government have built up. Long-term interest rates and Government debt are less than half what they were when this Government came to power. That credibility is recognised by the financial markets. Sadly, the financial markets are not open for all borrowers as they were in the past. Some very viable commercial infrastructure projects cannot tap into lending in the financial markets, whether through bonds or other types of debt mechanism. The Government are using the credibility that they have built up to offer and provide these guarantees.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.4/7">That brings me to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s second point. The type of projects that are intended to be considered under the Bill are private sector-led ones that are commercially viable and creditworthy in their own right. The Government will make an assessment of each project. Let me say a bit more about how that will be done, because it is important. The Government have already set up a team within the Treasury called Infrastructure UK, which retains commercial specialists with the financial skills needed to handle a scheme of this nature. The due diligence process will involve external advisers in the same way as a financial institution, for example, would involve external advisers, and the governance structure will include expert members drawn from the private sector. At the end of this process, Infrastructure UK will have to assure Ministers that the project is commercially viable and that the only impediment to its going ahead is that it does not have the usual access to debt markets that it would have had under normal market situations. Even then, the Government will charge for a guarantee and have to be satisfied that they will not make a loss on their support for the project.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.0/1">I cannot tell the right hon. Gentleman exactly what the budget will be because that depends on the amount of work that the Infrastructure UK team is asked to do. In other words, it depends on the nature of the applications and the complexity of the projects. However, I can say that the income generated from the guarantee, and other sources of income, will be used to pay those expenses. The Government therefore do not believe that there will be a net cost in terms of the management costs of the team.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.1/1">With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the term &#8220;commercially viable&#8221; covers a multitude of sins; it could mean almost anything. One of the reasons that businesses may not be able to raise the cash from banks or in the money market is the length of the payback on the scheme. Will there be any limit on the length of payback on these commercially viable schemes, given that infrastructure investment often does not pay back for decades?</p>

	<p pid="c.104.2/1">That is a good point. There will be no limit on the length of the guarantees that the Government can issue to support the schemes because, as the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, many infrastructure projects typically require very long-dated debt which could involve a period of 20 to 30 years. There is a limit on the application time frame whereby all applications under the Bill have to come in by <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-31">31 December 2014</phrase>, but there is no limit on the debt profile that can be guaranteed.</p>

I can tell him that there have already been expressions of interest from more than 50 project sponsors and that the Government have entered into negotiations with a number of them, but no final decisions have yet been made. He will also know that, in the national infrastructure plan published last year, the Government identified numerous key projects worth more than &#163;200 billion, so there could be a substantial number of projects.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.1/1">That is a good question. It reminds me that I cannot remember any Member from Scotland or Northern Ireland being present during our lengthy debate on Second Reading. The recess was about to start, so perhaps they though it was a good opportunity to take a longer break. Let me be clear: this is a United Kingdom Government Bill. It is based on macro-economic policy, which is a reserved power for the United Kingdom Government, and takes advantage of the credit-worthiness of the United Kingdom Government. Members discussed the referendum on Scottish independence earlier, and this scheme is a great example of the strength of the United Kingdom when it works together. If we asked project sponsors in Scotland whether they would prefer a United Kingdom Government guarantee or a Scottish Government guarantee, I know which one they would pick. On deciding how those guarantees are used in devolved areas such as Scotland, the United Kingdom Government would work closely with their counterparts in the Scottish Executive, but the final decision would be for the United Kingdom Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.1/2">I do not want to say too much about amendment 10, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, because the issue has come up a number of times, but I will point out that international connectivity is an important issue for overall economic growth. This Government believe that maintaining the UK&#8217;s status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long-term international competitiveness, but we are also mindful of the need to take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity. That is why we set up the independent commission under Sir Howard Davies, which will issue its final report in the summer of 2015. Any decision on whether to support any of that report&#8217;s recommendations will be taken by the next Government. In any case, the coalition agreement is clear on this issue. That represents the Government&#8217;s position clearly, so I do not think there is any need for the amendment and ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.1/3">Amendment 4 was tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase>, who said that he raised the issue on Second Reading. I remember discussing it with him at the time and afterwards. The Government believe that the definition of &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; should be broad enough to include housing, because housing and rented homes are a fundamental part of supporting a young dynamic work force and millions of other people, as well as of increasing the overall supply of housing. Including housing in the Bill&#8217;s non-exhaustive, illustrative list makes clear our intention to introduce major investment in the UK and increase the number of houses being built and occupied.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.1/4">I reassure my hon. Friend, however, on one of his key points. In no way does this deal with planning issues or take away planning authority from local authorities. He</p>
	<p pid="c.105.1/5">should be reassured that the Localism Act 2011 is unaffected &#8212;there is no change to that&#8212;and the Government have no plans under this Bill to impose housing on any local authority with different views. This is about providing financial support for housing projects that meet the Bill&#8217;s criteria.</p>

The amendments are, however, unnecessary and I will explain why. The Bill&#8217;s purpose is to allow the Treasury, or the Secretary of State with the Treasury&#8217;s consent, to incur expenditure in support of the various infrastructure projects. Members will be aware that &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; has a plain English meaning, namely the physical facilities and installations needed for the functioning of a community or a society, such as transportation and communication systems, water and energy facilities, and public institutions, including housing, hospitals, schools and universities.</p>

	<p pid="c.106.4/1">The Minister has already confirmed that flood defences would fall under the auspices of the Bill. Will he confirm that that would also be true of a carbon capture and storage infrastructure network?</p>

	<p pid="c.106.5/1">I can confirm that CCS facilities are not excluded from the definition of infrastructure. If a project sponsor wanted to suggest such a project, it would be duly considered by the team under the scheme&#8217;s terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.5/2">Finally, it would be difficult to define &#8220;national significance&#8221; and that may take away from the overall intention of the Bill. Perhaps I do not need to make that point because it was made very well by the hon. Member for York Central. I therefore ask the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich not to press his two amendments.</p>

	<p pid="c.106.6/1">I welcome the speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>, who sought to tease out the Minister. Unfortunately, I am not sure that the Minister has provided the clarification that was sought. In clause 1, subsection (1), which</p>
	<p pid="c.106.6/2">provides that money may be provided by Parliament, is negated by subsection (5), which states that it would be provided on the say- so of the Treasury. This is a Government Bill that avoids real scrutiny by Parliament. I suspect that that is the objection of the right hon. Member for Wokingham, as well as my own.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.6/3">I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification on interconnectors and gas pipelines. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.6/4">I would ask for greater clarification on whether the &#8220;sewerage and other services&#8221; referred to in subsection (2) might apply to payment for ecosystem services along the lines of the Catskill model in the United States, whereby water bill payers in Manhattan end up paying farmers in the Catskills to maintain their land in a certain way to ensure that the purity of the water supplied to Manhattan is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.6/5">It seems to me that the reference to &#8220;operation&#8221; in subsection (3) is so wide that to call this an infrastructure Bill, in the real sense of the provision of infrastructure, is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="c.106.6/6">The Minister will not have the opportunity to respond to me at this stage, but I trust that he will be able to clarify those points on Third Reading.</p>

	<p pid="c.107.0/1">I am not satisfied by the Minister&#8217;s answer on amendment 11. Nothing in the Bill precludes the &#163;50 billion from being used largely&#8212;never mind in part&#8212;to bankroll foreign infrastructure schemes. He did not address that point carefully enough. We believe that the focus has to be on economic recovery here at home in the United Kingdom. The Minister may well believe that he would not sanction schemes that strayed beyond that, but reshuffles come and go&#8212;we could even end up with a Liberal Democrat Minister in his position. Who knows what would happen in those circumstances?</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/2">For those reasons, as well as those that I enunciated earlier, I would like to press amendment 11 to the vote.</p>

	<p pid="c.111.2/1">Amendment 7, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends, seeks to ensure that the Bill provides a safeguard for taxpayers&#8217; money. After all, &#163;50 billion of guarantees could be underwritten for the private sector on pretty much any kind of scheme, and we heard fuzzy logic from the Minister earlier, when he said that infrastructure is not quite as defined is it appears in the Bill, and that some projects could be national and some foreign.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/2">In some circumstances, underwriting can be beneficial and welcome&#8212;it can make schemes viable that were not viable previously and unlock infrastructure developments that might not otherwise take place, but in other</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/3">circumstances there are disadvantages to underwriting. Underwriting means that gains from a private endeavour are privatised, but that any losses are socialised. The entrepreneur, the shareholder and the owner of a private company or project that benefits from the safety net provided by the taxpayer could profit well for many years if a scheme bears fruit, but if the scheme goes wrong and if there are failures in it, the losses fall on you, Mr Gale, on me, on hon. Members and, most importantly, on our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/4">I make no apologies for standing up for the taxpayer&#8217;s best interests. It is important that we ensure that Ministers consider introducing clawback provisions that safeguard best value for taxpayers. The amendment is so unobjectionable that I cannot understand why the Government would object to it. The Opposition are simply saying that, in any agreement to give financial assistance, the Chancellor or Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/5">&#8220;shall give reasonable consideration to clawback provisions which safeguard the taxpayer.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/6">What do I mean by &#8220;clawback provisions&#8221;? Hon. Members who have served on the Public Accounts Committee will know that from time to time Governments have entered into contracts and sold privatised parts of the public sector. The purchasers have then gone on to make millions of pounds when they have sold on some of those assets. In this case, the guarantor has ended up facilitating a project, but the beneficiary of the guarantee went on to make significant sums.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/7">We are simply saying that the Treasury needs to make sure that there are clauses in the underwriting contracts&#8212;the offers&#8212;that ensure that if significant gains are made in the long term, the taxpayer can have a share in some of the future profits. It is a basic principle&#8212;if the taxpayer helps to create profitability for a person and bears the risk of loss, that person can reasonably be expected to share some of the excess profits with the taxpayer. It is a basic principle of prudent stewardship of taxpayers&#8217; money. It would also ensure that we deal with the question of moral hazard. We know that in some circumstances underwriting can cause difficulties if a scheme that might be shaky goes ahead as a result, which is of course a distortion of the market environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.2/8">If schemes go ahead and make significant gains and provide future returns that are in excess of what might be expected, the taxpayer could have some rights to those. For example, in a prime executive housing site in central London developed thanks in part to the Government underwriting property market risks, the units may sell at multiples of expected initial prices, with vast profits for the developer. In the current situation, what would the taxpayer get? Foreign-owned energy companies want a pipeline stretching from our shores across the continent, which could well be underwritten by the provisions in the Bill. If we fund part of that as taxpayers, but the company makes significant long-term returns on the oil and gas, what should be the taxpayers&#8217; share in that?</p>

	<p pid="c.112.0/1">Do not the Government appear to be privatising the profits, but socialising the losses? How can that be fair?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="112"  time="020:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538000706">
	<p pid="c.112.1/1">That is indeed the approach taken in some of the underwriting provisions. Of course there can be circumstances in which that makes sense, perhaps</p>
	<p pid="c.112.1/2">to tip a project that is viable and in the national interest from something that might not happen to something that moves ahead in a way that benefits everyone.</p>
	<p pid="c.112.1/3">The amendment does not even say that every contract should have a clawback provision: we are simply saying that the Treasury should be under a statutory obligation to give reasonable consideration to the insertion of clawback clauses in the contracts. That is the be all and end all of amendment 7 and I hope that the arguments are fairly straightforward. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s view.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="113"  time="020:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538000707">
	<p pid="c.113.0/1">I wish to speak briefly to amendment 12 and new clause 3, which are both in my name. Both relate to the reports that the Government propose in clause 3 should be annually produced, and to the transparency of the companies involved in this support for infrastructure, which I welcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/2">Both the amendment and the new clause follow discussions that I have had with my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, who is now in his place on the Front Bench with his new ministerial colleague, whom I also welcome. The amendment and new clause are prompted by the fact that we often do not know the identities of the beneficial owners of the companies with which the Government do business. Companies often have shares owned by trusts or other companies based in countries that do not require disclosure of ownership, and I shall give a few examples.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/3">The M6 toll road is owned by Midland Expressway Ltd, which is owned in turn by the Macquarie Motorways Group Ltd, which is in turn owned by Macquarie Atlas Roads International Ltd of Bermuda. It is controlled by Macquarie Infrastructure Group, but the identity of its investors and therefore of the owners of MEL remains unknown and undisclosed. In 2006, however, they paid themselves a &#163;392 million exceptional dividend, and over six years made a return on their investment of more than 150% a year. This sort of profit at the public&#8217;s expense by we know not whom is not an acceptable arrangement, and I want the Government to be warned against it and to ensure that all owners are in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/4">Arqiva, as a private sector monopoly, is regulated by Ofcom. It runs all the transmission services for all UK terrestrial television broadcasters and for BBC Radio and most commercial radio services, owns two of the four digital multiplexes, supplies the Government with mobile and wireless communications and supplies three quarters of all police forces. It receives annual revenues of about &#163;1 billion and makes annual losses of about &#163;250 million. The ultimate owners of the company appear to be based in Bermuda, although we do not know who they are, and Arqiva has paid no corporation tax for four years.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/5">Thames Water, the UK&#8217;s largest water supplier and a monopoly private sector company providing a public service with which the public therefore has no option but to deal was bought by Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund in 2006. The long-term debt held by the company was &#163;3.4 billion and is now &#163;7.7 billion. When the company was bought, Thames Water took on all the debt taken out by its owners to buy the company, which was more than &#163;3 billion. To do that, it set up a</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/6">company in the Cayman islands, Thames Water Utilities Cayman Finance Ltd, which is registered at an address at which are registered 18,000 other companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.0/7">Over the past four years, Thames Water has made profits after tax of &#163;314 million, &#163;331 million, &#163;225 million and &#163;247 million, and has paid dividends of &#163;398 million, &#163;291 million, &#163;271 million and &#163;480 million, but in the last tax year paid no tax. In the previous year, it paid &#163;500,000 in tax, and the year before that &#163;16 million, yet it has a stable operating profit of about &#163;600 million a year. I could go on. There are health care companies, and the company currently negotiating with the London fire brigade over the water to buy the old fire brigade headquarters looks as if it is based in the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>

	<p pid="c.114.2/1">On a point of order, Mr Gale. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman. Surely, the point of a Committee stage is to allow a Bill to be considered at greater length and in greater detail than is possible on Second Reading. Owing to reasons beyond your control, Mr Gale, we have less than half the time for debate in Committee that we had on Second Reading. We have not yet finished clause 1. All the other clauses will go unconsidered in Committee. Would it be in order, Mr Gale, for you to make a report to the Chairman of Ways and Means about how this Committee stage went, so that he and the Panel of Chairs can consider whether it is appropriate for us to have such short Committee stages on the Floor of the whole House?</p>

	<p pid="c.118.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">We have had an excellent and informative debate. I am grateful to everyone who has taken part in scrutiny of this important Bill and to members of all parties who have contributed as it has passed through the House, and I am grateful for the constructive, thoughtful and considered approach that has been adopted by most Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/3">When the global crisis hit, the United Kingdom was among the hardest hit. Our recession was among the deepest, our deficit was among the largest, and our challenge to deliver sustainable recovery was among the greatest. The Government have set out a comprehensive strategy to deal with the challenges that we face. Fiscal, monetary, tax and structural reform are all playing their role to deliver our objective of lasting recovery and sustainable public finances. That strategy has reduced the deficit and helped to deliver near-record low interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.118.0/4">As a result of the tough decisions that the Government have made and the responsibility and credibility of our long-term fiscal plans, the UK is a safe haven in a global debt storm. Ten-year gilt interest rates are now 1.9%, less than half what they were when we came to power. We are in a position to help unlock private sector infrastructure investment because of the strength and credibility of the UK Government&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40239" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="119"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001221">
	<p pid="c.119.0/1">May I briefly develop a point that I raised earlier? The Minister confirmed then that the Bill was a UK-wide measure, and that funding from the scheme would be provided for all parts of the UK from the Treasury. Will he now confirm that it will be possible for a private sector project in my constituency in Edinburgh to apply directly to the Treasury for support, without needing to go through the Scottish Government?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.119.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="119"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001222">
	<p pid="c.119.1/1">Yes, I can confirm that any application will go directly to the UK Treasury. If an application were made by one of the devolved areas, the Treasury would consider working with its counterparts in that area, but the decision would be made by the Treasury itself.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.119.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="119"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001223">
	<p pid="c.119.2/1">As my hon. Friend knows, my colleagues and I support the Bill strongly. May I give him a chance to deal with a point that he did not have a chance to deal with earlier? Will any investment made through the arrangements in the Bill allow the Government to track down the beneficial owners of any companies with which we do business, and to find out where they are based? May I also ask whether the due diligence rules that are set out in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 will be applied, so that there will be a check on the interest rates, the creditworthiness and the ethics of the companies in question?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.119.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="119"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001224">
	<p pid="c.119.3/1">My right hon. Friend began to make his point in the earlier debate, but was unfortunately cut short. The Government are keen to ensure that when they analyse each application that will benefit from these guarantees, they establish the identities of the true beneficial owners of every scheme. Although that process is not included in what was deliberately designed to be a short Bill, much of the detail is included in the individual</p>
	<p pid="c.119.3/2">schemes. It will be in the UK guarantees scheme, and also in the programme that will cover the housing element of the guarantees, which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.3/3">My right hon. Friend also raised a point, in relation to one of his amendments, about the beneficiaries of the debt guarantees. He may have been alluding to the actual holders of the debt instruments. Although I understand and sympathise with his principle, this approach would not be very practical because debt instruments, particularly bonds, are tradeable and so, as with gilts, it would be hard to track the owners of those instruments.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001225">
	<p pid="c.120.0/1">I am glad that the Minister was addressing the important amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, but I wish to focus on transparency in respect of not only the beneficiaries, but the person receiving financial assistance. The Minister will know that, because of the knife, we did not get to my amendment asking for the details of the persons receiving some of this funding to be placed in the public domain. Will he give a commitment that that information&#8212;the details of those beneficiaries&#8212;will be made public?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001226">
	<p pid="c.120.1/1">The process of analysing each of the applications under the Bill will include a thorough due diligence process, which will examine the beneficiaries in each case. The Government will not issue a guarantee if they are not satisfied with the outcome of that due diligence process. It is not the standard procedure for the Government to publish all the information they look at when making decisions on guarantees, but the hon. Gentleman should be assured that this will be a very thorough process, which will have the assistance of outside sources if required.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001227">
	<p pid="c.120.2/1">It may be helpful that, at a date in the near future, friends from all parties might have an opportunity to talk through these things with the Minister when the other scheme on housing is published. May I alert him to the fact that the due diligence tests under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 are, by objective assessment, not always effectively applied by the banks? So it is all very well having the tests in theory, but we need to ensure that the tests for this Bill are carried out in practice and that we can all see that they are effective and as stringent as they were meant to be.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001228">
	<p pid="c.120.3/1">My right hon. Friend makes a fair point, and I am more than happy to discuss this in further detail with him at a later stage.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" speakername="John Healey" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001229">
	<p pid="c.120.4/1">The Minister was boasting before the last interventions about near-record-low interest rates of 1.9%. What does he think about the judgment of that by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase>, who was trusted and appointed by the Chancellor to be his party&#8217;s member of the LIBOR investigation committee? He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.120.4/2">&#8220;The reason we have a low interest rate is because the economy is absolutely screwed.&#8221;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.120.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="120"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0003.htm#12101538001230">
	<p pid="c.120.5/1">We have low interest rates because, for once, we have a Government who actually understand public finances. Less than an hour ago, the shadow Financial Secretary, in introducing his latest amendment, said that he was concerned about the use of taxpayers&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="c.120.5/2">money&#8212;I had to have a little chuckle to myself, because what happened to that during 13 years of Labour government? Our national debt tripled. He also talked about clawbacks, and there is one clawback I would be interested to learn about. When the previous Government sold off our precious gold reserves, did they negotiate a clawback at that point? I do not think so.</p>

	<p pid="c.121.1/1">I will plough on.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/2">The Government are committed to delivering a sustainable, private sector-led recovery that is balanced across industrial sectors and across geographical regions. To achieve that ambition, the Government are committed to delivering world-class infrastructure. Firms will have access to the communications and transport networks that they need, wherever in the UK they happen to be, thus enabling Britain to compete on the world stage. Our national infrastructure plan sets out an ambitious but credible road map to deliver on that vision&#8212;a &#163;200 billion pipeline of upcoming investment in key, large-scale projects, of which more than two thirds will, typically, be financed and delivered by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/3">A number of key infrastructure projects are close to starting construction but are being delayed because of the difficulties they face in securing the finance and investment that they require, and the housing market continues to suffer from an under-supply of homes in key areas. Even under favourable credit conditions, raising the amount of private finance required to deliver these projects and to meet these goals would be a challenge. However, the disruption caused by the instability of international financial markets and its adverse effect on long-term debt provision makes it clear that proactive, decisive action is needed now. The Bill will allow us to take that action and bring forward the investment that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.1/4">As hon. Members will know, the principal aim of the Bill is to facilitate headline schemes for infrastructure and housing investment, to accelerate and bring forward significant investment in major UK infrastructure projects and to increase the number of homes being built and occupied. Through the Bill, guarantees provided by Government will help to ensure that when projects are struggling to access private finance due to adverse credit conditions they can now go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.122.1/1">As always, my hon. and learned Friend makes a fantastic point and I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.1/2">The Government have agreed in principle, and subject to strict approvals criteria, to make financial support available to infrastructure projects, using the strength and credibility of our balance sheet to support the investment we need. The Treasury and the Secretary of State already have common law power to issue guarantees, make loans, and give other financial assistance. In addition, in some cases, Secretaries of State have express statutory powers to support infrastructure. However, the Treasury does not have authority to incur expenditure in relation to guarantees on the scale that I have outlined. Moreover, Members will know that there is a long-standing convention dating back to 1932 that Government should not rest significant and regular expenditure under common law powers on the sole authority of general supply legislation. So, to achieve the crucial level of financial support required for key infrastructure projects, we need new primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.1/3">The legislation authorises the Treasury and, where appropriate, the Secretary of State, to incur expenditure for providing financial assistance. The Bill will allow the Government to support crucial investment in key areas of economic and public service infrastructure. That will include utilities, such as energy and telecommunications; transport, such as railways and roads; infrastructure to provide public services, such as hospitals and schools; and housing development to deliver much-needed homes. We estimate that up to &#163;40 billion of investment in infrastructure and an additional &#163;10 billion in housing investment could be accelerated under the UK guarantee scheme using the powers in the Bill. Importantly, we will put in place strict guidelines and eligibility criteria for the schemes to protect the taxpayer and ensure the Exchequer does not take on unacceptable fiscal risks.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.1/4">In Committee, I was asked about application time frames. Let me clarify that the time frames are detailed in the scheme rules, not on the face of the Bill. Any proposal that receives an infrastructure guarantee will, as a minimum, have satisfied the requirements to be nationally or economically significant; financially credible; good value for money for the taxpayer; not solely dependent on a guarantee to proceed; and ready to start construction within 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.1/5">The projects we expect to back will be structured to minimise potential losses to the Exchequer, so there will be a minimal impact on public sector net borrowing as a result. The exception is under the extreme circumstances that a guarantee is called upon or other forms of financial assistance are provided. Furthermore, we will levy a commercial charge for the services received by infrastructure providers, ensuring that companies pay a fair price for the benefits they receive and taxpayers receive a fair price for any risk being taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.1/6">We have designed the UK guarantee scheme to ensure that critical infrastructure projects receive the investment they urgently require.</p>

	<p pid="c.123.0/1">Further to the Minister&#8217;s earlier clarification, will he assure us that any moneys committed or guaranteed to support an infrastructure project in a devolved area will be truly and fully additional to allocations under the Barnett formula, or will some subsequent adjustments be sought?</p>

	<p pid="c.123.1/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the commitments for guarantees or other moneys used under the Bill will have nothing to do with the Barnett formula and that it will be true and genuine assistance from the United Kingdom Government for any area of the United Kingdom, including the devolved areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.123.1/2">In conclusion, I believe that this is an important and much-needed Bill. It will allow critical infrastructure projects that are being held back by adverse credit conditions to proceed. It contains measures that will support growth, jobs and families, all at a minimal cost to the taxpayer. It will support the UK&#8217;s construction sector by providing access to finance for financially credible and high-value-for-money projects. It will help unlock the investment that the UK requires, it will help make the UK one of the predominant places in the world to do business, and it will support sustainable growth that is balanced across sectors and regions. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.123.2/1">Although the Opposition will not oppose the Bill on Third Reading, we do not think that the matter should rest there. It is not the most impressive Bill ever placed before this august Chamber. The Minister said that he was grateful for the excellent and informative debate we have had so far, but we had a pretty farcical two hours of scrutiny in Committee; we managed to debate only clause 1 and had no debate on a third of the amendments that were tabled. I think the Government showed a large measure of disrespect to the process of parliamentary scrutiny in the way they misallocated time for today&#8217;s discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.123.2/2">This legislation is very much in the frame of mind of the &#8220;wait and see&#8221; game we are used to seeing from the Chancellor and the Treasury team. They hope that something will crop up but are not exactly sure what. The Minister said that he hoped there would be some expressions of interest in something or other but that, ultimately, he cannot predict the future. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> asked the killer question: what will be the measure of success for the Bill? What answer did the Minister give? Essentially he said, &#8220;We cannot not really predict that, but we are confident that projects will come forward, so judge for yourself.&#8221; That is a totally embarrassing and appalling way of managing and advocating what should be a far more sophisticated approach to making public and economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.123.2/3">The country deserves far better than the &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach from Ministers. Surely there should be some semblance of projections for how the Bill will be deployed and some way of gauging what that interest is, rather than just putting it out there and hoping that something will happen. But of course we must not forget that the Bill is in large part a device to make it look as though the Government are actually busy. There is one effective sentence in clause 1 that covers the blushes of the accounting officers so that underwriting</p>
	<p pid="c.123.2/4">arrangements can span various financial years, but essentially this is makey-uppy, make-work legislation to make the Government look determined and busy in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="c.123.2/5">Do not forget that we will have a growth Bill in due course, although we are still not clear what will be in it. The Prime Minister famously said that we cannot legislate for growth, so we will see what becomes of that Bill.</p>

The Minister could not say that that information would be in the public domain. We are not even necessarily allowed to know to whom the financial assistance is being given.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.1/3">The Minister says that due diligence will be thorough as far as the Treasury is concerned, but what about the rest of us? Our constituents send us here to keep an eye on what the Executive are doing with public money. Without that basic information, how are we to judge the success of the legislation?</p>

I remember many occasions when we had exactly the same problem under the Labour Government. Rather than blaming the Government, will he and his colleagues work with us to make sure that we have a system across Parliament&#8212;just a change in the rules that gives injury time if urgent questions or statements take up time for principal legislation? That is a way of solving the problem, and we would all be much happier as a result.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.3/1">Of course we can have arrangements. There are perfectly available arrangements for making sure that there is time for legislation, but the Opposition do not control the timetabling of debates. I do not want to bang on about the procedure, but suffice it to say that it was inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/2">We did not get a chance to debate the reporting mechanisms for what happens in terms of the financial assistance given to unknown persons. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40535" name="Stephen Phillips">The hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen Phillips)</phrase> asked what measure we would have of the Bill&#8217;s success. I think that there should be reports not every 12 months, but every six months. If the issue is so urgent and there is a national emergency&#8212;if it is a</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/3">case of, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get infrastructure going and press ahead with capital investment&#8221;&#8212;let us have far more frequent reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/4">We do not know how much taxpayers&#8217; money is on the line, how much is being committed per project, what form the financial assistance will commonly take, what type of companies will receive the financial assistance and even what type of infrastructure projects will receive such assistance. There are a lot of unknown unknowns in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/5">I hoped that we would have the chance to cover other key points. For example, I am particularly concerned about the availability of social housing. I mentioned earlier that in my city of Nottingham, not a single extra affordable social house was built in the last financial year. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/6">Perhaps the situation will be made worse by the fact that the housing stock of certain local authorities has been transferred to housing associations, but quite a number of authorities either retain their council housing stock or have arm&#8217;s length management organisations, or ALMOs, doing that. As I read the legislation, if someone&#8217;s local authority has not moved to housing associations, they will not be able to benefit from the underwriting as much as people whose local authorities have, because ALMOs and local authority-retained stock areas cannot be underwritten because of the borrowing constraints. There is a perfectly legitimate question&#8212;not a partisan question&#8212;about how we ensure fairness from one city to another and one area to another, but we did not get an opportunity to debate those issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.0/1">I am pleased that the shadow Minister is now concerned about social housing for his constituents, because perhaps he can explain to them why, during his party&#8217;s 13 years in government, the number of social houses fell by a net 421,000 and the number of people on the social housing waiting list went up from 1 million to 1.8 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.1/1">If the Minister were talking on the basis of having made some progress or having reached some level of achievement as regards housing policy, perhaps he would have the right to start throwing accusations about. Of course, far more could and should have been done in the past, but after two and a half years under his party&#8217;s Administration, where are we going on housing construction? According to the Construction Products Association, it is going through the floor; &#8220;free-fall&#8221; is the phrase linked to the CPA in this morning&#8217;s <i>Financial </i> <i>Times</i>.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In particular, social housing construction, which was the subject of the Minister&#8217;s intervention, has plummeted by 25% in the past year. That is the direction it is going in under this Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.125.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="125"  time="021:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001247">
	<p pid="c.125.3/1">Exactly; my right hon. Friend is right. Official data show that construction output is down by 11.6% on the year before, and the Construction Products Association predicts a 13% fall in infrastructure investment this year. When one starts to look at what is actually happening in the real economy and the real world today, it is clearly not about the announcements that Ministers bring to the Chamber as though they represent</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/2">reality. The Bill may well go on to the statute book after this debate, but if the Government are relying on it alone, we remain concerned that the infrastructure schemes for housing, schools, child care, transport and so forth which should be proceeding will not move forward as effectively as they should.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/3">There are other concerns that the Minister has not addressed, perhaps because the Government do not have an implementation plan that they can allude to. For example, they have not talked about state aid clearance. The Bill says that financial assistance can be given to particular industries and private sector ventures in operations, in maintenance and in repairs, but perhaps to the exclusion of other companies. What is the Government&#8217;s approach to state aid clearance from the European Union? If they hit such a barrier in the EU, will they simply say, &#8220;Well, another month, another quarter, another year has gone by and we didn&#8217;t get state aid clearance&#8221;? How are they approaching those barriers, and when will they report to Parliament about how they are going to tackle these issues? Those are more obstacles that they do not appear to have addressed in any way.</p>

	<p pid="c.126.0/1">Does my hon. Friend perceive that under the Bill there is a risk of the UK Government granting guarantees to companies in a way that would mean that those companies could gazump other projects that had been developed, perhaps in devolved areas, and come in on a pretty anti-competitive basis, not only constraining the choices of devolved Administrations but ruining the chances and prospects of companies that were working on projects and making good offers in those areas?</p>

	<p pid="c.126.1/1">That is the sort of point that should have arisen if we had had the opportunity properly to scrutinise the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/2">Most people observing the Government and the workings of Parliament from outside assume that there is a level of sophistication in the Treasury and that the people there must have a level of intellect and capability that is somehow superior to the rest of us. They do not realise that when one looks inside the Treasury it is clear that those people are crossing their fingers, holding their breath, and making it up as they go along. This back-of-a-fag-packet approach to legislation simply will not do. This country&#8217;s growth prospects have been worsened by this Administration&#8217;s policies. As the former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, wrote in the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning, economies that become stuck in a vicious circle of austerity and stagnation will find it ever harder to deal with their deficits and stabilise public finances.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/3">The Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s out-turn figures show that the Government are cutting capital expenditure by more than &#163;6 billion more than the previous Government planned. Combined with other austerity measures, this has resulted in a collapse in infrastructure investment. More than 119,000 construction sector jobs have been lost so far, and according to the Construction Industry Training Board the Government are spending &#163;8 billion more in benefits for the 188,000 unemployed construction workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/4">Borrowing is not falling, but rising this year&#8212;it is up 22% in the first five months of this financial year compared with last year. This Government are borrowing</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/5">not to pay for investment and positive development, but to pay for the failures of their economic plan and to cover the costs of considerable increases in welfare in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/6">We need an alternative that focuses on action today and that understands that we need to introduce&#8212;really introduce&#8212;some of the capital schemes, roll up our sleeves and get on with them. The 4G mobile spectrum auction will take place soon and we hope that it will yield at least &#163;3 billion. Let us put that money towards 100,000 new homes and put some serious investment into infrastructure. Let us build on some of the successes that we know Britain can deliver on infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/7">There is a complete mismatch between the Government&#8217;s words and their actions: our infrastructure is deteriorating, not improving; construction work is down, not up; and hundreds of thousands of young people are languishing on benefits while businesses delay the investment needed to maintain their competitiveness and market share. That is just not good enough and much more is needed than the vagaries of this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.0/1">The Minister opened his Third Reading speech by claiming that we had had an excellent debate. If only! He must have had his tongue in his cheek when he said that. We have had a shockingly truncated debate in which only one group of amendments has been properly debated. The second group received only a perfunctory opportunity for debate, and that was cut short by the timetable at 9 pm. That left no time for any debate on three of the Bill&#8217;s four clauses. Frankly, that is not an adequate performance and I hope that conclusions will be drawn in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/2">When I intervened on the Minister to ask what success criteria had been set to assess the Bill&#8217;s effectiveness, after a rather telling pause in which he had difficulty identifying success criteria, he referred me to the provision for annual reports, thereby neatly highlighting the fact that we had not had a debate about the frequency of the reports. I tabled an amendment to have those reports at six-monthly intervals, in order to make the point that the urgency for action to stimulate investment in infrastructure required a more accelerated timetable than the leisurely one proposed by the Government. Of course, we had no chance to debate that amendment, because it related to clause 3, which we never reached.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/3">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> rightly emphasised, the Minister&#8217;s response to our request for a definition of the success measures was essentially one of &#8220;Wait and see&#8221;. Frankly, this country cannot afford to wait and see. We are facing a serious economic crisis, which is more acute in the construction sector than in almost any other sector of our economy, and the serious problems affecting the construction industry are impacting more widely on the whole economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/4">Urgent action to stimulate construction investment is absolutely vital. In theory, the Government are aware of that, because the Bill&#8217;s explanatory notes start with reference to the need for fast-track legislation. The notes ask:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/5">&#8220;Why is fast-tracking necessary?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/6">They go on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/7">&#8220;The financial assistance is designed to assist infrastructure projects that may find it difficult to obtain private finance&#8230;The Government understand that there are currently commercially and economically viable infrastructure projects that are stalled because they cannot secure private finance. The timing of the UK&#8217;s proposed financial assistance is currently unclear, but the evidence indicates that there are projects that might be waiting only for finance before they can proceed to the construction phase.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/8">That may well be correct. We share the Government&#8217;s stated objective of bringing forward and accelerating the necessary investment. However, if that is the case, why can the Government not name a single project that stands ready and waiting to receive the benefit of the financial guarantees offered by the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/9">In July, Lord Sassoon, speaking for the Government, referred to &#163;40 billion-worth of projects that were ready to go by the autumn. I put it to the Minister that we are now in the autumn. If we are to see a significant proportion of that &#163;40 billion of investment reasonably soon, we need to know very soon what those projects are. I put it to the Minister and to all Government Members from both coalition parties that it is not good enough to talk about good intentions but fail to come forward with concrete, practical proposals, particularly when they have said that the projects are shovel-ready and that it is only the lack of financial support from the private sector that is holding them back. They have said that the Bill is here to unlock that potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.0/10">I repeat my question to the Minister: what are the success criteria? We believe that one measure of success would be a considerable increase in the investment in infrastructure. Back in 2009, in the depths of recession, investment in infrastructure was running at about &#163;11.5 billion. That was the highest level for 20 years and was an indication of the previous Government&#8217;s commitment to infrastructure investment as one of the measures to deal with recession. Investment in infrastructure is now down to &#163;8.6 billion and further falls are forecast. That is the record of the present Government. They have presided over a catastrophic fall in construction activity. Infrastructure, which was one of the few parts of the construction sector to survive the worst of the recession in the early years, is also falling. The industry is desperate for assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.128.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman refers to the record of the present Government, but it was under the previous Government that house building fell to its lowest level since 1923 and 1924. Why does he not welcome the action that this Government are taking in the way that it should be welcomed?</p>

	<p pid="c.128.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman clearly did not listen to the contribution of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>, who pointed out that house building levels have gone down further under this Government. The levels are now at their lowest since the 1920s and are lower than when the Government came to office.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/2">The sad thing is that when the Government came to office, the housing sector was recovering. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It was recovering. If Government Members look at the statistics, they will see that in&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> They clearly do not want to listen to the statistics. In the second quarter of 2010, there were more than 30,000 new starts</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/3">in the housing sector. That was a recovery from the depths of recession. Since then, that level has never been matched. In the latest quarter, the number of starts was down to 23,000&#8212;a level that is consistent with an output of less than 100,000 in any one year. That is a shameful record, for which this Government are responsible. I say to Government Members that, for all their bravado and posture, their record is a shameful one and will hang around their necks as the British electorate come to see just what a mess their failed policies have left.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/4">In conclusion, this is a Bill that we cannot object to in principle, because investment in infrastructure and housing is vital. Sadly, it is a Bill that, on the evidence that we have heard tonight, will not deliver what the Government say they would like to see and what Opposition Members would dearly love to see: increased investment in infrastructure and housing. The country needs it and the industry needs it. Sadly, I fear that the Bill promises it, but will not deliver it. Only time will tell, but the Government&#8217;s failure to respond adequately on the question of the success criteria speaks volumes about how this is a triumph of spin over substance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" speakername="John Healey" colnum="129"  time="021:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001253">
	<p pid="c.129.0/1">I had not planned to speak on Third Reading, but I have been moved to do so by how seriously the Committee stage was curtailed this afternoon. For the entire Committee stage on the Floor of the House, we have had less time than a single sitting of a Public Bill Committee. I put it to the Economic Secretary that proper scrutiny would have done a great service to the objectives of a Bill as important as this, on which the Government are rightly looking to build a consensus in the House and beyond. I say that not least because those with an interest, who will have to finance, plan, deliver and make decisions about the big infrastructure projects that our country needs, could have had the chance to give evidence to the Public Bill Committee. That would not have held the Government up for long, but it would have made the Bill and the debate on it a great deal better.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/2">We did not reach some amendments and new clauses today, but I hope that the Economic Secretary and his colleagues in another place will seriously consider amendment 3, tabled by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>, about the frequency of reports; amendment 12 and new clause 3, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, on transparency, due diligence and the tracing of beneficial owners; and new clause 1, tabled by my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, on social and affordable housing. The Economic Secretary gave the House the impression that he cared about that matter, so I hope he will take that suggested provision seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/3">I do not just say, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich did, that I can find little to object to in the Bill; I positively welcome the aims behind it, and I will welcome action should it follow</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/4">from the Bill&#8217;s provisions. It makes sound sense to make the private sector balance sheet support the public sector balance sheet and bring the two together, especially at a time when public finances are limited and normal lending is constrained.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/5">The principles and aims of the Bill are sound, but the question remains whether the Government can put schemes in place in a way that is simple enough and speedy enough to ensure that the necessary action follows. The Economic Secretary will have to forgive me if I have a certain amount of scepticism about that. After all, it is almost a year since the Prime Minister promised</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/6">&#8220;an all-out mission to unblock the system and get projects under way&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/7">and almost two years since the Government published their first national infrastructure plan. It is almost two and a half years since they set up the Infrastructure UK unit in the Treasury, which the Economic Secretary has mentioned today, with its remit to</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/8">&#8220;provide a stronger focus on the UK&#8217;s long-term infrastructure priorities and meet the challenge of facilitating significant private sector investment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/9">It has been so long, and there has been so little action, that business, investors and industry are all understandably losing confidence in the Government&#8217;s ability to act. That was reflected in the CBI&#8217;s annual infrastructure survey published recently, which concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/10">&#8220;The message to Government is a wake-up call that businesses in Britain are looking for action and we haven&#8217;t seen any yet.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/11">It found that business and industry were less confident about the Government&#8217;s ability to drive investment into crucial transport, energy, water and waste projects than they were a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/12">I hope that the Bill will be part of a proper rebalancing of the British economy, and that the Economic Secretary will recognise that investment is currently heavily skewed towards London and the south-east. I hope he will take seriously his own interest in seeing a cross-party consensus because, in the end, long-term infrastructure projects do not correspond to our political cycle&#8212;they require cross-party consistency, confidence and consensus. If the Bill can contribute to that, it will build a sound basis for that consensus for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/13" class="italic">Question put and agreed  <i>to</i> .</p>
	<p pid="c.129.0/14" class="italic">Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.2/1">I applied for this debate before Parliament adjourned for the conference recess, and my application was triggered by the decision by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs to close eight in-house nurseries on its estate, without any debate, consultation or negotiation. Things have moved on significantly during the intervening period, but many old and new questions remain unanswered so this debate remains pertinent and necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/2">I know that the Minister is committed to child care. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-17">17 October 2011</phrase>, he told the House that the Government&#8217;s strategy on child care and work involved</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/3">&#8220;encouraging parents into work by promoting safe, good quality child care and providing incentives and wider options to encourage more employers to support child care provisions for their staff.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-10-17.686"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 October 2011; Vol. 533, c. 686W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/4">I fear, however, that the Government&#8217;s commitment has not cascaded down to senior civil servants in HMRC, and I will explain why by providing a whistle-stop tour of events.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/5">In late August, HMRC advised that it had unilaterally decided to close eight nurseries that were part of a relationship between HMRC, Mapeley Estates Ltd, which owns some of the HMRC estate, and Bright Horizons, the actual nursery provider. As hon. Members will understand, my immediate concern was for the welfare of the 86 families whose children attended the custom-built nursery inside HMRC East Kilbride in my constituency. In my mind&#8217;s eye, I imagined that HMRC would have done its homework, and that I would be presented with incontrovertible evidence that the nursery was grossly inefficient, or that the number of children using the facility was too low to sustain in-house provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/6">It was, therefore, with some trepidation that I wrote to HMRC to find out its reasons for the proposed closures. I received a response from Mr Mike Falvey, the chief people officer at HMRC, who&#8212;for reasons that will become obvious&#8212;probably holds the most inappropriate job title in the civil service. In his letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-05">5 September</phrase>, Mr Falvey explained that the current contract between Bright Horizons and Mapeley originally ran for five years, but had been extended twice and could not be extended again. He advised that a further contract needed to be retendered, which HMRC had chosen not to do.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.3/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. Early in the process he describes, he and I discussed this matter, primarily because my constituents were also affected and were involved in some of the changes. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the period of notice given was truly appalling&#8212;three months to locate young children elsewhere&#8212;and that inadequate thought was given by HMRC about how it should try to help a commercial solution?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.131.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40228" speakername="Michael McCann" colnum="131"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001256">
	<p pid="c.131.4/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman, and I think he will be even more appalled as I continue with my remarks. Not only did Mr Falvey advise that a</p>
	<p pid="c.131.4/2">future contract needed to be re-tendered&#8212;something HMRC had chosen not to do&#8212;he further advised that there were only eight nurseries for more than 300 HMRC offices, and that HMRC did not provide the same child care service for all staff. Finally, he advised that the number of parents using the nurseries was declining and, most importantly, that only a third of spaces were taken by children of HMRC staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.4/3">There was only one problem: none of that information&#8212;provided by a civil servant who is paid more than the Prime Minister&#8212;was accurate. I found out several weeks later that the deal between Mapeley and Bright Horizons&#8212;the hon. Gentleman might want to listen carefully to this point&#8212;contained a provision for an extension of an additional year, to November 2013, which was never disclosed to me by civil servants. I also found out that, even if the eight in-house nurseries run by Bright Horizons were closed by HMRC, it would still have in-house nurseries, including a large one in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40420" name="Nick Brown">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown)</phrase>. Finally&#8212;I consider this to be the pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance&#8212;I found out that 63 of the 86 children at the nursery in my constituency were the children of HMRC staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.0/1">My hon. Friend sets out a powerful case. I understand that the nursery at Castle Meadow in my constituency currently has a 76% occupancy rate, that more than half of its users are HMRC staff, and that its outdoor play area has only recently been upgraded. Does he agree that that calls into question the account hon. Members have been given of a service in decline?</p>

	<p pid="c.132.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. It also calls into question the decision taken&#8212;the account I was given was riddled with similar inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/2">Armed with the knowledge that the HMRC rationale for the closure in my constituency was fallacious, I called Mr Falvey and explained that the arguments he had presented were plain wrong. I asked whether, in the light of reality, he would agree to my modest request to review the decision in full or in part. The chief people officer refused point blank to do so. To digress ever so slightly, it is not difficult to see why HMRC came 36th out of 37 Government Departments last year in the industrial relations league table. Perhaps it is going for 37th place this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/3">After that setback, I contacted the Minister&#8217;s office to arrange to discuss the matter, feeling strongly that senior civil servants could not dismiss the concerns of elected Members of Parliament in such a shoddy manner, particularly as their decision to shut the nurseries was obviously based in full or in part on erroneous information. Alas, the Minister refused to meet me, claiming that the issue I wanted to discuss was operational. No further explanation was provided by his private office.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/4">When hon. Members are running out of cards to play, politics can be frustrating. However, if you do not mind an &#8220;It&#8217;s a Knockout&#8221; analogy, Mr Speaker, I played my joker and applied for an Adjournment debate just before hon. Members packed up and left for the recess. Whatever gods exist, be they mortal or otherwise, my debate topic was picked for this evening. However, I did not want to wait until this evening&#8212;I wanted a resolution&#8212;and had a duty to look after my constituents</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/5">and their children, so I once again pressed HMRC and set up a call with Lin Homer, chief executive of HMRC. Miss Homer was previously chief executive of the UK Border Agency and permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, where she worked on the west coast main line contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/6">I spent 45 minutes on the telephone with Miss Homer on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-21">21 September</phrase>, only to find that the reason HMRC wanted to close nurseries had nothing to do with the reasons set out in Mr Falvey&#8217;s <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-05">5 September</phrase> letter. I was advised for the first time that the decision was being made to rationalise the HMRC estate to save money on rent.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, for co-ordinating the letter and for showing leadership. Does he agree that one strange thing with regard to the estate is that the buildings will remain empty? That is another reason why the closures need to be looked at again, and why there should be a moratorium on them until we get the real facts so we can make a proper decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.1/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman&#8212; I shall expand on that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/2">I was advised for the first time that the decision to rationalise the HMRC estate was based on saving money on rent. Despite my reasonable request for a review and my suggestion on how to keep the nurseries open under new arrangements, Miss Homer confirmed that the closures would go ahead regardless.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/3">The new information did not make any difference to the nursery in my constituency and others, as hon. Members have said. I shall suspend disbelief to explain why. The nursery contract is between Mapeley Estates and Bright Horizons. HMRC provides the space for free as part of its now-defunct commitment to family-friendly policies. It planned to shut the nursery in my constituency and leave 86 families&#8212;63 of them HMRC families&#8212;searching for new child care provision. What was to happen to the vacant space in East Kilbride, on which the taxpayer would continue to pay rent? Absolutely nothing. HMRC would continue to pay the full rent to Mapeley until at least 2015, the only difference being that a wonderful, fully equipped, custom-built nursery would lie empty, gathering cobwebs. Mr Speaker, you could not make it up.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/4">In view of the new information, I made a further request to meet the Minister, and this time my request was granted. Lo and behold, a decision has now been made to keep the nursery in my constituency, and another in Cardiff, open.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.2/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#8217;s tenacity in pursuing this issue and I am, of course, delighted that the nurseries in East Kilbride and Cardiff will remain open. But the one in Leicester&#8217;s Saxon house will not remain open, even though it is oversubscribed and there are 15 staff on maternity leave who will want to use the nursery when they return to work. Does he agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.134.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40228" speakername="Michael McCann" colnum="134"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001262">
	<p pid="c.134.0/1">I agree entirely, and the rest of my contribution will explain why that is something that the Minister should actively consider.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/2">The decision to keep two nurseries open was confirmed to me when I met the Minister and chief executive on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-03">3 October</phrase>. I have some remaining issues that I wish the Minister to address. The first is the package offered by HMRC to keep East Kilbride and Cardiff open. It is based on my original proposition to Lin Homer, offered on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-21">21 September</phrase>, that the accommodation could and should be utilised as a nursery until at least 2015, under new arrangements. However, that offer was made in ignorance of the knowledge that a clause already existed that would enable the eight nurseries to remain open for a further year, to November 2013. I therefore make a formal request to the Minister this evening to review the package offered on the grounds that his civil servants apparently did not know that the clause to extend the lease existed. This new information should allow all the nurseries to operate for a further year on the current terms and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/3">My second request to the Minister relates to the behaviour of his senior civil servants. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-05">5 September</phrase>, for different reasons, I asked the Minister of State in the Cabinet Office, at Cabinet Office questions, for a review of the civil service code. The Minister of State advised that the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General had recently issued the first steps in the civil service reform programme, which sought to enlarge the area of accountability for senior civil servants. Mike Falvey, HMRC&#8217;s chief people officer, provided me with false information about why HMRC proposed to shut the eight nurseries. HMRC has denied that it had knowledge of the clause between Mapeley and Bright Horizons to extend the life of all eight nurseries for a further year, although that denial fits uneasily with the chronological order of events, which would have us believe that Bright Horizons attended a meeting in May 2012, was told that the nurseries would be shut in November 2012, and nobody mentioned the extension clause. I find that difficult to believe.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/4">In any event, the chief executive presided over this debacle until <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-03">3 October</phrase>, when there was a damascene-like change of heart, curiously coinciding with my meeting that day with the Minister. Does the Minister deem the actions of his civil servants to be incompetence or an attempt to mislead a Member or Members of Parliament? If it is incompetence, what is the Minister going to do about it? If it was an attempt to mislead, what is he going to do about it? I represented civil servants of all ranks as a full-time trade union official for most of my working life. Had a junior civil servant shown the same degree of incompetence or provided false information to a senior civil servant, they could have expected the sharp end of a capability or disciplinary process and, more often than not in my experience, that would have led to dismissal. Senior civil servants cannot be insulated or protected from the consequences of their behaviour. People expect their parliamentarians, acting on their behalf, to be given accurate information by Departments when it is requested, especially about decisions that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/5">This debacle was presided over by two of the Minister&#8217;s most senior civil servants, and I have concluded that had it not been for the backing of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents HMRC</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/6">staff, and the campaign in my area led by the families and children to keep their nursery open, and&#8212;I am utterly convinced&#8212;had this Adjournment debate not taken place, given its ability to shed light on the fundamentally flawed process that HMRC has followed, the nurseries thus far reprieved would not have been reprieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/7">It is necessary that all the nurseries involved now be given the same reprieve. I am most grateful, therefore, that the procedures of the House of Commons have come to the rescue, and so too are the 86 families in my constituency. That said, those same 86 families, and countless others, were left in limbo, worried and put under tremendous stress over their children&#8217;s future child care arrangements. That matter cannot be swept under the carpet, so I hope and expect that the Minister will answer the direct questions that I have put to him.</p>

	<p pid="c.135.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40228" name="Michael McCann">the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr McCann)</phrase> on securing this debate and acknowledging his efforts to pursue this issue on behalf of his constituents. I know of the equally determined efforts of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40146" name="Jonathan Evans">the Member for Cardiff North (Jonathan Evans)</phrase> to represent his constituents, and I also acknowledge the other hon. Members who contributed this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/2">As we are all aware, HMRC&#8217;s core purpose is to collect tax and distribute benefits. That is what it was set up to do and where its efforts and resources need to go. Of course, it also has a duty to be a responsible employer to its staff, and I appreciate that the decision to close eight on-site nurseries has been controversial, but this provides an example of the difficult balance that public services often need to strike between their public obligations and their responsibilities to their own staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/3">As alluded to by the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, I am not responsible for the day-to-day management decisions of HMRC, which is a non-ministerial Department, but I am the Minister to whom it is accountable for its core duties, which is why I am responding tonight. For the record, I think that HMRC&#8217;s management decision was broadly the right one, although I agree that its execution of that decision could have been better handled and has caused regrettable upset and uncertainty among the parents of the children in the eight nurseries.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/4">The hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff North and other hon. Members have made several important points, and I will deal with them, but it is important to understand why HMRC made the decision it made. As I understand it, the on-site nurseries were originally set up in a small number of locations where Her Majesty&#8217;s Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue were experiencing recruitment difficulties among younger workers. The nurseries helped them to attract and retain parents of young children, at a time when there was no other provision for child care in HMRC&#8217;s legacy organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/5">Over the years, the number of these nurseries has declined, and across the eight nurseries that we are discussing, which are run by the private nursery provider, Bright Horizons, there has been a decline in both the take-up of places overall and in the proportion of places used by HMRC staff&#8212;I shall return to that point later. In fact, across all eight nurseries, only just over one third of places are currently taken up by HMRC employees. I recognise, however, that this was not the case in East Kilbride and Cardiff, where more than half the spaces were taken up by the children of HMRC staff, as was also the case with the Nottingham site.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/6">HMRC made an operational decision, however, to end and not re-tender the contract for these nurseries, for perfectly understandable reasons. First, in line with Government objectives, HMRC&#8217;s estates strategy is to reduce the size of its footprint and either to hand back unwanted space to its landlord or to make more productive use of the estate that it retains.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.0/1">Will the Minister explain why it is Government policy to waste taxpayers&#8217; money by giving up space that they would then have to continue to pay rent on and leaving custom-built nurseries lying empty when they can be utilised by staff?</p>

	<p pid="c.136.1/1">The hon. Gentleman rightly said that we had a meeting about this matter; indeed, Lin Homer was present for that meeting. He should therefore be aware that Lin Homer repeatedly said that it was possible that the site in East Kilbride could be used for other purposes before 2015.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.3/1">That is what the hon. Gentleman was told repeatedly in that meeting, but if he is accusing me of saying an untruth or saying that Lin Homer did not say that, I would be grateful to hear it.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.4/1">I will be absolutely clear: I have given the Minister evidence that I have been given completely misleading information by civil servants in HMRC that was not true from day one. I am further saying to him that the space in East Kilbride will be empty until 2015. That was confirmed to me in a telephone conversation by the chief executive, Lin Homer, on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-21">21 September</phrase>.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.136.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="136"  time="022:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001269">
	<p pid="c.136.5/1">We are talking about a somewhat hypothetical situation because, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, the site will remain used as a nursery. However, I have to tell him that Lin Homer corrected him on a number of occasions in the meeting we had. She did not say that the site was not going to be used until 2015; what she said was that there were no immediate plans for reuse, although she was not ruling out reuse of the site before 2015, which is a fairly substantial distinction. That is what the hon. Gentleman was told. If he did not understand it, that is regrettable, but that is what he was told repeatedly in that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/2">To continue, in the 18 months to October 2012, HMRC closed 140 buildings and rationalised a further 44. That has resulted in nearly &#163;47 million of savings annually and reduced HMRC&#8217;s estate by around 193,000 square metres&#8212;about 16% of its total estate over that</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/3">period. The spaces left when the nurseries close will be used for HMRC&#8217;s core purpose. Retaining space for on-site nurseries simply does not fit into that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/4">Secondly, given the low nursery occupancy by HMRC staff, the justification for HMRC retaining the eight nurseries is no longer as strong as it was. That is particularly true now that HMRC, like other public sector employers, provides child care vouchers to all eligible staff, which they can use to pay for child care in any nursery they choose. The vouchers cover staff in more than 300 HMRC offices, which is far more than the eight affected by the closure of the nurseries. In making the decision not to re-tender the contract with Bright Horizons, HMRC researched the local areas and was confident that other nurseries had spaces at prices comparable to, and often lower than, those for the places in the Bright Horizons nurseries.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/5">Thirdly, and most importantly in my view, HMRC was providing space to the private sector nursery provider free of both rent and utility bills. I do not believe it is sustainable for a Department, in effect, to provide a direct subsidy to a profitable private company. During these times of austerity, public bodies have a duty to make more productive use of the resources that they are paying for. I believe that HMRC&#8217;s decision was the right and responsible one, but I also think it could have gone about it better.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/6">We have heard the criticism that HMRC did not provide sufficient notice to parents. I agree that more notice would have been preferable, but HMRC was honouring the contract between the estates provider and Bright Horizons, and the contracts between Bright Horizons and the parents, which were for three months&#8217; notice. HMRC, in effect, gave Bright Horizons six months&#8217; warning that the contract would end in November 2012, but Bright Horizons chose not to tell parents earlier than the three months&#8217; notice provided for in their contracts. HMRC could have told its own parents earlier, but it might then have been liable for compensation claims from Bright Horizons.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/7">The hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow has made public statements to the effect that HMRC deliberately gave short notice in order to curtail debate. That allegation is inaccurate and unfair. HMRC was, as hon. Members would expect of a public body, seeking to honour the terms of legal contracts. It is also important to observe that Bright Horizons was given time to seek alternative accommodation for its nurseries, but that it made a commercial decision not to relocate and instead to close these eight nurseries. That was not HMRC&#8217;s decision: it was down to Bright Horizons. However, it is perfectly understandable, bearing in mind that it would have needed to pay market rent for other properties and that the take-up of places was, I understand, declining.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/8">We have heard questions about why HMRC did not extend the contracts for another year or two, or at least extend contracts in the nurseries with high HMRC occupancy. This was a single contract for all eight nurseries, so it was not possible, within the contract, to extend any individual nursery alone. It was a question of all or none. Also, at the time that the decision was taken, HMRC honestly believed that the contract could not be extended. This was not a contract directly with HMRC, but one between Bright Horizons and HMRC&#8217;s landlord, Mapeley. HMRC was not party to all the</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/9">details. In fact, it later transpired that HMRC&#8217;s original belief was incorrect, and that the contract could have been extended by another year for all eight nurseries. But, in any event, at no point did Bright Horizons ask for an extension to the contract, when HMRC opened discussions with it in May 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.5/10">It is highly regrettable that HMRC did not have all the correct information, but that does not alter the reasons for it wanting to end the on-site nursery provision. Nor does it mean, as the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow has alleged, that a senior HMRC official deliberately misled him. I simply do not see any evidence to support that allegation.</p>

	<p pid="c.138.0/1">Time is evaporating fast, and I do not want the Minister to finish without having time to answer my direct questions. However, on the point that he has just made, I was provided with reasons on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-05">5 September</phrase> by Mike Falvey, the chief people officer, yet when I spoke to Lin Homer on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-21">21 September</phrase>, a completely different reason was given. Can the Minister explain that? Will he also answer the two questions that I put to him in my speech?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-10-15c.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="138"  time="022:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121015/debtext/121015-0004.htm#12101538001271">
	<p pid="c.138.1/1">Let me make as much progress as possible. I believe that the letter that the hon. Gentleman received in early September was based on a genuine understanding by HMRC of what the situation was. It related to a contract between Mapeley and Bright Horizons. In his subsequent conversation with the chief executive of HMRC, however, she set out more fully the context and the reasons for making the decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/2">I want to turn to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s suggestion that HMRC cannot reuse the nursery space for any other purpose. That is simply not correct. What HMRC cannot and should not do is commit, long term, to giving part of its estate over to nursery provision when it needs the flexibility to use that estate for its core purpose, and when it cannot do that, to negotiate giving it back to its landlord.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/3">Things have moved on since this Adjournment debate was granted, and I think that HMRC has reached a better outcome. It has shown itself to be responsive to staff concerns and to the representations from the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff North. When staff asked HMRC to consider transitional support, it swiftly put a package of such support in place, including some short-term financial relief for parents facing higher nursery costs and flexible working arrangements to allow parents to search for and settle their children into a new nursery.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/4">HMRC also reopened discussions with Bright Horizons and asked it to consider whether it would enter into a different commercial arrangement at the three nurseries at which HMRC staff accounted for at least half of nursery places, under new contracts. I am pleased that Bright Horizons has agreed to a new and separate temporary lease in East Kilbride and in Cardiff, but it has made it clear that it does not see a commercial case for the third site, in Nottingham. The new lease for East Kilbride and Cardiff will run until August 2015, at which point Bright Horizons would need to relocate the nurseries if it wished to continue. HMRC will not end the lease before that time, although Bright Horizons will be able to close or relocate the nurseries at any point</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/5">before August 2015, provided that it gives HMRC four months&#8217; notice. That is more than the customary three months&#8217; notice.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/6">I know that this arrangement does not cover all the sites affected, but I believe that it is a sensible outcome. It provides a reasonable package of support for parents</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/7">affected at all eight nursery sites, and two and a half years&#8217; more nursery provision at Cardiff and East Kilbride. The long-term outcome is the same&#8212;</p>
