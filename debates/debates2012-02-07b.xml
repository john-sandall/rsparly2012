	<p pid="b.144.5/2">Since May 2010, 117 unelected peers have been appointed to the House of Lords, at an additional cost to the taxpayer of &#163;63 million during the course of this Parliament. We know that a new House of Lords reform Bill will be the centrepiece of the Queen&#8217;s Speech. The Deputy Prime Minister believes that all parliamentarians should be democratically elected and he also believes in cutting public expenditure. Will he therefore confirm that as long as his proposals on Lords reform are in train, there will be no more peers appointed to the House of Lords?</p>

	<p pid="b.144.6/1">No, clearly&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>We have been open in the coalition agreement that, pending wholesale reform of the other place, we will continue to make appointments to the House of Lords in the time-honoured fashion in proportion to the share of the vote won by the parties at the last general election.As with so many issues where the Labour party has become terrifically pious in opposition, this is not something to which the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party adhered to when in government.</p>

	<p pid="b.145.4/1">Last year, when Christopher Kelly&#8217;s committee published a report containing its ideas for a package of reforms of party funding, all parties made clear that it was inconceivable that any of us would advocate an increase in overall state funding at this time. I will therefore stipulate in my letter to the leaders of the other main parties that such an increase is not on the agenda for now. However, that does not mean we could not make progress on many other areas of party funding reform on what I hope would be a cross-party basis.</p>

She will know that some London hospitals, such as the Royal Marsden, have a cap of around 30%, which is not nearly as low as she implies. We are saying that no NHS hospital should be able to earn 50% or more of its income through private practice&#8212;it should be less than half&#8212;and that every penny and every pound raised should be ploughed back into improving services for NHS patients. The alternative is to condemn a number of hospitals into outright financial crisis.

	<p pid="b.158.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service is working with law enforcement agencies and others in the UK, as well as in source countries, to improve the investigation and prosecution of those involved in human trafficking.

	<p pid="b.158.3/1">To what extent are prosecutors and police alert to the fact that British citizens are being trafficked both within the UK, as was uncovered shockingly in my constituency last September, and from the UK, as we learned earlier this month?</p>

	<p pid="b.158.4/1">We are very much aware that this is a problem, but part of the difficulty is that trafficking for forced labour is notoriously difficult to establish, and often the victims will not come forward. That said, as my hon. Friend will be aware, there is now a national referral mechanism that alerts the police at neighbourhood level, the UK Border Agency, social services and charitable organisations as to how they can pick up such information and feed it into the specialist units of the police, which can then bring in the Crown Prosecution Service to try to deal with those matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.158.5/1">If the Government are serious about more prosecutions and, indeed, about preventing trafficking, should we not substantially increase the UK Border Agency&#8217;s strength, with many more properly based staff so that they can do the job?</p>

	<p pid="b.158.6/1">As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, with my hat on as superintendent of the Crown Prosecution Service, it would be easy for me to ask for extra resources in all directions outside my own Department, but if he thinks that there are specific instances in which the service may be in some way deficient he should, I suggest, bring them to my attention or to that of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. The evidence that I have from the Crown Prosecution Service is that it receives very good co-operation from the agencies with which it deals.</p>

	<p pid="b.158.8/1">I am not in a position to give my hon. Friend a precise date. What I suggest I do, as he will appreciate that the issue is outside my departmental area, is to write to him when I have ascertained whether we have further detailed information on it.</p>

	<p pid="b.158.9/2">police in this country and elsewhere. Given that many such gangs are elsewhere in the European Union, is not the European arrest warrant a vital part of the necessary armoury?

	<p pid="b.159.0/1">I have no doubt at all that mechanisms for co-operation throughout the European Union and, indeed, elsewhere can be very useful in the apprehension of criminals, particularly in this field. How that should best be carried out is, if I may say so to the hon. Gentleman, ultimately, I suppose, going to be a matter for this House, if it ever comes up for review.</p>

	<p pid="b.160.5/1">Yes, there is no doubt about that. The Court itself knows that. Some efforts have been made to reduce the backlog, particularly by streamlining the sitting hours of completely hopeless applications. The problem remains that there is a large number of cases that is in excess of the number of cases that can be heard each year. It is for those reasons that the United Kingdom, as part of its reform package, has asked those who are interested to examine how principles of subsidiarity can be introduced so that fewer cases have to be considered by the Court, with cases instead being resolved properly at national level wherever possible.</p>

Although we need to ensure that the Court keeps its autonomy, there is widespread acknowledgment that there must be reform if it is to continue doing its work properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.165.2/1">Since December 2001, successive British Governments have sought to deport Abu Qatada to Jordan, his home country, because he poses a serious risk to our national security. Qatada has a long-standing association with al-Qaeda. British courts have found:</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/2">&#8220;His reach and the depth of his influence&#8230;is formidable&#8230;He provides a religious justification for&#8230;acts of violence and terror&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/3">In Jordan, he has been tried and found guilty in absentia of terrorism offences including conspiracy to cause explosions at western and Israeli targets and involvement in the bombings of the American school and the Jerusalem hotel in Amman in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/4">The House of Lords agreed with the Government that Qatada can be deported to Jordan to face a retrial because of the diplomatic assurances negotiated by Britain and the Jordanian Government. That agreement ensures that individuals deported to Jordan will not be tortured upon their return. Despite the House of Lords agreement that Qatada should be deported, and despite accepting that he would not face mistreatment in Jordan, the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month against his deportation. It did so on the grounds that deportation would violate article 6 of the convention, the right to a fair trial, due to the risk that evidence obtained from the torture of others would be used against him. Hon. Members should be aware that that argument had already been considered by a British court and rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/5">I hardly need tell the House that the Government disagree vehemently with Strasbourg&#8217;s ruling. We believe that Abu Qatada should be deported. We are considering all the legal options available, including whether to refer the case to the Grand Chamber. As we do so, we will continue to negotiate with the Jordanians to see what assurances they can give us about the evidence used against Qatada in their courts. Following the Strasbourg ruling, Qatada&#8217;s lawyers appealed to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission for bail. We opposed that appeal vigorously, but yesterday it was granted, and bail will start within a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/6">The bail conditions are among the most stringent imposed on anybody facing deportation from the UK, and reflect the conditions set out when Qatada was bailed in 2008. He will be under a 22-hour curfew. He will not be allowed to access the internet or any electronic communication devices. He will not be allowed to travel outside an approved boundary. Visitors will need to be approved, under very strict conditions. He will be subject to a specific condition preventing him from attending mosques and leading group prayer. If any of those conditions are breached, he will be re-arrested and we will seek his immediate re-detention. But however strict the bail conditions, I continue to believe that Qatada should remain behind bars.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/7">It is simply not acceptable that after the Jordanians have guaranteed his treatment, after British courts have found that he is dangerous and after his removal has</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/8">been approved by the highest courts in our land, we still cannot deport such a dangerous foreign national. We continue to consider the case for a British Bill of Rights, and the Prime Minister is leading the Government&#8217;s attempts to reform the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.2/9">The right place for a terrorist is a prison cell. The right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell, far away from Britain. That is why we will do everything that we can within the existing legal regime to deport Qatada, and we are doing everything that we can to reform that regime to avoid such cases in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.166.0/1">I am grateful to the Home Secretary for her answer. She will understand, of course, that there is considerable concern throughout the House about yesterday&#8217;s decision. I appreciate, as do we all, that it places her in a difficult situation, but the public will want reassurance that the Government are doing everything possible to protect their safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.0/2">First, can she offer any explanation why Mr Justice Mitting decided to bail Abu Qatada now, while an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights is still possible, rather than give notice that that would happen at some point in future if Ministers were ultimately unable to deport him? Will she say more about the discussions with the authorities in Jordan? Does she expect to receive assurances on the use of evidence, and if so, when? Given the urgency of the situation, will Ministers be directly involved in those discussions? Does she intend to make further representations to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission? Has Mr Justice Mitting indicated that he would be prepared to reconsider the three-month deadline for removing bail conditions if the Government received the necessary assurances and appealed against the ECHR ruling?</p>
	<p pid="b.166.0/3">The public will be reassured by the fact that Home Office lawyers were successful in pressing SIAC to impose a 22-hour curfew on Abu Qatada. What arguments were advanced for that level of control, and how do they compare with the much-reduced arrangements that would be available if Abu Qatada were made subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure? Will the Home Secretary confirm that, under a TPIM, Abu Qatada would be entitled to a mobile phone and have access to the internet, that an overnight residence requirement would not exceed 16 hours, and that she would be unable to relocate him to another part of the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.166.0/4">What additional costs will fall to the police and the Security Service as a result of the decision to grant Abu Qatada bail? Will the Home Secretary update the House on progress made since the Prime Minister&#8217;s recent speech in Strasbourg on the need to reshape the relationship between the ECHR and the UK&#8217;s own judicial system? Does she agree that it should only be in truly exceptional cases that a Supreme Court judgment can be challenged in the ECHR? Finally, does she agree that it is a good thing that indefinite detention without trial was ruled to be unlawful, but that the answer in Abu Qatada&#8217;s case is deportation, with assurances, to Jordan, not release into the community in Britain?</p>

	<p pid="b.166.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman has raised several issues in his supplementary questions, some of which relate to the approach that Justice Mitting might take</p>
	<p pid="b.166.1/2">in certain circumstances, but obviously it is not for me to indicate what approach the judge would take. However, were assurances received from the Jordanian Government&#8212;we are working hard on that&#8212;obviously that would change the scenario and, by introducing a new factor, would enable the Government to take action that would, I think, change SIAC&#8217;s approach. If any case were to go before it again, though, it would be for it to determine.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.1/3">The right hon. Gentleman referred to the work being done on the ECHR. As he will be aware, because of our chairmanship of the Council of Europe, we are in a position for six months to take action on this matter, and we are working actively with other countries with a similar interest in ensuring that the European Court acts as originally intended, which is as a Court considering the most serious issues and key points of human rights law, rather than as a body to which people automatically appeal once they have gone through national courts. That work is being actively led by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Justice. Furthermore, as I mentioned, the Prime Minister has been to Strasbourg, spoken on these matters and explained our position.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.1/4">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned TPIMs and bail, but of course they are two separate matters&#8212;one should not conflate the two. The Home Office made vigorous representations to SIAC arguing that Abu Qatada should not be released on bail, but that were it to happen, the most stringent conditions should be applied. As I said, these are among the most stringent conditions applied to anybody we are currently unable to deport from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.166.1/5">As the right hon. Gentleman said at the end, it is absolutely right that in this country we do not have indefinite detention without trial. However, everyone on both sides of the House wants to ensure that we can deport those who represent a danger to the United Kingdom and whom we believe should be deported. That is why we are considering our options within the legal process, and why we are negotiating with Jordanians on further assurances in order to deport Abu Qatada. However, it is also why we are working to make the changes in the European Court to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, and looking at the whole issue of assurances with other countries, to ensure that we strengthen our ability to deport people who are a danger to us.</p>

	<p pid="b.167.1/1">I have been used, over time in my political life, to words that I have said being taken slightly out of context.

	<p pid="b.168.0/1">The Home Secretary has given a serious account of the risk from Abu Qatada. She will know that we agree that he should be deported, on the grounds of being a risk to national security. However, she has not said much about what she is doing now in response to the judgment. She is right to look at the legal options for appealing against the European Court judgment, but what more is she doing to get further assurances from Jordan so that he can be deported now? She will know that an agreement was reached by the British Government before the election, so it is possible to make diplomatic progress. We understand that the British ambassador has been in some discussions, but what actions have Ministers taken? Has the Home Secretary taken this up herself with the Jordanian Government? If she has not done so, will she do so now? If so, will she go back to SIAC to ask for a stay of the bail until those high-level discussions with the Jordanian Government have been completed, given the urgency and seriousness of this case?</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/2">On the second issue&#8212;protecting public safety in the meantime&#8212;it is unclear whether the Home Secretary is looking for more evidence to take to SIAC to overturn the bail decision. However, what will happen if the negotiations with Jordan fail and if the courts conclude that bail cannot be extended in three months&#8217; time? Those are the circumstances that control orders were introduced to address, but her decision has been to weaken those counter-terror laws, and that will make it harder. Under the current system, if TPIMs have to be introduced after three months if bail is stopped, she will not be able to ask the courts for a curfew&#8212;only an overnight residence requirement&#8212;and she will have to provide access to the internet and telephones. She will not be able to ask the courts to relocate Abu Qatada outside London, should that be appropriate&#8212;during the Olympics, for example&#8212;nor will she be able to extend those restrictions for more than two years. The restrictions that the Home Secretary will have available to her in three months&#8217; time are a far cry from the restrictions that she and the courts understandably believe are necessary now to protect the public, which include the 22-hour curfew, no access to the internet and no access to phones.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/3">The Home Secretary cannot blame the European Court for her decision to weaken British counter-terror powers. The courts, the security experts and the Home Secretary have all made it clear that Abu Qatada is a continued threat to public safety and national security. We support her in her actions to protect the public and get the deportation in place, but she should be straining every sinew, on behalf of the public, to get him deported. If she cannot, she should make sure that we have the legislation and the safeguards in place to protect the public now.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.1/1">I have to say to the shadow Home Secretary that she appears to have prepared her statement before listening to my answer, because I made it clear that I continue to believe that Qatada should face trial in Jordan and that the Government have begun discussions with the Jordanians to see what assurances we can</p>
	<p pid="b.168.1/2">secure about the quality of evidence used in their courts. We will be pursuing those discussions at every level that is appropriate to ensure that we work towards the aim that we share across the House: getting the assurances that will enable us to deport Abu Qatada. As I said, we will also consider the legal options that are available, including whether we should refer the case to the Grand Chamber, but we need to consider the consequences of those actions before we take a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.1/3">I referred, obviously, to the bail conditions that have been placed on Qatada, as the right hon. Lady did. I continue to believe that he should be behind bars. The bail conditions are among the most stringent on anybody facing deportation from Britain. She referred to the difference between TPIMs and control orders. I remind her that the bail conditions are stronger than would be possible under TPIMs or control orders. I also refer her to the wider point that I have made about TPIMs in the Chamber in the past, which is that the police and the Security Service are content with the package that was negotiated in relation to TPIMs and with the extra funding that has been made available to the Security Service and the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.1/4">We should be able to deport Abu Qatada; that is the view across the whole House. He should be behind bars. Home Office Ministers and previous Home Secretaries under the previous Government have tried to do everything possible to get him to Jordan, and that is what this Government are trying to do. The case has been ongoing since 2001. In 2008, there was a brief period during which he was released on bail. We should send a clear message from across the House that we believe he should be deported, and this Government are doing what we can to ensure that we achieve that. That is what is right for the security of our citizens.</p>

	<p pid="b.169.1/1">The specific reason for the European Court finding against deportation was the question of whether the evidence that would be used against Abu Qatada in his retrial&#8212;he had been tried in absentia&#8212;had been obtained as a result of torture. That is the issue that was raised by the European Court, and that is the issue that we are addressing.</p>

	<p pid="b.169.2/1">In 2002, when Abu Qatada was eventually apprehended, he was in a flat about 400 yards away from MI5 headquarters, using what was then the most sophisticated electronic equipment to communicate his message. Given that the Home Secretary has said time and again this afternoon that the bail conditions are tough and would restrict him from being able to do that again, how can she possibly justify allowing a situation to arise at the end of April, with the Olympic games and the Queen&#8217;s jubilee taking place, in which terrorism prevention and investigation measures would come into effect that would do away with all the restrictions that she has set out in the bail conditions?</p>

	<p pid="b.170.2/1">I do not believe that millions of people are losing confidence in our legal system. I believe that they are concerned about the ability of the European Court to come to decisions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of the United Kingdom. This decision on Abu Qatada is clearly a case in point. That is why it is important for the Government to pursue the work that we are doing, not only in looking into the possibility of a British Bill of Rights but in trying to make changes to the way in which the European Court operates, so that in future we will be able to deport people who present a danger to us.</p>

Many of us, myself included, personally sought to negotiate with the Jordanians&#8212;unsuccessfully&#8212;to achieve that. If that cannot happen, however, and if the bail conditions lapse at the end of three months, will she accept that, on any analysis, the powers that she has put on to the statute book&#8212;these so-called TPIMs&#8212;are much weaker than the powers of the control orders that were in place and that worked satisfactorily in the past?</p>

The bail conditions might well be relaxed, so the only choice she will have under current legislation would be to impose a TPIM. Time and again, we have seen that TPIMs do not have the measures necessary to give the British people the degree of security that they need.

In that sense, the memorandum of understanding was found to be workable by the Strasbourg court; access to a fair trial was the issue that it raised, but we will continue to be in negotiations with a number of countries where we feel it would be helpful to have such memorandums of understanding in place.</p>

If I may say so, I think it possible that those who have been in the Home Office are often more acutely sensitive than others to the fact that the balance sometimes goes in a direction that we do not feel gives sufficient weight to issues of national security. However, as we try to bring 46 other countries along with us in our attempt to introduce some reform to the European Court, we shall need to examine exactly what sort of cases should be going there.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.1/1">I have noted my hon. Friend&#8217;s suggestion that he could come forward with a sum of money of the sort he has described. It is right that the Government look at operating within the legal framework open to us and that we look at the legal options available, which include whether we should refer to the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court. Also, on the other side, it is right that we continue the negotiations with the Jordanians. His constituents, mine and others across the country wish to see Abu Qatada deported and the Government will do what they can to see whether we can get to a position where that is possible.</p>

Article 16 makes it clear that Governments can restrict the political activity of foreign nationals in self-defence, and the Jordanian hate-preacher Abu Qatada is a clear case of that.

	<p pid="b.177.3/1">I agree with my hon. Friend that the way in which the European Court operates is not how it was originally intended to operate.

	<p pid="b.178.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Gambling Act 2005 to regulate remote gambling on a point of consumption basis; to require all operators selling into the British market, whether in the United Kingdom or overseas, to hold a Gambling Commission licence to enable them to undertake transactions with British consumers and to advertise in the United Kingdom; to provide that all relevant operators contribute to the Horserace Betting Levy; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/3">I am proud to stand in the House to represent the global headquarters of horse racing. For centuries, Newmarket has been at the heart of that great sport. From the time when the merry monarch moved his court twice a year to gamble on the races to modern times when the jobs of 5,000 of my constituents are linked to racing, the story of Newmarket has been, and remains, interwoven with the story of race horses.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/4">I declare an interest. I am widely supported by the racing industry, including as declared in my entry in the register, and I am an unwavering supporter of racing.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/5">As the presence of so many Members in the Chamber shows, the issue is not just about Newmarket. Attendance at horse racing is second only to football. British racing is among the best in the world; our blood stock is the best in the world. More than 6 million people, from every walk of life, visit British race courses every year; &#163;10 billion is placed in bets, &#163;300 million is paid in taxes and 100,000 people are employed by the racing industry nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/6">This great sport is under threat. Racing has suffered a devastating fall in funding. The horse-racing levy&#8212;the annual payment from betting to racing in return for the product on which so many bets are placed&#8212;has declined from more than &#163;100 million in 2009 to less than &#163;60 million last year. Prize money, the lifeblood of the sport, has fallen by half in two years. Even second place will no longer cover the cost of diesel to many of our smaller fixtures. The number of mares in foal is declining and more of our best stock is sent overseas for training, especially to France.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/7">Race courses, trainers, jockeys and staff are struggling, and livelihoods are under threat, but with attendances at courses at record levels, why is there that decline? It is because since 2007, 18 of our 20 biggest bookmakers have moved offshore, so according to bookmakers&#8217; own estimates they avoid &#163;300 million in tax and tens of millions in contribution to the levy. As punters increasingly go online, that avoidance is set to grow. Offshore bookmakers also fall outside UK consumer protection rules and stifle competition from those who remain onshore. Smaller independent bookies lose out, as do responsible bookmakers who remain onshore, such as Bet365 and Coral. In their correspondence with me, independents despair that there is no level playing field. Why should they pay the tax and full levy when the big boys do not?</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/8">Offshore bookmakers tell me that they are only offshore because their competitors are, so I shall take them at their word. Let us have a level playing field, efficiently enforced right here in the UK. How should it be done? What is the proposed solution?</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/9">There is now broad consensus in the House and outside that the levy system is broken. It has failed to keep up with the times and it should be replaced with a commercially sensitive alternative, such as a racing right. Instead of the antagonism generated by the levy system, gambling and racing can work together to their mutual benefit. As Paul Bittar, the impressive new chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority has set out, the new system must be sustainable, able to adapt to ever-changing technology and to the rapid channel shift towards online and smartphone betting. Of course, those wider reforms must also encompass betting exchanges. After all, a bet is a bet whether one side is a company or another punter.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/10">The basis of any commercial arrangement must be a level playing field for bookmakers&#8212;onshore paying tax. That is what the simple change in the Bill would bring about. It would not solve all the problems of the world, but it would have a big effect. It would define the location of the bet as not where the bookie is but where the punter is. Technically, gambling licences would be provided on the basis of point of consumption, not point of sale. A bookmaker who wants to market to British punters and take bets from them must be licensed by the Gambling Commission. Tax and levy would be paid. It is a simple change with a big effect. There are two concerns that I want to tackle head-on. First, some say that bringing bookies onshore would drive punters to unlicensed sites. Hold on: most sites are already offshore, outside full regulation. That, indeed, is part of the problem, so the Bill would bring the vast majority of bookmakers back onshore. Offshore bookmakers could not advertise and would face prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/11">I am a practical man. Let us not make the best the enemy of the good. Just because we cannot do everything does not mean that we should do nothing. Indeed, the argument about leakage shows just how important it is that the onshore rule is enforced properly. I say, yes, there is concern about leakage: let us ban offshore gambling effectively. Others make the objection that the 15% tax rate is too high, and should be cut&#8212;we should use the carrot, not the stick&#8212;and I think there is merit in that argument. I am in favour of lower taxes, and no tax should be punitive. I say, yes, there is a tax rate that is fair to racing, bookmakers and the Treasury. It is not zero, and the Bill should be the first step in finding it.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.2/12">British horse racing has a proud history, and a broad and passionate following. For generations, it has been the best in the world, attracting talent from around the world, and it is the envy of the world. At this moment&#8212;the moment of Frankel, Kauto Star and Her Majesty&#8217;s own Carlton House&#8212;when the glittering sport of racing is at its best, we should look to the future with optimism and hope, yet optimism there is not, because the sport&#8217;s financial currents are on a rip tide. However, there is hope. It begins with this Bill. The support of the House would give this finest of sports, the sport that we love, hope to compete in the world, hope that jobs can be saved and our heritage enhanced, and hope for a bright future. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.180.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="180"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0001.htm#12020774000755">
	<p pid="b.180.0/1">I should begin by declaring an interest as a racehorse owner and breeder. Despite that, I oppose the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40652" name="Matthew Hancock">the Member for West Suffolk (Matthew Hancock)</phrase>. I do not quibble with his argument on a point-of-consumption tax on principle. My objection is that it addresses the wrong issue. In practice, the matter is far more complex and the measure is doomed to fail if it does not address the issue of tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/2">As my hon. Friend knows full well as a Government insider, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Treasury are already looking at the key issues. In July last year, the Government announced a proposal to regulate the remote gambling industry on a point-of-consumption basis to enhance the protection and regulation offered to UK online customers. Following that proposal, the Treasury announced its intention to review the taxation regime for remote gambling to bring it into line with the basis of regulation for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/3">My hon. Friend is clearly a champion of the racing industry, so I am surprised by his unquestioning enthusiasm for the measure. He said that the levy had declined, which it has, but he failed to mention that bookmakers are paying more and more every year in picture rights. The combined amount of the levy and picture rights means that bookmakers are paying more than ever for their racing product, despite its being less and less of the bets that they take. A funding deal is being negotiated, and if betting firms have to pay more than they can afford, there will be a decline in their operating profits and in what they can pay to racing.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/4">The idea that the Bill would enhance UK consumer protection is absolute nonsense. The British market is one of the most highly regulated markets in the world, and therefore one of the most protected. If we look at the white list&#8212;my hon. Friend said that businesses offshore were unregulated; they are not, as they all have to be on that list&#8212;the whole point is to ensure that the UK accepts only countries that have similarly rigorous levels of protection. If I accepted his insistence that this was a matter of regulation rather than taxation, I would regard the Bill as a solution looking for a problem, but I can tell him that it would reduce consumer protection if enacted.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/5">A Deloitte report, &#8220;The impact of a point of consumption tax on the remote gambling industry&#8221;, published in December 2011, concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/6">&#8220;given the low returns that a significant proportion of the smaller operators currently earn, even relatively low levels of POC tax could force some of the smaller firms to exit the online gambling market.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/7">Therefore, a 15% point-of-consumption tax would increase the risk to punters in an otherwise well regulated and safe market, as bookmakers would be forced to exit the UK market and less compliant operators remaining outside the tax net would still target UK customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/8">The Deloitte report cautions against any point-of-consumption tax, which is interesting in itself, but clearly states that a 5% tax</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/9">&#8220;would distort competition, leading to as much as 13% of UK online gambling&#8230; moving into the grey market.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/10">A 10% rate of tax would see 27% of gambling move into the grey market, and a 15% rate would see 40% of punters seek a competitive offering in the black and</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/11">grey markets, thereby defeating the Government&#8217;s stated policy objective of increasing customer protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/12">Regulating markets in the way my hon. Friend proposes is proving extremely difficult for Governments around the world. Some have tried internet blocking and some have focused on banning financial transactions to illegal sites, but they have all been spectacularly unsuccessful; that applies not only to the gambling sector, but to other sectors. Since the Italian market was subjected to a high-level tax regime, illegal gambling in Italy is now believed to be worth between &#8364;12 billion and &#8364;20 billion a year in turnover.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/13">The US internet gambling market amounted to around $6.4 billion in 2010, including sports betting, horseracing, casinos, poker and bingo. Only around 4% of that was on horserace betting, which is licensed in the US, and the remaining 96% derived from licensed betting companies based outside the US, for example in Costa Rica. Such gambling is regarded by the US authorities as illegal, but measures to prevent it have clearly not been wholly successful. Norway&#8217;s gambling watchdog has admitted that its online payments ban has &#8220;not been a success&#8221;, as research showed that more than half of internet gamblers now play as often as they did before the prohibition, but on unregulated sites abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/14">The Government are always vocal about formulating policy based on evidence. If they are serious about that, they should practise what they preach. The Deloitte report concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/15">&#8220;International evidence from jurisdictions such as the US, France and Italy indicates that many of the regulations introduced in these markets have failed to prevent the emergence of a large unregulated sector. These examples highlight the potential for customers to switch between licensed and unlicensed sectors, and point towards some of the challenges that are involved in introducing effective measures to prevent this occurrence&#8230; enforcement is challenging, with no existing system proven to be entirely effective and some jurisdictions losing significant shares of the market to the unlicensed sector.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/16">Without proper enforcement to protect the market, the reality is that only those based in the UK will be caught by the tax. We would therefore be in a perverse situation in which those operators that take out British licences and become subject to our taxation would be at a significant competitive disadvantage and their businesses would suffer accordingly. We would also create an unregulated monster abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/17">The motivation behind the Bill seems to be to raise revenue. As a result, it could even be rendered illegal under EU law. That could prove a hugely costly battle, and one that I am not entirely sure the Government could be confident of winning. My guess is that that is</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/18">why they want to focus on consumer protection and regulation in an attempt to get around this particularly sticky wicket, but I am afraid that it is doomed to failure. If the POC rate were in single figures, many betting companies would accept it, but the higher the rate, the higher the likelihood of legal challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/19">Interestingly, Denmark has introduced a lower rate of tax for online gambling than for offline gambling, so that is an option now open to the UK Government. However, unfortunately there seems to be little evidence that they are reviewing such a policy. I was greatly encouraged by my hon. Friend&#8217;s view that the tax should be as low as possible, because getting 5% of something is a lot better than getting 15% of nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/20">Please do not take my word for that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Deloitte report concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/21">&#8220;a cautious approach to the introduction of a POC tax appears to be appropriate. Setting an initial tax rate below 10% would be consistent with minimising the risk of promoting a grey market&#8221;<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/22">My hon. Friend seems to dismiss the Deloitte report, but he should bear it in mind that the Treasury Minister concerned used to work for Deloitte, so she might have more faith in its work than he does.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/23">We need to focus on why some betting companies are based abroad. The reason why is the level of taxation, and the level of taxation alone, so the Bill is a blunt instrument that does not address the need for a competitive rate of gross profits tax or allow businesses to reclaim their VAT in the UK. That would be a far more sensible point from which to start the debate, and one which many in the industry would be more willing to accept.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.0/24">I fully appreciate where my hon. Friend is coming from, and I do not object to his proposal on principle, but I urge him to concentrate on the benefits of a single-figure rate of point-of-consumption tax, to weigh up the possibilities of a legal challenge from a powerful consortium and, most important of all, to address the elephants in the room&#8212;the high rate of VAT and the high rate of tax&#8212;and ensure that they are part of the solution, because if they are not, my hon. Friend&#8217;s proposal, which is genuinely intended, will be doomed to fail.</p>

	<p pid="b.183.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern that the recent Bank of England publication, Trends in Lending, shows that net lending to businesses has fallen in nine out of the last 12 months and by more than &#163;10 billion in the last year; further notes that a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills report published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-02">2 February 2012</phrase> states that the stock of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises peaked in 2009 and in November 2011 declined by 6.1 per cent. compared to November 2010, whilst banks were frequently setting bonuses for their senior executives which were too large; believes that bank executive remuneration should be related to performance and that banks either directly or indirectly supported by the taxpayer must recognise that the taxpayer expects very large bonuses only to be paid to reflect genuine exceptional performance; notes with concern that the Government has not given due consideration to repeating the bankers&#8217; bonus tax, in addition to the bank levy, to pay for 100,000 jobs for young people; calls on the Government to increase transparency, accountability and responsibility in the setting of pay in the banking sector, including through the immediate implementation of the Walker Review on corporate governance, and the placing of an employee representative on the remuneration committees of company boards; and further calls on the Government to reform the banking sector so that it better supports businesses and provides the credit they need to create jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/3">I should like to take this opportunity to tell the House that I have been informed that the Business Secretary is not able to be here today because he is at a funeral. I am sure that the whole House will want to join me in wishing him well on this sad day.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/4">The subject of the motion, responsibility and reform in the banking sector and in the wider economy, has been a matter of immense public interest of late and is one on which many Members have already spoken out. Let us be clear&#8212;I think I speak for most Members when I say this&#8212;that in speaking out on these issues hon. Members simply reflect the strong views expressed by our constituents on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/5">The Labour party&#8217;s starting point is this: we are proud of our financial services centre, the City of London being arguably the world&#8217;s leading financial services centre. I, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase>, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who will make the Opposition&#8217;s winding-up speech, and many other Members are, I know, proud to have spent time working in the City of London before being elected to this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/6">The City helps to give the country a competitive edge, thanks to the talent that we have here, our time zone, our company law, our jurisdiction and the free flow of capital in London. The financial services sector as a whole employs more than 1 million people nationally and makes up 10% of our total national income, but no witness to recent history could claim with credibility that the sector has functioned as British businesses, our economy and our society as a whole would have wanted over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/7">Ultimately, the fault for that lies with a minority of those working in the sector, but as the party in government through much of that period we, along with others in</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/8">power throughout the world, must, and we do, accept with humility that we should have better regulated the sector, because dysfunction in the banking sector here and globally led to the financial crisis of 2008-09, to the recession that followed and to its aftermath. That recession, the gestation of which is found in the banking sector, is something for which the British people are still paying.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.0/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that the current structures were set up following the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International 20 years ago. There remain within the Treasury the confidential parts of the Bingham report. Does he think that it is time that those confidential parts were published? That would give us a better understanding of exactly what went wrong in the biggest collapse of a bank in British history.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.1/1">I agree with my right hon. Friend. I know that that is something for which he has campaigned for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/2">We all know the facts. From the middle of 2007, the losses sustained on securities backed by sub-prime mortgage assets led to a credit crunch. That credit crunch came about due to a loss of counterparty confidence and uncertainty about which financial institutions held toxic assets. Depressed asset prices and increased losses led to serious solvency issues in major banks here and in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/3">In the US, Bear Stearns had to be rescued by J. P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and AIG was nationalised in 2008 by that well known socialist, the 43rd President of the United States, George Bush. Here, Northern Rock had already been nationalised by the Labour Government by 2008. Later that year, we put in place a &#163;500 billion package of measures designed to recapitalise the banks. That included the special liquidity scheme and inter-bank lending guarantees. The Labour Government took stakes in two of our biggest banks so that, by the end of 2009, the Government held a stake in Lloyds of just over 40% and a stake in RBS that increased to more than 80%.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/4">For all the criticism that is often heaped on my right hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling) and for Kircaldidy&#8212;sorry, for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)&#8212;by Government Members, I believe that we owe a debt of gratitude to them both for the decisive action that they took to save the system from itself, to secure people&#8217;s savings and to ensure that the people we represent could continue to withdraw money from cash machines in the wall. The Opposition are proud of what they achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/5">As the Independent Commission on Banking stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/6">&#8220;without the intervention of national authorities around the world&#8212;requiring taxpayers to incur significant direct costs and larger contingent liabilities&#8212;the consequences of the crisis would have been immeasurably worse.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/7">It is for that reason that this House has every right to take an interest in remuneration and reform in the banking sector. After all, our banks still benefit from an implicit taxpayer subsidy if they fail.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.0/1">I do not believe that that is what the report on RBS said. I did concede earlier that the Opposition accept that, in office, we should have better regulated the sector. I also think that Government Members who urged us towards a light-touch regulatory regime should accept that they, too, were mistaken.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree with me and some of my constituents who have been in touch that the one thing that is lacking in the current crisis is leadership? That was not the case a few years ago when my right hon.

	<p pid="b.185.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend and thank him for correcting my pronunciation of the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/2">It is worth taking our minds back to the months leading up to April 2009, when the former Prime Minister went around the world galvanising support and encouraging people to attend the summit. It is worth noting that President Obama of the United States was not planning to attend the G20 conference in London, but in the end many people came here and the conference achieved great things and helped to secure the system. That was, indeed, leadership.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.3/1">The hon.

Does he think the previous Prime Minister showed good leadership by recommending Fred Goodwin for a knighthood and giving him a &#163;700,000 pension?</p>

	<p pid="b.185.4/1">We have said that, if we had known then what we know now, we would not have knighted Fred Goodwin. However, I say to the hon. Gentleman that the future of the banking sector is bigger than the individuals who have featured in the headlines of late. It is important that we debate what happens in the sector as a whole rather than focusing on Fred Goodwin and other individuals, important though it is to make points about them.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.5/1">As we are examining history&#8212;some Government Members do not like to hear accurate history&#8212;I point out that Lord Burns was the Chairman and I was the deputy Chairman of the pre-legislative Joint Committee that considered the financial services Act. I remember that very clearly indeed, because it took us many months and was the first time there had been a joint Lords-Commons pre-legislative inquiry. The context was bitter resentment from the banks, which tried to water down the Bill, and no help from the people who led the Conservative party.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.6/1">I presume that my hon. Friend is referring to the Joint Committee that considered the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The consensus at the time was shown in the approach instilled in the Act, and we are now revisiting the regulation of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.6/2">The crash was global in nature, and the causes cited by the Independent Commission on Banking include declining underwriting standards, the mispricing of risk, a vast expansion of banks&#8217; balance sheets and rapid growth in securitised assets&#8212;in short, gross irresponsibility. The commission also stated in its report that one problem was that some bank employees were remunerated</p>
	<p pid="b.185.6/3">&#8220;on the basis of reported profits that were neither time-adjusted nor risk-adjusted, and led to employee incentives that were not always aligned with the long-term interests of the bank.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.185.6/4">The US financial crisis inquiry commission established by President Obama, which reported last year, went further, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.185.6/5">&#8220;Compensation systems&#8212;designed in an environment of cheap money, intense competition, and light regulation&#8212;too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term gain&#8212;without proper consideration of long-term consequences. Often, those systems encouraged the big bet&#8212;where the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside limited.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.186.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that we should not demonise one group in society, whether they be bankers or benefit claimants? This is about fairness. We know from recent evidence that fairer societies are better for everybody, improving life expectancy and increasing social mobility. We should use that evidence to inform policy that is principally about fairness.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.2/1">The Conservatives always tried to rewrite history when they were in opposition, but the truth is coming out now. Even Polly Toynbee, who was the biggest critic of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, has now forgiven him and wishes he were back.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/2">More importantly, if the man or woman in the street who goes to work every day fails in their job, they get the sack. No one but a banker would ever be rewarded for failure, but we now have a culture in this country of rewarding failure. Surely that must be wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.5/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman brought up that point, because I anticipated it. First, I think it is good that Members of this House have experience in working for business. Secondly, my experience of advising different companies and financial institutions on such arrangements has convinced me that we must reform the way in which the system works&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I would also say to Ministers, who are crowing, that they might wish to reflect on the fact that my ultimate boss at the time when I was more deeply involved in drafting such arrangements was the senior partner of Herbert Smith, whom the Prime Minister ennobled in</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/2">the first tranche of peers at the beginning of this Parliament&#8212;no doubt because of his services to the legal profession and the City of London.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/3">As the Leader of the Opposition said last week, we are still dealing with the aftermath of the moment to which I have referred and the recession it caused. Many thousands of people lost their jobs and now face the biggest squeeze on their living standards in a generation. Thousands of robust, profitable businesses have struggled to access finance or have gone under. At this juncture, I want to tackle head on the accusation that to raise those issues and criticise the financial services sector is to be anti-business&#8212;some have even referred to it as indiscriminate business bashing. That is an utterly absurd notion given that among the most vociferous critics of our banks are the small and medium-sized businesses that make up the overwhelming majority of businesses in this country. The people making those outlandish claims of anti-business sentiment talk as though large financial institutions are the only businesses in this country. Yes, those institutions are an important part of our business community, but there is so much more to British business than big finance. Indeed, we need to rebalance our economy not to diminish our competitive edge in financial services but to grow other sectors so that we are not so reliant on that one sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/4">Businesses in other sectors are struggling right now. The most recent Bank of England trends in lending show that net lending to businesses has fallen in nine out of the past 12 months and lending has fallen by more than &#163;10 billion in the past year. A report published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills last week states that the stock of lending to small and medium-sized businesses declined by 6.1% in November 2011 compared with a year earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/5">It is not just that the banks are failing to get the money out of the door to successful, profitable businesses with robust business models. There has been a move away from relationship banking, where banks saw it as their duty to get to know and understand their business customers properly. Yesterday, I met a number of successful export businesses in the home counties&#8212;businesses that help us pay our way in the world. I was told by the overwhelming majority that when it came to getting help from their banks to export and expand, their banks simply did not want to know.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/6">Some have suggested that that is all the result of increased capital requirements on the banks, but Robert Jenkins, a member of the Bank of England&#8217;s interim Financial Policy Committee, told the Treasury Committee last month:</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/7">&#8220;Making the banks safer through greater resilience in their balance sheets and more capital does not, in and of itself, prevent additional lending.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/8">Despite all that, people and businesses have had to watch as billions in bonuses have been paid to bankers since 2008-09. It is worth stating that we are not talking about the sums earned by the average bank employee&#8212;the cashier, say, in a local branch&#8212;but about the enormous sums paid to investment bankers and a select few senior executives in the sector. Those bonuses have continued to be paid as a matter of course, regardless of the fact that many of the institutions, all of which directly or indirectly benefited from the interventions of the Government over the past five years and continue to benefit from an implicit subsidy, have been making</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/9">thousands redundant, have seen their share prices and profits falling and have been found guilty of mis-selling payment protection insurance on a grand scale. To add insult to injury, Robert Jenkins, commenting on bank balance sheets, told the Treasury Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/10">&#8220;Every &#163;1 billion of less bonus would support &#163;20 billion of additional small business lending.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/11">It is no wonder that Sir Philip Hampton, the chair of RBS, himself said last week:</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/12">&#8220;Pay has been high for too long, particularly in the banks, particularly in the investment banks&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.188.1/2">It matters because, as the Governor of the Bank of England said last month, people have seen an extraordinary squeeze in their living standards, but the institutions and bankers at the centre of the crisis that created those problems are not only not suffering a gigantic squeeze on their living standards but continue to get very high remuneration, in part because the taxpayer has been forced to step in and bail them out.</p>

The two largest fines imposed on Northern Rock executives were less than the bonuses that they had received the preceding year.</p>

	<p pid="b.188.5/1">Ultimately, the taxpayer had to put about &#163;1.2 trillion into the system to support it. Juxtaposing that against the amount paid in tax by the sector, I am not sure that it comes to the same sum. I get the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. I do not deny that the financial services sector has contributed in tax receipts, but that is not outweighed by what we have had to pay out to save it from itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/2">The status quo will not do. Change is essential. In November last year, Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, said in his BBC &#8220;Today&#8221; business lecture that</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/3">&#8220;the single most important thing for banks and for businesses now is to focus on helping to create jobs and economic growth; and being able to do that requires us&#8212;banks in particular&#8212;to rebuild the trust that has been decimated by events of the past three years; and that rebuilding trust requires banks to be better citizens.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/4">I agree with Mr Diamond, but actions matter far more than words to people and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/5">At the Business Secretary&#8217;s instigation, the Government established the Independent Commission on Banking, for which he deserves credit. If its recommendations are implemented, they will help to deliver a banking system that supports our economy&#8217;s interests in the long term. However, a number of things must happen to address the issues in the short term, not least of which is the matter of remuneration, which can be corrosive of public trust in our banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/6">First, greater transparency on pay in the banking sector is needed. A good place to start would be immediate implementation of the Walker review. In 2009, Sir David Walker recommended new rules on the disclosure of bankers&#8217; remuneration within pay bands above &#163;1 million. In Government, we legislated for that fairly modest scheme to be put in place so that irresponsible remuneration practices could be identified and rooted out. So modest were the proposals that the now Business Secretary told the House at the time that Sir David had produced</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/7">&#8220;an embarrassing mouse of a report&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-11-30.900"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 November 2009; Vol. 501, c. 900</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/8">In the June 2010 Budget, the Business Secretary and his coalition partners pledged to take forward these modest proposals, but in November 2010 the Chancellor suddenly declared that he would not countenance implementation unless he could secure international agreement for the measures. In giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee in December 2010, however, RBS&#8217;s Stephen Hester indicated that unilateral adoption of the Walker review proposals would not put the UK financial services sector at a significant disadvantage. Given the modesty of the Walker review proposals, why on earth will the Government not implement them?</p>
	<p pid="b.188.5/9">Secondly, to increase accountability, we have said that an ordinary worker should be placed on the company remuneration committees setting pay. I do not understand why the Government have been so resistant to this idea. The Business Secretary has said that he is very sympathetic to the idea but has raised practical objections on the basis that there are many FTSE companies whose employees are predominantly overseas. These practical obstacles can be overcome, however, not least through technologies such as telephone and video conferencing, which in this day and age are a common feature of board meetings.</p>

	<p pid="b.189.0/1">Having a worker on the board is not just about accountability. Would it not also address the fact that remuneration committees tend to comprise people much like the people whose salaries and bonuses they are assessing? It is not surprising, therefore, that they decide in favour of higher bonuses and salaries. That is another reason a different voice is needed on the committees.</p>

	<p pid="b.189.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. First, an employee understands what is going on in the business&#8212;perhaps, in some respects, better than a non-executive</p>
	<p pid="b.189.1/2">director&#8212;and, secondly, employees have a stake in the business, and if the business fails, they ultimately pay the price, as thousands of RBS employees going through the redundancy process are now realising.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.0/1">I am certainly not against this sensible proposal to put employees on boards, but as I understand the Walker review and its recommendations, it does not meet the situation now. Instead of innovations, we need something so dramatic that we change the culture in our banking system and its understanding of what is right and wrong, as was mentioned earlier. The culture is what matters, but I see nothing coming from the Government that will fundamentally change the culture that motivates the people working in the sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.4/1">I am listening with great interest to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s extended exposition on the failings of the previous Labour Government. It is nice to see him joined by so many for such an extended mea culpa. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the question?&#8221;] My question is this: does he think that the objectives of a company executive should be to maximise shareholder value for his business, to do the Government&#8217;s bidding or to do the bidding of a broader range of interests?</p>

	<p pid="b.190.5/1">The hon. Gentleman asks a good question. Ultimately, of course, a director&#8217;s duty is to shareholders, but I take issue with those who suggest that the Labour Government did not introduce reforms, because we did introduce reforms, one of which was the Companies Act 2006, which changed the nature of company law so that other stakeholder interests could be accounted for. In some respects, though, shareholder interests are not necessarily completely separate from those of wider society. My strong view is that business and society are mutually dependent, and that goes for our banks as well. Banks rely on society to provide talent, skills and custom, and we rely on banks not only to perform a social utility function for individuals and businesses, but to provide growth and jobs. How does that relate to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about shareholder value? If a bank fails its customers&#8212;as happened, for example, in the payment protection insurance scandal&#8212;that has a knock-on impact on reputation, which can ultimately have a knock-on impact on profit, which is against the shareholder interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.0/1">I will move on, so that I can finish and others can get in.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.0/2">What else needs to happen? The banks are accountable to their shareholders, and the Government have told shareholders to be more active. A starting point should be for the Government to practise what they preach in relation to their shareholdings in the publicly owned banks, particularly in the setting of pay and bonuses. It seems that their default position at the moment is that they do not want to get involved unless forced to do so. That has to change. More responsibility is needed. The public rightly expect the culture of excessive bonuses to stop. That means that bank executive remuneration that is described as performance-related should be just that: related to performance. Very large bonuses should be paid only to reflect genuinely exceptional performance, if trust in the system is to be maintained. The public expect the same of other organisations enjoying taxpayer subsidies. Network Rail&#8212;part of an industry backed by a &#163;4 billion taxpayer subsidy&#8212;is a good example. It was planning to push through a new bonus scheme under which senior managers were due to receive 60% of their salaries as a bonus every year, and a further 500% at the end of each five-year funding period. That kind of bonus culture is unacceptable to people and difficult to fathom. Again, the Government did little to stop that, but in the end the Network Rail board saw sense.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.1/1">My hon. Friend is being generous in giving way. When bonuses are paid for performance, is it not also important that they should be paid for performance that is related to the activities of the people receiving them? They should not be bonuses that could depend on factors that have nothing to do with the activities of the directors concerned, as would have been the case with Network Rail.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.4/1">I will move on.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.4/2">Given that market mechanisms since the crash have not operated to rein in excessive pay in the banking sector, the bank bonus tax, we have argued, should be repeated, on top of the bank levy, in recognition of the fact that the banking sector owes a responsibility to society in general. If the claim that we are all in it together is to mean anything, the reintroduction of that tax is a must. It would create 100,000 youth jobs and 25,000 affordable homes. It would do immeasurable good to the reputation of the sector and support jobs, growth and business in the UK economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.192.7/1">That is not actually what we are arguing for. We have said, given that the Government have been lecturing shareholders on being more active in relation</p>
	<p pid="b.192.7/2">to their shareholdings, that the Government should of course take a more active approach to those banks in which we have a stake. As has been pointed out, however, the sector as a whole needs a change its culture; that applies across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.7/3">Right now, we need the Government to make good on their promise to implement credit easing, to relieve the credit squeeze on businesses. That plan was announced to great fanfare more than four months ago, but nothing has happened. I am glad that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40256" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr Hoban)</phrase> will be responding to this debate. Perhaps he can tell us what has become of the scheme. The lack of speed with which the Government have proceeded with it is in marked contrast to the actions of the German and US Governments, for example. In Germany, KFW doubled the amount of small business finance available very quickly over the past couple of years through its lending programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.7/4">Some people suggest that if we do all these things, wealthy bankers will simply move abroad. We are for ever being held to ransom by that threat. It is notable, however, that many of those who put that argument benefit from the status quo. They have been making the argument for a number of years, but they are still here. They tend to ignore the fact that it is the banks&#8217; shareholders&#8212;not just politicians and society at large&#8212;who are calling for reform. Shareholders such as Jupiter, F&amp;C Asset Management and Legal &amp; General have all reportedly told the banks to be sensitive to the popular mood, and to moderate pay rises to match sharp falls in shareholder returns. The Association of British Insurers is reportedly meeting all the banks at the moment, including Barclays. Those people also ignore the fact that bankers and executives in other countries are being required to change their ways. For example, our banks&#8217; US rivals are cutting bonuses by up to 30% at the moment.</p>

I am sure that the whole House will identify with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/2">I welcome the opportunity to debate business lending and the reform of the British banking system. As hon. Members are well aware, we face extremely tough economic circumstances as we weather the ongoing crisis in the eurozone and fix the underlying damage that the previous Government inflicted on the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/3">The UK banking sector in particular faces a long and difficult road to repair, unwinding the irresponsible and unsustainable excesses of the previous decade. In the aftermath of the worst financial crisis in almost a century, bank balance sheets are shrinking under market and regulatory pressure. It is absolutely right that we ensure that our banks build their capital and liquidity reserves in these turbulent times. It was because of that action that all our banks passed the European Banking Authority stress tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/4">It is stability that we are safeguarding for the long term by discarding the shadow Chancellor&#8217;s discredited tripartite system and implementing the recommendations of the Vickers committee. It is this Government who are ensuring that we build a stable financial sector with the capacity and the market confidence to provide sustainable lending to our most innovative, ambitious and entrepreneurial private sector firms.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.1/1">Given that the Minister feels that the industry is more stable, is he concerned to hear the chief executive of the National Australia bank, which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, say today that the bank might have to consider selling, or at least restructuring, the business&#8212;partly because the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme has contributed to the harsh business environment, which is why the bank is carrying out a review?</p>

	<p pid="b.194.2/1">The reason we have to have the austerity programme in place is to tackle the mess left by the Labour party when it was in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/2">As I was saying, we are seeking to reform the sector to ensure that it can lend to businesses in the long term, but we have also taken decisive action to stimulate credit in the short term. That is why the Government secured an agreement with the UK&#8217;s largest banks to provide &#163;190 billion of new lending to business in 2011. By the third quarter of last year, those banks had loaned more than &#163;157 billion to UK businesses, which is 11% above their implied target. That includes &#163;56 billion of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises&#8212;10% higher than at the same point in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/3">I noted that during the rather long speech of the shadow Business Secretary, he talked about lending but put forward no ideas about how Labour would tackle it, yet we in government have taken action to get the banks lending to businesses and to make sure that there is a supply of creditors to SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I have to say that many of the organisations that represent our SMEs will listen with incredulity to the Minister&#8217;s suggestion that credit conditions are somehow all fine and that all is well. The fact is that, according to the Bank of England&#8217;s latest figures, we have seen a net contraction in lending to SMEs in nine of the last 12 months. It is clearly still a problem. In fairness, the Government announced that they were going to provide some credit easing&#8212;admittedly when the Chancellor said so in his speech to the Conservative party conference, although I never quite understood what he was talking about&#8212;but so far we have seen absolutely no action. When will this credit easing system come into effect?</p>

	<p pid="b.195.2/1">I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would come up with some ideas, yet he took a rather lengthy intervention to demonstrate that Labour has no ideas about what to do. Let me set out some of the structural measures we are taking to tackle the supply of debt and equity finance to businesses, and SMEs in particular. We are continuing the enterprise capital funds, and we are simplifying and refocusing the venture capital trusts and enterprise investment scheme to encourage more equity investment in start-ups.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.3/1">The issue of lending to small and medium-sized businesses is much more complex than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> suggested. Some months ago I spent a day at Barclays SME sector lending centre in Birmingham. It is clear that many small businesses are focusing on paying down their existing debts, building up reserves, and using their existing overdraft facilities at around the 50% mark. Does my hon.

	<p pid="b.195.4/1">Indeed. My hon. Friend has made an important point which should be noted by the Opposition. Net lending takes into account not just banks&#8217; gross lending but decisions that businesses make to pay down their debt, and that is what we are seeing. We are seeing businesses deleverage in the same way as banks are deleveraging. I do not know whether the Labour party believes that banks should stop businesses paying down their debt in order to force up the net lending figures.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.9/2">I think that bank credit will remain the principal source of finance for businesses throughout the United Kingdom. That is why in our autumn statement we went further to ensure access to finance. Last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced two bold new credit-easing measures to provide up to &#163;21 billion of new lending for UK businesses. Through the national loan guarantee scheme, we are allowing participating banks to raise up to &#163;20 billion of funding with Government guarantees, lowering their cost of funding and enabling them to reduce lending rates to business by as much 1%.</p>

There will be a &#163;1 billion business finance partnership to co-invest in funds that can lend directly to middle-sized businesses and further stimulate non-bank lending channels for SMEs. Those schemes capitalise on the Government&#8217;s commitment to tackling the deficit that the last Government left behind. Unlike the Opposition, we are determined to safeguard our economic stability and protect our credibility in the world market&#8212;credibility which has secured our triple A rating and kept our interest rates at record low levels, and which allows us to pursue innovative credit-easing measures to reduce costs for businesses and ensure that more money goes where it is needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. For too long businesses have been dependent on banks for their finance.

	<p pid="b.197.2/1">The challenge is to ensure that banks are ready to lend and have the resources to do so. Project Merlin has delivered that. It is a more ambitious programme of ensuring the flow of credit to the economy than the previous Government tried or the current Opposition have even thought about.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">The credit easing schemes we have proposed are supported by businesses throughout the country, as well as by the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses. These schemes, coupled with our reforms to the financial sector, will ensure that the UK banking sector continues to provide the fuel for a private sector recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">After the excesses of the last decade, it is clear that we can only build a sustainable financial sector and a sound economy by reforming the regulation and structure of banks. Yesterday the House held the Second Reading debate on the Financial Services Bill, at which the shadow Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the right hon. Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>, found himself in the awkward position of being forced to defend the failed tripartite system of regulation that he designed. He did not strike the same contrite note that the shadow Business Secretary has struck today. The Bill debated last night abandons the dysfunctional tripartite system and returns micro and macro-prudential regulation to the Bank of England, making the Bank the single point of accountability for financial stability. It also creates a new and strong conduct regulator to promote competition and protect consumers. Through these changes, along with the Basel reforms, living wills and new resolution regimes, and the reforms to the structure of banking from the Vickers report, we are remedying what the Chancellor called</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/4">&#8220;the biggest failure of economic management and banking regulation in our country&#8217;s history.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-02-06.43"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 2012; Vol. 540, c. 43</phrase>.]</p>

Given that, does the Minister think Project Merlin has been a resounding success, or will he choose not to continue with it next year?</p>

	<p pid="b.198.1/1">Project Merlin set lending targets for banks. At the point of the third quarter, the targets for lending to all business had been achieved and those for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises had just been missed. Project Merlin therefore has certainly achieved in respect of its goal of getting credit flowing to the economy. I agree that businesses face challenges in borrowing money. They need to have a viable plan, and we need to work more closely with businesses to ensure that the support is in place to enable them to make successful applications for bank funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.2/1">We have a very large holding in RBS and we clearly will not be divesting ourselves of much of that holding for probably the next 10 years or so. What thought has the Minister given to using RBS, with its expertise and huge distribution network, as a mechanism for credit easing? I am sure that all Members hear from business people that these problems are not going to be solved unless we ensure that our SMEs have access to the capital that they so desperately need.</p>

We are changing that culture. Bonuses under the Financial Services Authority code are paid out over at least three years, in shares, not just cash, and failure can be punished by clawing back bonuses, and at both RBS and Lloyds cash bonuses will again be limited to &#163;2,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.5/2">Through the disclosure regime, we have provided more transparency than ever before, revealing the executive pay of the five highest-earning non-board executives for the Project Merlin banks last year. We are consulting this year on extending the requirement to cover eight executives at all banks operating in the UK, and UK banks now also have to disclose the aggregate pay of all their key risk-takers. These are some of the toughest rules in the world. It is because of our pressure and our leadership that the Commission&#8217;s capital requirements directive&#8212;CRD IV&#8212;contains proposals for additional regulations on remuneration disclosure which closely follow the recommendations of the Walker report.</p>

Will he now accept that it would be appropriate to repeat the bankers&#8217; bonus tax and create 100,000 new jobs and 25,000 affordable homes, and give a boost to the construction industry, which is on its knees as a result of his Government&#8217;s policies?</p>

	<p pid="b.199.4/1">I was going to discuss the bank payroll tax a little later, but let the hon. Gentleman just ponder for a while why the person who introduced that tax, the former Chancellor, described it as a &#8220;one-off and something that was not workable because it did not change the behaviour. What we have done is introduce the bank levy, which the Labour party opposed when it was in government, and every year it is raising &#163;2.5 billion more than the bank payroll tax raised in a single year. That is the product of well-thought-through taxation policy. We have gone ahead and imposed that bank levy, but the Labour party, when in government, opposed it.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.4/2">Let me discuss the interaction of bank bonuses and capital. We agree with the interim Financial Policy Committee that capital levels, not bonus payments, have to be the priority. Banks must strengthen their balance sheets as a foundation for lending to families and businesses. That is why the FSA is rigorously scrutinising bank distribution plans, and it will not approve plans unless they are consistent with required capital levels, ensuring that banks maintain the capital they need in order to finance businesses. It is because of our leadership that bonus levels have already started to fall. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, City bonuses tripled under Labour, and when the shadow Chancellor was Minister for the City they were &#163;11.6 billion. At the time, the shadow Business Secretary was carefully drafting the contracts to ensure that people could earn those bonuses. Last year, bonuses were almost half that figure, at &#163;6.7 billion, and we fully expect them to fall further this time. Thanks to the action we have taken, bonus pools have come down and Labour&#8217;s cash bonus culture has been ended.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.0/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to reflect on what is happening in banking. I think his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> even got as far, in last night&#8217;s debate on the Financial Services Bill, as suggesting that people should not use online banking so as to keep bank branches open. People are changing the way that they access banking and are thinking about whether they need to go into bank branches. We need to ensure that branches are there to meet needs where that is commercially viable, but there is no free lunch here. If the cost of maintaining branch networks continues to rise and insufficient numbers of people use them, the cost will be passed on to the customers who use the branches. The hon. Gentleman needs to think quite carefully about how many additional costs he wants to impose on bank customers in order to keep branch networks viable in that way.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.1/1">Is the Minister aware of today&#8217;s announcement by the Clydesdale bank about its restructuring programme, which it says is taking place as a result of the UK Government&#8217;s austerity Budget, which is causing difficulties for the bank and a difficult economic climate? It employs 2,000 people in my constituency.

	<p pid="b.200.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman had been here a little earlier, he would have heard my reply to his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Edinburgh East, who asked about exactly the same problem. The reality is that there are issues facing banks in the UK, and Clydesdale needs to reflect that. The hon. Member for Edinburgh East also raised the issue of the austerity programme, but that is in place to tackle the problems the Labour Government left behind.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/2">On corporate governance, the previous Government failed to tackle the bonus culture and failed fundamentally to reform corporate governance. The Business Secretary has announced a package of measures to tackle the disconnect between top pay and company performance. Shareholders need the information and powers to hold boards to account on pay. We will give them that and we expect them to use those powers. The Institute of Directors, the National Association of Pension Funds, the CBI and the Association of British Insurers all support the Government&#8217;s ambitions. As Otto Thoresen, the director general of the ABI, said when he wrote to bank chairmen last December,</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/3">&#8220;it can no longer be business as usual for this remuneration round&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/4">Across the board there is consensus that we need to tackle excessive pay and this Government are answering that, but it is not an easy task. Across the economy, and especially in the banking sector, the previous Government allowed an unjustifiable sense of bonus entitlement to grow, whether in the public or private sector. Under them, a bonus became a right, not a reward, and simply par for the course. After 13 years of Labour Government, we now have a substantial challenge ahead&#8212;dismantling the culture of excessive pay in the banking sector. We have already gone some way towards dismantling that culture, but we still have a long way to go.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.0/1">Will the Minister at least concede that this issue and the kind of perverse incentive structures we have heard about, with rewards for failure and excessive pay in the boardroom and the City, have grown over the past three decades under different Governments of different colours?

	<p pid="b.201.4/1">The Minister is being admirably forward-looking in his speech by trying to present where we should go for the future rather than focusing too much on some of the battles of the past. One of the biggest concerns in this area is about institutional shareholders who have large stakes in FTSE 250 companies and in our banks. How are we going to embolden them to use the notional power they have as shareholders? Many of them have 5%, 6% or 7% shareholdings and could do something. What is going to ensure that there is a culture of change such that they become shareholder activists rather than shareholders who sit on their hands and their dividends year on year?</p>

	<p pid="b.201.5/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point. The reforms outlined by my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary ensure that shareholders have the information they need to act. We are also giving them the power to vote and their votes will have a binding impact on future pay plans. The pervading culture today and the sense of concern in the wider economy means that institutional shareholders need to play their part by looking after the interests of the people who invest in their funds&#8212;the people whose pensions are dependent on good returns from their investments. Those shareholders owe an obligation to their customers to exercise their rights to determine the pay policies of boards. We need to focus on that in coming years. My predecessor, Lord Myners, talked about it a great deal. Our reforms have provided the tools and we must ensure that we use them to hold institutional shareholders to account.</p>

Indeed, the only person I can remember continually warning us about the consequences of the banking system was the current Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. In opposition, as a Lib Dem spokesman, he repeated the warnings so often and so apocalyptically that he became known as the Member for doom and gloom. I can assure Members that now that he is in a position to do something about it, the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills will interview him to see whether, in government, he lives up to the statements that he made in opposition.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for remembering accurately that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase> warned repeatedly, in the run-up to the crash, that we were heading for a crash.

	<p pid="b.203.1/1">I acknowledge that, shall we say, continued repetition on that theme earned the right hon. Gentleman a certain notoriety among Government Back Benchers of the time. Most people would look back and say, &#8220;Yes, there was some truth in what he said,&#8221; but they would also say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if he lives up to what he said.&#8221; That is what my Committee and I will seek to find out.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.1/2">The situation is profoundly worrying and contravenes the sense of fairness in this country. To most people in the street, there is something perverse about a system that punishes people on low and medium incomes for something for which they were not responsible, yet those who were responsible are rewarded. Even worse, that sense of injustice is compounded when the taxes of people on low and medium incomes finance that reward. It not only offends a deep sense of fairness but, it could be argued, it is socially and economically dysfunctional. That is the context of the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that among those who have the right to be most angry at what happened are the many thousands of people who work for banks, such as many individuals in my constituency, who are not on higher pay and do not receive massive bonuses, but who keep the banks going by working in offices, branches and so on? They are the real victims of this saga, more so than anyone else.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.3/1">I agree. Lower-paid bank employees, of whom I was once one many years ago, have suffered collateral damage as a result of the antics of those who were their superiors and managers. If we are to debate the matter in the round, we must make that distinction.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.5/1">No, I have given way twice, and there is a time limit on speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/2">There is a disconnect between wealth creation and money making in our society, which is offensive to our sense of fairness and bad for the economy as well. The business context can be demonstrated in a number of ways, one of which came home to me when I visited Rolls-Royce in Derby, and spoke to a bright, young girl at the company who was an Oxbridge engineering graduate. She told me that of her Oxbridge cohort she was the only one to go into engineering with an engineering degree: other engineers went into banking. Given the debate about the importance of manufacturing, engineering excellence and rebalancing the economy, to my mind, that demonstrates an important issue: we will not rebalance the economy unless we rebalance the rewards for working in different sectors. We cannot achieve one without the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/3">Another factor is the relationship between banks and industry. It is fair to say that the German economy has survived better than those of other European countries, and one of the reasons for that&#8212;I accept that it is not the whole picture&#8212;is the relationship between banks and industry, which historically have worked together on a much longer-term basis. German SMEs are not totally immune to the problems facing their British counterparts, but they are not nearly as great. The Minister set out the situation with Project Merlin and gave a litany of schemes that have been put in place to help small businesses, but the fact is that lending is falling. Probably every Member has an example of an SME in their constituency coming to them and saying, &#8220;If only we could get a grant or get the bank to help, we could invest this or buy that, and we would be able to employ more people and expand, and that could get us out of recession.&#8221; The fact is that there is a dysfunctionality in our banking system&#8217;s relationship with industry that is grossly impeding our ability to create jobs and grow our way out of recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> quoted Robert Jenkins, a member of the Bank of England&#8217;s Financial Policy Committee, when he made the point that &#163;1 billion less in bonuses could provide &#163;20 billion for SMEs. Banks must factor in risk when lending to businesses, but that &#163;1 billion, if diverted, would be written off their balance sheets anyway. Why not look at some scheme whereby money that might have been allocated for bonuses is diverted, either through taxation or another scheme, to lending for small businesses? That could make a huge difference to the capacity of small businesses to play a full role in growing us out of recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/5">Alternatively, we must look at tax. The bankers bonus tax would provide the basis for stimulating the economy. A high proportion of small businesses say they are not applying for loans because they are so lacking in confidence about their future prospects and current levels of consumer spending, and that is a barrier. Getting 100,000 more people into work as a result of that stimulus would help to overcome the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/6">I will conclude my remarks by acknowledging&#8212;one or two Members have mentioned this, quite validly&#8212;that our financial services industry in itself is hugely important to our economy, so we must be careful to ensure that any measures are proportionate and will not have unintended consequences that could damage the industry. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the industry is not serving our wider economy or society as well as it could do. The sorts of measures that the Opposition propose would go a considerable way towards changing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.5/7">We have a window of opportunity, with public opinion behind us and all the economic and social statistics demonstrating the validity of the case for taking action. The Government should lead on this, but at the moment they seem to be finding excuses for not doing so. If they would only apply to this matter the same resolution and commitment they have shown on welfare reform and other areas, we could have a change that would transform the economy and generate that sense of fairness in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.0/1">Here we are again in another Opposition-day debate centred on the economy, banks and bonuses. The handwritten notes I prepared earlier this afternoon read, &#8220;And yet again we hear no contrition from the Labour Front Bench.&#8221; However, as this is a debate and we have to respond to it, I will at least acknowledge that there was some contrition from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase>. I guess it must be easier for him, and indeed for his Front-Bench colleagues, who were all elected in 2010, to wash their hands of the last Labour Government&#8217;s decisions and offer at least some apology for what their predecessors did in office. However, it would be good to hear a collective apology from the Opposition, including those Members who were here in the previous Parliament, for the ineffective regulation and supervision of the banking industry, which was a major factor in the collapse of the banks and the economic failure and contraction that happened four years ago.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.1/1">On the point about contrition, will the hon. Gentleman not also call on Government Front Benchers to apologise for calling for less regulation prior to the banking crash in 2008? While on the subject, what about having some contrition from him about tuition fees?</p>

	<p pid="b.205.2/1">I am responsible for my party&#8217;s statements and, indeed, my party&#8217;s mistakes in certain instances but, as I said in my intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40647" name="Adrian Bailey">the hon. Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey)</phrase>, in the previous Parliament, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase> warned consistently about the coming economic catastrophe. The hon. Gentleman was not here at the time, but I think that he would have been ashamed to hear the jeering and cat-calling that my right hon. Friend had to put up with at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/2">It was the culture, not just the lax regulation, that led to some of the problems we have experienced in recent years. During the last decade of the Labour Government, executive pay rose on average by 13.6% per annum, while the FTSE share index rose by just 1.7% a year. In 2002-03, the bankers bonus pool, which is at the centre of the motion, totalled &#163;3.3 billion. In 2006-07, the year before the crash and everything starting to go wrong, the pool was &#163;11.4 billion. In the year of the crash itself, when all the bankers were staring into the abyss, the pool was &#163;11.5 billion. I do not recall any Minister at the time being worried about the size of the bonus pool or the distorting effect it must have had on executive behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.3/1">I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman finds this attitude terrifying, but I do, and it is on both sides of the House. We can blame the bankers all we like, but the truth about the problems across the developed world and the reason we are in schtuck is that successive Governments have not been able not to give in to demands to spend more money. In a global economy savvy investors and taxpayers&#8212;the best people&#8212;run off when they see a lynch mob. This is crazy.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.4/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting philosophical point about the whole culture that we have perhaps all grown up in over the past 30 years. It</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/2">would require more than an eight-minute speech in a three-hour debate to deal seriously with those issues, but I am trying to raise some of them. For instance, when considering how to respond to the outbreak of collective madness on the streets of some of our cities last summer, we should recognise that some of what he says is relevant to the feelings of dislocation and despair that some people felt, but it was also about out-of-control remuneration, lax regulation and complacent political oversight. Opposition Members do not like me saying this, but I say it every time and will say it again: a previous Labour Business Secretary, Peter Mandelson, said that new Labour was intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich. Because of that, we saw the dislocation of director and shareholder interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.1/1">No, because I have given way twice and I have a time limit, and the hon. Gentleman took rather a long time making his opening speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/2">All of this happened under the previous Government, and the coalition Government are now having to clear up the mess. We have heard once again that all that is needed is the magic wand of the bankers bonus tax but, as my hon. Friend the Minister has pointed out, in every year of this Parliament, under the coalition Government, more money will be raised&#8212;&#163;2.6 billion&#8212;from the permanent levy on the banks&#8217; balance sheets. It is the behaviour of the banks, and their boards in particular, that needs to change, rather than necessarily the pay and remuneration of their employees, which I remind the House is now taxed at a higher rate than it was when Labour was in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/3">The behaviour in the boardroom needs to change, especially in the remuneration committees. As I understand it, the Walker report, which is mentioned in the Opposition&#8217;s motion, simply recommended that remuneration of bank employees over &#163;1 million should be disclosed in broad pay bands, which is hardly revolutionary.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/4">The Merlin agreement, an interim measure while we await the implementation of more wide-ranging banking reforms, now states that a bank&#8217;s five highest-paid executives, as well as its chief executive and chairman, have to disclose their remuneration, so at least seven people each year now have to do so. That is the highest number in any global financial centre and more than in the United States, and, as the Minister pointed out, bonuses at the banks that are under effective state control, such as Lloyd&#8217;s Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland, are limited to &#163;2,000 in cash, with anything beyond that having to be offered on a deferred basis in shares.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Business Secretary has responded to the High Pay Commission with a series of measures that were announced a couple of weeks ago, and central to those is changing the behaviour and composition of the remuneration committees, so that on the forward pay agreements that they recommend for approval they have binding votes: not the advisory votes that were in place under the Labour Government, but binding votes, so that shareholders really are empowered to make a difference and to instruct directors, who are supposed to have stewardship of their investments in those companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/6">That will end the revolving door, whereby executives of one company become non-executives and sit on the remuneration committees of another, and whereby inevitably it is in everybody&#8217;s interests constantly to bid up pay in each quoted company. Indeed, they will also have to state how they have involved and consulted employees of what, in many cases, are global companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/7">Labour, in its manifesto at the most recent general election, said&#8212;I had someone check this for me before the debate&#8212;that it would</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/8">&#8220;strengthen the 2006 Companies Act where necessary&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/9">I remember that legislation, which, along with the Crossrail Bill, was probably the least popular Standing Committee on which a Member could sit, because it was such a fat Bill and its proceedings went on for so long, but there was nothing in it proposing the regulation of corporate pay. Throughout the previous Government&#8217;s 13 years in office, they did little to act on that issue, and despite the huge legislative opportunity that they had in 2006 they did not seek to strengthen shareholder power.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/10">The manifesto went on to state that Labour would strengthen the UK stewardship code for institutional investors so that they would have to declare how they vote on remuneration policies, which in turn should be approved by directors. It was silent on the interests of employees, and the shadow Business Secretary did not say much about that this afternoon, either. He certainly did not commit to having an employee on the board of every company.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/11">It is the behaviour of the banks, not just their remuneration policy, that needs to change. One of the first acts of the coalition Government was to set up the Independent Commission on Banking. We have now had the Vickers report, but in our proceedings on the Financial Services Bill, which received its Second Reading last night, we went through all those issues, so I shall not go through them again today.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/12">We also need a change of behaviour at company annual general meetings, whereby shareholders really engage with the power that they have over their companies. Recently I met the charitable group FairPensions, which is urging institutional investors, the pension fund managers who act on behalf of many of us, our constituents and local authorities, to use their power at company meetings in order to control executive pay and to act as responsible investors.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/13">Some hon. Members may have noticed that I tabled early-day motion 2678 last week, supporting the Move Your Money UK campaign. Mr Speaker, you and I are of roughly the same political generation&#8212;although from different points on the spectrum. We would first have become involved in politics during the 1980s. So we would have been students at the time of the Boycott Barclays campaign, and indeed I had a Boycott Barclays poster up on my bedroom wall as a student. I suspect that you did not, Mr Speaker, but people of my generation will remember that the behaviour of consumers can make a real difference to the behaviour of companies, so I urge all hon. Members&#8212;I hope this is a cross-party issue&#8212;to support my early-day motion and to urge all our constituents as consumers to consider the behaviour of companies when they use their purchasing power as well as when they exercise their power as shareholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.1/14">There has been systemic failure for quite some time, as the Opposition Front Bencher at least acknowledged. There was reckless behaviour by Mr Goodwin, but there was reckless behaviour also in the Cabinet room by the last Labour Government. The coalition Government are clearing up the mess. We are putting in place regulations and legislation to control pay policy, to introduce transparency into the implementation of that policy and to regulate the banks so that we have a sustainable financial services sector and sustainable banks, which are so essential to supporting the businesses that are required to grow our economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" speakername="Michael Meacher" colnum="208"  time="018:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0002.htm#12020783000124">
	<p pid="b.208.0/1">No one can seriously doubt that Britain urgently needs fundamental banking reform, but what has been done so far, since the crash of 2008-09, is timid beyond belief. Hardly any of the factors behind the crash have been effectively dealt with. Extreme light-touch regulation left too much to the markets; a vast global market was created in credit derivatives, which were not well understood but were recklessly securitised throughout the world because of their huge profitability; the selling frenzy was stoked even further by enormous bonuses, which drove the recklessness; the banking structure was so over-concentrated in the lead banks that, when disaster struck, they were judged too big to fail, with catastrophic and desperate consequences for the national budget and debt; and the business model linked speculative investment with retail deposit-taking, with the former as well as the latter protected by an implicit taxpayer guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/2">All those problems, which were familiar to all of us, need to be dealt with, but none has been, partly because of the intransigence of the banking lobby in resisting reform, and partly because of the weakness of political supervision. That makes another crash quite likely, but if there is we might find it much more difficult to get public support for a bail-out.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/3">First, no significant action has been taken to curb complex financial derivatives, which were, perhaps more than any other factor, central to the collapse. Derivatives are the obvious candidate to trigger the next crisis, because they add opacity and leverage to the financial system. The obvious requirement is transparency, and in the United States that was provided by the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires that all derivatives be traded across public exchanges. We all know that in this country some highly dubious securities gained a spurious status due to the scandal of the credit-rating agencies, which were paid by the very institutions whose creditworthiness they were supposed to assess. That ought to be made illegal; better still, the function should be transferred to the public sector to ensure integrity and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/4">Secondly, there is public outrage&#8212;even now at this late stage the Government find it difficult to accept it&#8212;at a banking system, which owes its continued existence to massive Government intervention, paying itself mega-salaries and bonuses, and at the fact that 90% of investment bank profits are, in an age of austerity, directed not at strengthening balance sheets, not at shareholder dividend, not at lower fees for customers, but at gigantic personal pay-offs.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/5">Ministers say that to do what some countries such as France are doing, with a mandatory cap and the removal of the bonus guarantee, is impractical, but there can be</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/6">no doubt that, if the G20 Governments insisted on limits and made continued liquidity provisions dependent on compliance, no bank could refuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/7">Thirdly, to avert financial crises, the Government have placed far too much emphasis on enhancing capital controls, and they have done so in a manner that is unlikely to be effective. At the outset of the 2008-09 financial crisis, almost all financial institutions across the globe had capital adequacy at least equal to, and in some cases even twice as much as, the minimum Basel regulatory requirements. But, despite the near-global collapse of the system under those provisions, Basel III proposed in 2010 that the core top-tier capital requirement be only 4.5% and the contingency capital requirement be only 2.5%. Of the EU's top 50 banks, 45 had already met those requirements, and Basel III does not even require them to come into force until 2019. For the Government to accept that is incredibly feeble. It is far too little, far too late and it reflects the Government&#8217;s connivance with the banks in minimising reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/8">Fourthly, the Vickers commission proposals that the Government, unsurprisingly, have accepted are weak and deeply flawed. Trying to separate retail banking from investment banking with some kind of internal Chinese walls is doomed to failure because of regulatory arbitrage. Financial institutions always invent ever more sophisticated products simply to get around regulatory controls. That is the argument for a clean break between retail high-street banking and investment casino banking. That would have the key advantage of removing the implicit taxpayer guarantee, which allows financial conglomerates safely to use retail deposits for proprietary trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.0/9">Britain arguably retains the most profoundly dysfunctional banking system of any G7 country. It came closer to collapse than any other in autumn 2008. The banking sector in this country is twice as large, relative to the rest of the economy, as in any other major EU country. It is stuffed with mega-banks that are addicted to property, mortgage lending, offshore speculation and tax evasion. Barclays Capital is only the most obvious example of that. Britain needs a much more diversified banking structure with smaller banks, in particular specialist business banks such as infrastructure banks, housing banks, green banks, creative industry banks and knowledge economy banks.</p>

	<p pid="b.209.1/1">I wholly agree with the hon. Gentleman. The mega-bonuses go along with small businesses having to pay exorbitant interest charges, if they can get a loan at all. The Financial Secretary says that the Government are doing their best with RBS, but why do the Government not tell RBS what level of business lending there should be and what the conditions on it should be?</p>

	<p pid="b.210.1/1">The hon. Lady has obviously received a detailed RBS briefing. However, what she describes is very different from the experience of our constituents, who complain about how difficult it is to get loans and about the prohibitive conditions that are attached to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/2">I want to make one more point. It is little recognised that 85% of the British public&#8217;s money is held by just five banks, which are able to use that money with little or no accountability to the public. Investment in the UK economy therefore reflects the interests not of the public or of society, but of the senior decision makers at the five largest banks. Given that the total gross spending of the banking sector in the run-up to the crash exceeded by far total Government spending, the decision makers in those banks potentially have more spending power to shape the UK economy than the whole machinery of Government. That is a significant fact. In effect, control over the money supply and the allocation of credit has been largely privatised. That is central to Britain&#8217;s problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/3">Britain needs above all to escape the dangerously mounting deficit in our traded goods account, which in the last two years has been up to &#163;100 billion a year or 7% of GDP. The allocation of credit cannot be left in the hands of private commercial banks, which currently channel only 8% of the money supply into productive investment. Instead, they generate colossal asset bubbles through mortgages and household borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/4">What is needed is the re-adoption of the rationing of bank credit through official guidance, enforced where necessary through quantitative ceilings. That prevailed successfully in this country until the 1971 competition and credit control measures, which inaugurated the era that said that the market always knows best and in which the deregulation of finance depended almost exclusively on the price mechanism and variable interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/5">Bonus figures released last week show that the top 1,250 executives in the eight leading London banks received an average of &#163;1.8 million in 2010. That is &#163;34,000 a week. What is really needed in banks, as elsewhere, is whole company pay bargaining, whereby the pay at each level, including at the top, has to pass the examination and approval not just of shareholders, but of the employed staff who are the bedrock of the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.2/1">Before I was elected to this House, I spent a 15-year career in small business in IT and software, during which I experienced the ups and downs that are typical of start-up businesses. I also experienced the ups and downs of dealing with banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/2">Entrepreneurs such as me and my colleagues felt that there was a gap between the risks that we were taking as entrepreneurs and the attitude of the banks, with their demands for personal guarantees and other security, and their occasional unwillingness to negotiate credit terms. When I have talked to small businesses in my constituency over recent months, I have heard similar stories about the attitudes of the banks. I hear about foreclosures on viable businesses, sudden unannounced changes to credit terms, and people who have worked hard to build a business being forced to face impossible choices. I welcome the action that the Government have taken to unblock credit and, as the Financial Secretary described, to improve the appeals process when companies feel that they have been badly treated by their banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/3">A big gap opened between the banking culture and the entrepreneur and the small business man, and that gap has grown into a chasm. As other hon. Members have mentioned, our banking culture grew up during the boom and the banking industry became disconnected from the needs of the real economy. It became a self-reinforcing culture in which bonuses and rewards simply got out of control. We then had a spectacular bust that took many viable small businesses down with the banking industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/4">This debate is important because Britain&#8217;s future depends on our building a viable, dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Jobs growth will come only from a viable culture of small and medium-sized enterprises. Britain&#8217;s future depends on our fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, in which people are prepared to take risks to create new businesses. We need a banking sector that is designed to support that vital endeavour. We also need the banking sector to play a central role in rebalancing the British economy. It must help to create the businesses and infrastructure that we need in places such as the black country, part of which I represent. That is why I welcome the Government&#8217;s introduction of the banking levy, which will help to funnel investment into areas such as the black country.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/5">The banks also have a wider moral duty to rebuild the British economy after the follies of the boom years. It is therefore right that we take steps to control the bonus culture in British banks and seek to reform the banking sector. That is why I welcome the Government&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/6">However, we must not allow ourselves the indulgence of engaging in anti-business rhetoric or appearing to be anti-business. It is perfectly viable for us to be against the bonus culture that built up but also very pro-business, and it is important that we are. We need to celebrate the success of entrepreneurs, wealth creators and small businesses. As I have said, they represent the future of the British economy and create the jobs and skills that we need for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/7">As I learned in my 15 years as an entrepreneur, business is about profits and cash. However, there is also a moral dimension to business and the capitalist system. One of the proudest moments of my entrepreneurial career was receiving a commendation from Investors in People for how my business managed people. My motivation as an entrepreneur was about both profits and people. In the capitalist system, it is vital that people who take risks are rewarded, but also that they recognise the moral dimension of the capitalist system.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.2/8">We need banks to play a role in building a culture of what we might call &#8220;responsible capitalism&#8221;, which can promote the entrepreneurial culture that Britain desperately needs to secure its future.</p>

	<p pid="b.212.0/1">I rise to support the motion. I will begin with the obvious point, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> also made, that however poorly some of our banks behaved, they are an essential part of our infrastructure and will be an essential driver of ensuring that our economy improves. The question, however, is whether we relied on them too much, which has to be answered with a resounding yes. When the crash came, we not only had to bail out some of the banks that had become too large to fail but lost a huge percentage of our revenue.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/2">A wry smile comes across my face when I see the crocodile tears of Government Members for manufacturing industries, because I remember the period from 1979 to 1997, when I was a young man, when a lot of them were responsible for the demise of manufacturing. That ensured that my late father lost his job in heavy engineering and never got back into it.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/3">Although RBS has become a byword for profligacy, we have to recognise that other banks, such as Barclays, did not request or need a bail-out. We know that we live in difficult times, but today the National Australia bank announced a review of its Clydesdale bank and Yorkshire bank. Combined, they employ 8,500 people in this country and have two UK networks, and the NAB is to re-evaluate its UK wing. Cameron Clyne, the NAB&#8217;s chief executive, said in his statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/4">&#8220;It is clear that the UK economy is likely to experience a much longer period of subdued growth with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the Euro-zone and the continuing austerity program by the UK government.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/5">Perhaps the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>, can respond to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/6">Government Members take great glee in complaining about what they describe as the mess that was left behind, despite the fact that we are nearly two years into their time in government and even though the urgent action that we in the UK took led the world. However, they should remember the saying, &#8220;What goes around comes around.&#8221; The chief executive of the NAB was actually saying that their economic policies are contributing to the problems that it is facing, because the Government are concentrating on austerity measures, not the growth of the economy. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point instead of jumping over it as the Minister did.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/7">Although I recognise that the banks make a significant contribution to our economy, their reward structure and behaviour have been brought into sharp focus in the past four years. Based on the experience of businesses in my constituency, banks went from a Viv Nicholson &#8220;Spend, spend, spend&#8221; policy on lending to a Steptoe and Son penny-pinching policy. The businesses in my constituency with which I have been involved tell me that RBS wants to charge them exorbitant interest rates</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/8">for safe, copper-bottomed business deals and has put itself first instead of looking after small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/9">Most outrageously&#8212;Ministers should take note of this&#8212;RBS stands accused of deliberately putting in place conditions to put businesses out of business, so that it can reclaim their assets at the cheapest price possible. That is an outrageous way for a bank to do business when the economy is in such difficulty. We need to ensure that we keep people in employment so that they can contribute to the wider good.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/10">The remuneration situation is even more bizarre. When my colleagues were speaking earlier, I heard some chuntering among Government Members about the fact that business people who get large bonuses pay their taxes. There are many millions of our constituents who also pay their taxes, and I bet they wish they were getting the remuneration packages that are being given out in RBS.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/11">As a former trade union official, I have negotiated more pay deals than I care to remember. In the civil service, in the early days of performance-related pay, the reward structure was changed from plain salary to salary plus a performance-related element. Irrespective of which bargaining unit I was dealing with, I always asked how performance would be defined and what an individual would have to do to get that additional payment. In 26 years as a lay and then full-time trade union officer, I never got a straight answer to that question. A job is a job, and someone is paid a salary to do it, but in response to that question I was given platitudes such as &#8220;We&#8217;ll give it to someone who puts in an effort above and beyond the norm&#8221;, and &#8220;We&#8217;ll reward exceptional performance.&#8221; However, when we tried to dig a little deeper into what those words meant, answer came there none.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.0/12">We have to remind ourselves that the salary package that people such as Stephen Hester get is pretty significant in the first place. We therefore need to know the definition of exceptional work that brings a bonus. That needs to clearly outlined and transparent.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.0/1">I am a little bit puzzled by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s argument and that of the Labour Front Benchers on bankers&#8217; bonuses and salaries. Are they against bankers&#8217; salaries only, or all very high salaries? He mentioned Stephen Hester, but Carlos Tevez earns five times as much. Why is the Labour party not honest enough to say that it wants higher taxes instead of just focusing on bankers?</p>

	<p pid="b.213.1/1">The crucial point that has come through in this debate is that RBS is owned by the public. Up until last week, when Stephen Hester did the right thing and announced that he was not going to accept the bonus, Government Members remained silent. Ministers said that it was up to him, if my memory serves me correctly&#8212;if the Minister wants to intervene, I will be happy to allow him to do so. The Prime Minister said that it was up to Stephen Hester. In relation to Carlos Tevez, I am not a Manchester City fan, so I will leave that issue alone. I have enough problems with Glasgow Celtic football club without worrying about Manchester City.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.0/1">The hon. Gentleman seems to make a distinction between entities that are state-owned and those that are not. Is he therefore saying that if Hester worked for a non-state-owned entity, the hon. Gentleman would be quite happy with his bonus package? That seems to be the implication of his answer.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.1/1">There must be responsibility across every business, whether it is private or public. I am not a communist&#8212;the hon. Gentleman will be delighted to know that. I do not suggest that we move to the Cuban model and are all paid the same for doing different jobs, as I recognise that people have different contributions to make and should be paid different salaries for doing so. Often, examples that go to the extreme, such as those about footballers, and that go into other systems of capitalism in the country in which they work do not take the debate much further forward. My analogy is between the civil service and the Royal Bank of Scotland, as the civil service is in the public sector as is the Royal Bank of Scotland, because we own the largest share in it. The difficulty we had in defining performance-related pay in the civil service reads across, it strikes me, to the difficulty we have in defining performance-related pay in the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.3/1">I think I have been generous enough in giving way, and other Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.3/2">On bankers&#8217; bonuses, it appears that when the behaviour being rewarded is non-productive&#8212;the Royal Bank of Scotland and other banks have not met their Merlin targets and, in each of the past 12 months, they have not met their targets for lending to SMEs&#8212;it is surely a case of the emperor&#8217;s new clothes. Bankers&#8217; bonuses cannot be based on an opaque set of rules. They are a travesty, a charade and the practice should be outlawed not only in RBS but in other organisations that cannot properly define a performance-related pay system. The era of these unacceptable bankers&#8217; bonuses must come to an end, as we need a direct relationship between reward and performance. Most importantly, the Royal Bank of Scotland has an economic duty to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises to ensure that the economy of our country starts to improve. On that note, I commend the motion and I will support it tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.4/1">I welcome the debate and want to discuss a number of issues that arise from the motion, but, having explored it, I think it contains a strong hint of political expediency and opportunism.

	<p pid="b.215.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point and I hope that some of my comments later will enthuse her about my stance on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/2">Not many people would disagree that we need to move from irresponsible banking practice to responsible but successful banking, from poor Government regulation to effective regulation, from bailing out the banks to getting taxpayers&#8217; money back, from the state ownership of banks to putting them back into private ownership, and from the state guaranteeing banks to ensuring that they stand on their own two feet and are not too big to fail. We need to draw some important distinctions when we consider such matters. There is a distinction between taxpayer-owned banks and private banks and we also need to take into account the taxpayer guarantee. When we consider irresponsible bankers&#8212;who now seem to be epitomised by Fred Goodwin, who should not be singled out but seems to be taking the brunt of the blame for all the irresponsibility in the banking industry&#8212;there should be a distinction between their type of banking and the more responsible banking that many are trying to promote.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.0/3">One person who was brought in to try to promote more responsible banking and to get RBS back on its feet was Stephen Hester. He came in and took on a job, and although we might all agree or disagree with the definition of the success that he was tasked with bringing about, the fact is that he was given that definition&#8212;I think by the Labour party, when it was in government&#8212;and now Labour seems to want to move the goalposts and change the definition of success or failure within his remit.</p>

	<p pid="b.215.6/1">I will not give way. We need to be careful that we do not vilify people who we entrust with such positions&#8212;we should not vilify wealth creators, because they are the very people who we need to get UK plc back on to its feet.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.6/2">That brings me on to regulation. The tripartite system given to us by Labour clearly failed; we had banks that were thought too big to fail, with no proper checks or balances on their activity. I am pleased to say that the Financial Services Bill, which had its Second Reading yesterday unopposed, will change that situation of ring-fencing banking, so that we no longer have banks that are considered too big to fail.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.6/3">That leads me on to other issues, particularly the bailing out of the banks, state ownership of banks and state guarantees for banks. They are all probably undesirable for the taxpayer and it is important that we work to try to reverse the unsustainable position that the taxpayer has been put in. We need to consider carefully how we facilitate our banking and finance industry to ensure that we can try to right the wrongs. One way of doing that is through the regulatory framework, which we are dealing with, but we can also do it through competition. We must be well aware of global competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.6/4">I did not take part in last night&#8217;s debate on the Financial Services Bill, but spent some time listening to speech after speech from Opposition Members saying that regulation of our banking system needed to take into account the global situation that our banking industry found itself in. I totally agree, but they must therefore acknowledge in tonight&#8217;s debate that our banks must be competitive within that global market. Vilifying our banking and business sectors with an unbalanced argument and approach and putting excessive taxes on those sectors will move us away from having banks that are competitive in that global environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.215.6/5">That brings me, quite neatly, to the bankers&#8217; bonus tax, which is mentioned by the Opposition time after time. They seem very keen on that tax, which they mentioned before the Government put in place the bank levy, which raises &#163;2.5 billion a year, rather than the &#163;2 billion that the bankers&#8217; bonus tax would have raised. The goalposts seem to have moved again and the Opposition seem now to be advocating that it should be an additional tax for the banks to pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention; I apologise that time is short.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/2">Lending to small business is extremely pertinent, and it is important that it is in the motion, but we should not forget that we need to encourage our banks to lend to small businesses rather than curtailing lending. One of the most important areas in which we need to do that&#8212;it has been mentioned by Opposition Members&#8212;is manufacturing industry, but they forget to mention that the reason we are in our present position is that the economy was completely unbalanced and we lost 1.7 million manufacturing jobs under their party.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/3">To conclude, although the motion might be populist bordering on opportunist, it does little to solve the problem of irresponsible bankers and poor regulation. It takes no account of the importance of the banking industry not just to bankers but to the rest of industry and commerce in this country and to the UK Exchequer. It does little to get banks to stand on their own two feet, repair their balance sheets and lend again, and it does little to set out a proper strategy for creating sustainable employment for our young people, an agenda that this Government are now tackling with vigour.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.3/1">I welcome this important debate, the ramifications of which stretch far beyond the banking sector in particular and economic policy in general. The issue of high pay and bonuses is central to the kind of society that we want to live in. I share the disgust and outrage of my constituents at the fact that successive Governments have allowed the incomes of the wealthiest 10% of the population to rise 37% in the past 10 years while those of the poorest 10% have fallen by 12%, and that the earnings of top executives at Barclays have increased by a stratospheric 4,899% since 1980, while wages for the average worker at the bank have increased only threefold.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/2">We have heard much about a more responsible economic system in recent weeks, and I welcome that debate, but unless that fine rhetoric is backed up with concrete and far-reaching action, I fear that we will merely see more of the same bankrupt business as usual. The first thing we must do to address properly the concerns raised today is ask one important prior question: what purpose do we actually want the banks to serve?</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/3">I believe that banks ought to be useful servants of a productive economy and of the new economic, social and environmental challenges that we face. Introducing a statement of purpose requirement for banks and banking activities, in order to allow regulators and customers to assess how much or how little those activities contribute to a productive economy that serves and protects the environment, would be a useful starting point. It has already been done by the German Sparkassen network of community banks, and would go some way towards giving power back to people and allowing them a say in the future of our banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/4">The bottom line is that markets alone cannot deliver the kind of banking system that we need&#8212;one that is safe and fit for purpose. Governments must step in, and</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/5">not just when bail-outs are required. Tackling pay at the top end of the sector is an important first step. I support a special tax on bankers&#8217; bonuses, but we should make it permanent. At the top rate of 50%, Labour&#8217;s one-off tax raised about &#163;3.5 billion for the Exchequer, but did not do anything like enough to curb the excessive bonus culture, as we now see. Curbing Stephen Hester&#8217;s bonus and stripping Fred Goodwin of his knighthood are a start, but let us not pretend that throwing some red meat to the tabloids is a substitute for urgently needed thoroughgoing reform of the banking system. In the absence of major re-regulation, our financial system remains dangerously dysfunctional.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/6">If we are intent on curbing excessively high pay, as we should be, we must recognise that it is not a problem in the finance sector only, and match any action with measures to improve wages at the opposite end of the scale. That means supporting a genuine living wage and considering policies such as a 10:1 ratio between the highest and lowest-paid staff of a company, or a guarantee that no member of staff should receive an annual bonus exceeding the annual wage of the lowest-paid worker in that business or organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/7">I have said that tackling pay was just one part of the challenge. There are many others: 3 million people in the UK do not even have a bank account, and 9 million lack access to affordable credit. Banking reform must address that urgently as well. A universal banking obligation could ensure a taxpayer quid pro quo for future bank support. It would have to cover where banks lend and include a banking code to ensure that everyone has access to essential financial services. A people&#8217;s bank could operate via the post office network to address financial exclusion and provide real, fairly priced competition in local communities. A UK community reinvestment Act would ensure that banks lend money where they are prepared to take deposits. We also need to separate banks&#8217; retail and commercial arms properly, not just ring-fence them as the Government plan to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/8">Ecological theory suggests that a system is most resilient when it is divided into compartments to protect it from external danger. In order for banks to be resilient, they too should be modular, without excessive connections between them that can transmit shocks rapidly through the system. For that reason, serious restrictions on inter-bank lending and derivatives trading and the reintroduction of exchange controls designed, among other things, to reduce sharply international flows of money between banks should be explored in much more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/9">The next round of quantitative easing may well be announced on Thursday. Recently, I met the man credited with inventing the term. He explained that he was in Japan at the time and wanted to talk about credit creation, but that those words in Japanese meant something different. Credit creation goes to the heart of how the banks operate. The current economic system enables commercial banks and other financial institutions to exert an unacceptably large influence on the economy. Now is surely the moment for us to challenge the virtual monopoly that we have allowed the private banking sector to exercise over credit creation.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/10">One step towards achieving that might be to introduce green quantitative easing. We know that during the last round of QE, the Bank of England purchased &#163;275 billion in Government bonds, yet that money did not find its</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/11">way into the real economy or help small businesses get loans. Green quantitative easing would inject money directly into the economy, circumventing the paralysed banking system. By purchasing green assets such as solar photovoltaic assets for a nationwide roll-out, for example, we could create far more jobs, stabilise the economy, reinvigorate our local businesses and reduce our emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.3/12">There are many other things to be said, and I have only 20 seconds left in which to say them. We need diversity on our high streets. We need more community banks and credit unions. We will not get the banking system that we need if we leave it to a monopoly of four or five main high street banks. We need a diversity that we can learn from ecology. If we bring that into our banking system, we might just have a chance at a banking system fit for purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.3/1">That is a very good point. Perhaps the hon. Lady will be interested to know that I am leading the establishment of an enterprise investment scheme fund in Bedford to get local people to invest in jobs and create businesses in Bedford. Government Members believe in practical action to support entrepreneurs and jobs, not the empty rhetoric that we get from Opposition Front Benchers. I invite her to Bedford to see the successes that we are having and from which perhaps her party can learn. The shadow Business Secretary made some interesting points, and I only wish that he had had time to speak more about his idea for moving forward with a UK equivalent of the small business investment company in the United States. That is an interesting direction of travel from the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/2">It is always hard in a free society to explain or justify why some people earn more&#8212;sometimes fantastically more&#8212;than other people. That justification can be secure only when clearly based on merit&#8212;the merit that comes from taking a risk that works out or from delivering exceptional performance. It is clear, however, that throughout large swathes of the economy, those two forms of merit have been losing hold in the setting of compensation in our country. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40291" name="James Morris">the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris)</phrase> spoke eloquently about that disconnect between the financial sector and our entrepreneurs. I know that the Government are committed to changing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/3">It is sensible to look for measures that focus remuneration more on merit, but that is precisely what the Government&#8217;s recommendations seek to do. The problem with the speeches from Opposition Members was that they could not define the problem that they were trying to solve. Were they trying to solve the problem of compensation in state-owned enterprises? Were they trying to solve the problem of compensation in banking? Were they just hostile to high compensation generally in the economy? They could not define the problem owing to the different points of view among Opposition Members. Some call for a return to the rhetoric of the 1980s, attacking people for earning too much money and trying to draw false and upsetting comparisons between people who get paid a lot and those who cannot find a job.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/4">In this country, we need to support the risk takers and the entrepreneurs to create the jobs that people in my constituency and constituencies around the country want. The promotion of an anti-business rhetoric will</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/5">be harmful. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40463" name="Marcus Jones">the Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones)</phrase> said, the reaction to Mr Hester&#8217;s bonus sent the unwanted signal to business that this country was anti-business. As many have said today, Members on both sides of the House have a responsibility to make it clear that that is not the case and that we all want business to be strong in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/6">Strengthening shareholders&#8217; responsibilities will be central to that. One of the perhaps unintended consequences of the raid on pension funds by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> was to weaken the ability of shareholders, particularly pension fund holders, to hold boards to account over remuneration. There was a change in the ownership of shares, which increasingly went offshore, while those custodians of long-term interests&#8212;our insurance companies and pension funds&#8212;had their voices and representation weakened on boards. It is right, therefore, for the Government to consider in detail how to strengthen shareholder representation and control over compensation in general.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/7">Several speakers made the connection between banks and support for small business. I ask the Government to be bolder in looking for alternatives to banks in meeting the challenge of financing our small businesses. We need to consider ways of growing bond markets for small business, and we need to go even further than we already have by adopting innovative schemes for promoting equity financing for our small and medium-sized businesses. There is no more honourable a thing for people with money today to do than putting it into equity and our small businesses, and the Government have already provided tax incentives for them to do so. I only encourage the Minister to do more.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/8">On credit easing, will the Minister be cautious about the ability of Governments to stimulate the economy in the short term? By the time that Governments get round to deciding what to do, often the problem has passed. However, credit easing presents another opportunity, which is to use financing, through a credit easing facility, to reduce some of the long-term debt obligations in this country. As the Minister knows, I have spoken before about the possibility of using either some or all of the credit easing financing to create a future fund and unburden the next generation of taxpayers of some of the tax that would otherwise be needed to meet the unfunded public pension liability. We must look to the long term when considering how to fund our small businesses, and not always think that the Government have the answer in the short term. They rarely do.</p>

	<p pid="b.221.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">The hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> said that we must reward the risk takers, but is not the problem and the reason for this debate the fact that the risk takers took too many risks with the world economy and completely destroyed it, and that while destroying the world economy, they got massive bonuses, pay and entitlements to which they were not entitled? That is why we need to look at these risk takers, who he says are the wealth creators.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/2">Opposition Members have no problem with business or with people who want to work hard, achieve, create jobs and stimulate the economy, but it is important to</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/3">remember&#8212;this is what this debate is about&#8212;that, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his party conference speech last year, there are producers and there are predators. As always, those comments were taken out of context, but what he talked about is what the Prime Minister now talks about: responsible capitalism and responsibility in society.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/4">In the light of that, we are having this debate, which is not surprising&#8212;in the light of that, we are having this debate. I repeat myself because it is important to know why we are having the debate. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> said, this debate on the crisis is timely but, more importantly, the question is: how do we prevent the problem from reoccurring? We should be concentrating on that, instead of the point scoring that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/5">We realise that there have been problems with the regulation of the banking and the financial services over the past 20 or 30 years. As my hon. Friend said, the Opposition have accepted responsibility and acknowledged that the Labour Government could have done more to regulate the sector, but as has been pointed out no one in the Conservative party at the time complained or argued that regulation should be tighter&#8212;if anything, they asked for even less regulation. Nevertheless, they continue to say, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221; We have accepted our mistakes, but Government Members made them as well. Furthermore, as everyone knows, the relaxation of regulation started in the &#8217;80s, when a Conservative Government were in power. It is about time that they apologised for getting this whole thing going.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/6">I do not want to get into a party ding-dong. I want to talk about what we can do to help to create a situation in which businesses and banks can work properly and the country can prosper. The Opposition have argued that the Walker review, which states that, if a banker&#8217;s remuneration is more than &#163;1 million, that information should be published, should be implemented as soon as possible. That, coupled with the recommendations of the independent High Pay Commission, should be implemented in full, with investors and pension fund managers required to disclose how they vote on remuneration decisions, so that those paying into pension funds know where their money is going. Additionally, to boost transparency, the Government should publish figures setting out the largest pay ratios.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/7">Another thing that we should be doing is using our influence in the banks in which the taxpayer has a stake to restrain excesses and promote good practices. Where the Government&#8212;the state&#8212;have discretion, they should intervene, such as with Network Rail recently. We should introduce a framework for fair pay across the economy, including through employee representation on remuneration committees and measures to enable greater shareholder activism. We should repeat the tax on large bank bonuses and use the money to get 100,000 young people into work. In tough times, when there is less money around, fairness matters more than ever. Instead of providing leadership, the Government have been dragging their feet on tackling excessive pay and rewards for failure. They have taken 20 months to come forward with any plans, and they are delaying even those that they are implementing. That is in stark contrast to the autumn statement, which took three times as much from families with children as it did from the bankers.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/8">As we know, Robert Jenkins, a member of the Bank of England&#8217;s interim Financial Policy Committee, told the Select Committee on the Treasury:</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/9">&#8220;Every &#163;1 billion of less bonus would support &#163;20 billion of additional small business lending.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/10">I urge the Government to act on that, and to support Project Merlin&#8212;which we do not think has been as successful as it should have been&#8212;to ensure that the banks involved in the scheme lend more. Evidence has shown that investment and credit lending by those banks has decreased by 6% in real terms, whereas investing and giving more credit would be a real step to boost the economy. At the end of the day, some of the banks have been bailed out with public money. They and the Government should be doing more to&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.223.1/1">In opening the debate, the shadow Business Secretary stressed the importance of a strong financial sector and called for a new culture, given the high pay and excessive bonuses that we have seen. Many of us on the Government Benches agreed with what he said in that direction and with the overall tone that he struck. He was asked how much money had been given away in bonuses under the last Government. According to my figures, &#163;66 billion was paid out in bank bonuses under the last Government. Much of that was encouraged by the last Government, for the massive tax revenues that it generated, with more than 50% coming back to the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/2">Much has been made of the linkage between businesses and bank lending, but I would dispute that. We need to see much more lending to small businesses, but, as I explained in an intervention, the reason for the current lending issues is not just that the banks will not lend. Opposition Members do businesses a disservice by continuing to promulgate the myth that banks will not lend, because one reason that businesses are reluctant to approach banks is that they think they will be rejected. We must not engage in too much rhetoric, accusing the banks of not lending, when RBS, for example, grants 85% of the loan applications that it receives from small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.2/1">First, I accept that the reason there is not as much lending to SMEs as one would expect is not just because of the banks, but because of people&#8217;s confidence in the economy&#8212;one might argue that the Government&#8217;s policies have had an effect on that. Secondly, I pointedly made it clear in my speech that it is not just a question of the banks not getting the money out of the door to robust, profitable businesses; rather, it is a question of their relationship with their business customers in this day and age. Often, people are put on the phone to some person in a regional office who knows nothing about their business and is therefore not in a position to assess the risk properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.3/1">First, on the causes of why businesses are not seeking loans to invest, that has much more to do with the eurozone crisis and the global economy in general. For any company seeking to export, there is a general nervousness across the world&#8212;not just in the west, but in China and the far east. Secondly, I agree</p>
	<p pid="b.223.3/2">with the hon. Gentleman about banks losing a lot of skills over the past 10 to 20 years in managing their business customers, but I see signs of change. I visited Barclays in Birmingham a couple of months ago, and I sensed the real commitment, along with an upgrading of skills, that that bank&#8212;to name one&#8212;is making to its business customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.2/1">I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend&#8217;s speech. Further to her discussion with the shadow Business Secretary, there are new entrants to the high street lending market, which I think, without name-checking them and giving them the publicity, will shake up the &#8220;Computer says no&#8221; culture. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Name them.&#8221;] Virgin Money is coming on to the high street, and it will shake up that culture. Sometimes we are in danger of talking about just the traditional high street banks and lenders, when there are new entrants coming into the market that will really shake things up and change things.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that excellent intervention. Indeed, I attended a Virgin-sponsored event last week at which its youth capital fund was launched, to try to get money available for young entrepreneurs as seed finance, so I very much agree with his point.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/2">The Opposition want us to raise taxes&#8212;again&#8212;to fund a youth unemployment initiative, but I strongly object to the motion. We cannot do enough for youth unemployment&#8212;I agree with that. It is an absolute scourge in my constituency, so I am pleased about the new proposals we are seeing, with the youth contract getting &#163;1 billion in funding, which will create 410,000 work opportunities for our young people. We are also seeing record numbers of apprenticeships across the country. I would therefore argue that the Government are doing all they can to support young people back into work, which I absolutely agree is a challenge facing us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/3">I want to speak on behalf of taxpayer interests, because we all own a stake in two of our high street banks. I also want to talk a bit about the protection of our tax revenues, as well as employment in the financial services sector, because I fear that by raising yet another tax on bonuses&#8212;on employment, essentially&#8212;we are jeopardising that investment. The shadow Business Secretary is the acceptable face, perhaps, of the Opposition, but many other Opposition Members, including the shadow Chief Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase>, alighted on one individual&#8212;Stephen Hester&#8212;a couple of weeks ago, repeating the mantra that &#8220;It&#8217;s all about rewards for failure.&#8221; The record really ought to be set straight when it comes to RBS. She should not judge the performance of that company just on the share price, and she is pedalling a half-truth when she does so. She should look at the repair of the company&#8217;s balance sheet and the extensive disposal programme undertaken by RBS, which is on track despite incredibly difficult market conditions. The capital ratios have been improved, with SME lending by the</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/4">bank making up 40% of total bank SME lending, which is higher than its market share. This country and its taxpayers would be dealt a mighty blow if the chief executive, Stephen Hester, were to react to the terrible publicity that he has had to endure by leaving that taxpayer-owned bank. Who do the Opposition think would want to take his place, after all that has happened?</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/5">On the question of the bonus tax&#8212;I shall choose my words carefully&#8212;I feel that taxes are plenty high enough already. The Opposition are proposing to raise them even higher, however. On any employment income at the level of bank bonuses, the higher rate tax of 50% applies. With employers&#8217; national insurance and a degree of personal national insurance on top of that, the effective tax rate on some of those bonuses is already more than 60%. Let us not forget, too, that under the Government&#8217;s proposals, everything in a state-owned bank bonus apart from &#163;2,000 in cash has to be deferred and taken in shares. If the individual then sells their shares, that will incur capital gains tax at the increased rate of 28%.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.3/6">I shall finish by issuing a warning to Members on both sides of the House. In the days of the last-but-one Labour Government, under whom I grew up in the 1970s, the top marginal rate of tax was 98%. Do the Opposition really want to take us back to those times, during which enterprise was absolutely stifled?</p>

	<p pid="b.225.0/1">I had not intended to speak in the debate, but Lloyds TSB has today announced 300 job losses in Scunthorpe, as part of 1,000 job losses across the country. That is on top of the 30,000 job losses that have been announced by that organisation over the past three years. I want to talk about the importance of the banking sector in our communities as a provider of jobs and services at local level. Too often, the debate is about the banks and bankers at national level, and that has been well covered in today&#8217;s debate, but it is important that we also remember the value of the banking sector within the communities that we represent. Another case in point in my constituency is the announcement by HSBC that it is to close its branch at Kirton-in-Lindsey. It is the only branch for nine miles, and its closure will have a significant impact on the way in which that community manages its business.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40291" name="James Morris">The hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris)</phrase> made a thoughtful and insightful contribution to the debate. He drew on his experience of the disconnect between the banks, on the one hand, and the small and medium-sized enterprises and the communities of which they are a part, on the other. He said that it was possible to be anti-bonus but pro-business. There is unity across the House on that point. We need a better and more responsible capitalism that better serves the people of this country. Excessive pay and rewards for failure are bad for shareholders, bad for the economy, bad for society and bad for business. I hope that the people listening to the debate, in the banking community and in the communities that we serve, will recognise the importance of banking as a provider of services and jobs in our communities, and as an engine of the growth of this proud nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.0/1">There are some basic questions of fairness that people in Britain feel strongly about, and we have to reinstate that fairness. In 1979, the top pay at Barclays was only 14.5 times that of the average pay. It is now 75 times higher. Did people not want to work at the top of Barclays then? Did they not want to work hard for their bank? I think that they did. The problem is that the top levels of pay have accelerated to a level that no one considers fair. The suggestion that, if we do something about that, people will go elsewhere and that we will be unable to recruit seems strange. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">The hon.

	<p pid="b.226.2/2">In fact, in 1979, the inequality gap, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was at its lowest in the entire post-war period. Does that matter? I suggest that it does. If I were an employee of Barclays, working as a teller or in a back-room job, my motivation to work hard would go down as I learned about the huge disparities in pay. This is not about jealousy, or about feeling that people should not be able to earn. If we want people to accept, as we have suggested, that we cannot increase public sector pay in the way that we want to, and if we are all in this together, it has to be fair. That is primarily what the motion is about. Those who do not support it will find that, rather than wanting to dig in and be &#8220;all in this together&#8221;, people will be dissatisfied and demoralised, and our businesses simply will not grow.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.5/1">I am disappointed that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has not been willing to explain the Government&#8217;s failure to follow through on the Walker review&#8217;s recommendations on transparency and high pay. I am disappointed that the Chancellor has not been willing to explain why they oppose the inclusion of ordinary workers on remuneration committees. I am</p>

	<p pid="b.226.5/3">People up and down the country are amazed when they read about individuals receiving bonuses in a single year that amount to more money than most people will see in their entire working life, especially at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, when small businesses are finding it hard to access finance, when people are finding it hard to get a job, and when many young people are struggling to get their first job.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/4">The &#8220;Oxford English Dictionary&#8221; tells us that a bonus is</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/5">&#8220;a sum of money added to a person&#8217;s wages as a reward for good performance&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/6">It goes on to say that a bonus is</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/7">&#8220;an extra and unexpected advantage&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/8">It is clear, however, that for a few, bonuses have come to be expected, an automatic part of their pay. Whatever their performance or that of their businesses, bonuses can be cashed, year in and year out. That seems to be the case even when the share price is falling, even when thousands of jobs are being lost and even when lending targets to small businesses are not being met. And this is happening in an industry that is significantly supported by us, the taxpayers, and that risks rapidly losing the trust and confidence of those it is supposed to serve, because of the actions of a few at the top.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/9">Let me speak plainly. Labour Members recognise the importance of the financial services sector to our economy. A high proportion of jobs in my constituency are directly or indirectly dependent on the continued success of Leeds as a financial hub. Private sector employers whom I meet tell me time after time of the critical importance of bank finance to their ability to grow and employ more people.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/10">The financial services industry is, and must remain, a strong part of the British economy. It offers an opportunity for Britain to play a positive role in the global economy and it plays a critical part in supporting the small businesses that could be and should be the driving force of our economic recovery. That makes it all the more important that Members are not afraid to approach the banking sector as a critical friend&#8212;not afraid to deliver home truths or the views and perspectives of the people we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/11">In expressing public concerns about excessive bonuses, we must remember that the vast majority of people who work in banks earn modest salaries. Those I know in Leeds are on salaries of &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 a year, and they find these six or seven-figure bonuses as shocking and alien as the rest of us do&#8212;especially a few years after failures in the banking sector brought the global economy to its knees.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/12">These are the concerns we have heard in contributions to today&#8217;s debate. It must be a matter of regret that throughout this afternoon, save for the Education Secretary, no Cabinet member has been here to hear them. It is a shame that no Cabinet members were present to hear the passionate speeches by, for example, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>, whose constituents are fearful this evening for their jobs. It is a shame that no Cabinet Minister is going to respond to the concerns expressed in the passionate speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for East Kilbride, Strathaven</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/13">and Lesmahagow (Mr McCann), for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) and for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi) or of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>. Those Members spoke about the increasing disconnection between a small number of people at the top of the banking sector and the experiences and values of the rest of the country. This disconnect must be repaired if we are to strengthen the national purpose and shared interest that we need to get through these tough economic times.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/14">It is a shame, too, that no Cabinet member will respond to the contributions about struggling businesses&#8212;especially to the thoughtful contributions of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40647" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey)</phrase>, who spoke about the dysfunctional relationship between banks and industry, which grossly impedes our ability to grow out of the recession, and of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase>, who forcefully rebutted an intervention suggesting that the banks are lending. That suggestion was totally out of touch with the experience of small businesses in all our constituencies. The reality is that many businesses are being refused the loans they need to tide them over or to keep people in work. We all need a banking sector that lends, supports small businesses and acts as a sector that we can trust and rely on.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.5/15">We also heard contributions from the hon. Members for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris) and for Bristol West (Stephen Williams), which I thought added important dimensions to today&#8217;s debate. I want to pick up on the contribution by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40463" name="Marcus Jones">the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones)</phrase>, as he would not let me intervene when I tried to do so earlier. Both he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> seem to disagree with the decision of the RBS chief executive to hand back his bonus, when I had thought that every Member of every party would welcome that. The fact is that the chief executive of RBS earns a salary in excess of &#163;1 million a year&#8212;46 times more than the average worker. That should be reward enough for doing his job; he should not be getting a bonus of &#163;963,000 on top of that when few others could expect to earn that sort of salary in a lifetime.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.0/1">Will the hon. Lady explain the Opposition&#8217;s policy on creating growth in the financial sector? We have heard a great deal of criticism about everything, about how dreadful bonuses are and all the rest of it. That is fine, but what is Labour&#8217;s policy for growth, for being creative and for going forward?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.228.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" speakername="Rachel Reeves" colnum="228"  time="019:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001065">
	<p pid="b.228.1/1">We have argued a five-point plan for jobs and growth&#8212;to put money in the pockets of ordinary families with a VAT cut and a national insurance holiday for small businesses that are struggling to take on new workers. Those are the sort of policies that will get the economy moving again and will protect jobs in all our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/2">We should welcome the RBS chief executive&#8217;s decision to hand back his bonus. The reality is that, over the last year, the RBS share price has fallen, it failed to meet its lending targets and it laid off workers. As I said, I would have thought that a salary in excess of &#163;1 million is reward enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/3">Today&#8217;s debate, however, is not about one man or one bonus or one bank; it is about the need for an overhaul of the way in which bonuses and pay are structured. As my hon. Friend the shadow Business Secretary has spelled out and as many contributions have highlighted, issues of pay and performance&#8212;of individuals and of the banking industry as a whole&#8212;cannot be separated.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/4">Banks need to show that they recognise the need to change, the need to reform their business models, the need to rebuild their relationships with small businesses and customers and, most of all, the need to restore public trust. The British people deserve a banking system that they can believe in and respect&#8212;a banking system that inspires trust and is seen as a responsible custodian of our earnings, our savings, and our pensions. I know that the majority of people who work in banks at all levels also want to feel proud of the job they do, so today&#8217;s debate is about beginning to restore that trust and integrity.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.1/5">Opposition Members have set out clear, constructive proposals in three key areas: transparency, accountability and fairness. <i>[Interruption.]</i>On transparency, the Labour Government legislated for the implementation of David Walker&#8217;s recommendations on high pay, including for rules to disclose the numbers of employees paid over &#163;1million a year. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.229.0/1">Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but Members are holding conversations in the Chamber, but they expected others to listen to them when they made their speeches.

	<p pid="b.229.1/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think that some Members do not want to hear the truth.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/2">Transparency would give shareholders the vital information they need to rein in excessive remuneration, but what have we seen from the Government? No answers and no action. On accountability, the High Pay Commission has recommended the inclusion of an employee on company remuneration committees. We have called on the Government to legislate, but what have we had? No answers and no action. Yet again, on the matter of fairness, when banks continue to award bonuses beyond most people&#8217;s imagination at a time when everyone else is being squeezed, why will the Government not do what is right and tell the banks that if they continue to pay out large bonuses, they will impose a tax to ensure that some of that money comes back to the taxpayer? Hundreds of thousands of young people have been looking for work for months and even years now, struggling with the consequences of a crisis that was caused by the financial services sector for which they are paying the price. That is the real crisis our country is facing&#8212;the crisis of more than 1 million young people out of work, but what do we see from this Government? We see no answers and no action.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/3">On transparency, on accountability and on fairness, our constituents want answers and they want action, so why do the Government not take responsibility? At the end of the day, it comes down to priorities. Labour&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/4">priorities are those of the British people: of families facing a squeeze in living standards, of the 1 million young people trying to find work and of the thousands of good businesses trying to stay afloat.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/5">By contrast, this Government&#8217;s priorities are increasingly clear: a tax cut for the banks and a quiet life for the Cabinet. Well, we can tell the Government that this issue will not go away. We will continue to raise the concerns of voters and if this Government will not take the necessary action, the public will draw this conclusion&#8212;that this out-of-touch Prime Minister just does not get it, that his Cabinet colleagues do not get it either and that the Labour party is the only party that does.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.0/1">We have heard 11 interesting contributions from Back Benchers, although I cannot say that the last contribution was either interesting or, indeed, informed. I should begin by drawing the House&#8217;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/2">I have to say that the last contribution was in sharp contrast to the more emollient tones of the shadow Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase>, who actually admitted&#8212;I think for the first time from the Dispatch Box&#8212;that Labour got it wrong on this issue when it was in government. What is not clear, however, is whether he cleared those remarks with the shadow Chancellor. It seemed that this set of remarks was new to a number of faces on the Back Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/3">We heard very good contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris) and for Nuneaton (Mr Jones) and excellent contributions, too, from my hon. Friends the Members for Bedford (Richard Fuller) and for Stourbridge (Margot James). We heard an interesting contribution from the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40647" name="Adrian Bailey">the hon. Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey)</phrase>, who pointed out that it was my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase>&#8212;<i>[Interruption]</i>&#8212;who, notwithstanding the shouting and screaming from Labour Members, highlighted the existence of real challenges and problems when his party was in opposition. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will be happy to acknowledge that.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/4">Let me begin by making it clear that this Government have an absolute commitment to addressing excesses in the banking system that were allowed to go unchecked and unregulated for much of the 13 years before we came to office. It was a system in which light-touch regulation and record bonuses were encouraged by a Government who were keen to reap the rewards. Since coming to office, we, as a coalition Government, have made a return to responsible banking a key priority. We have taken concerted action to ensure that, in return for extensive taxpayer support, banks must once again live up to their obligations to support the wider United Kingdom economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/5">That is why, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury pointed out, we are discarding the discredited tripartite system and implementing the recommendations of the Vickers commission. It is also why we are actively supporting the flow of lending to businesses, especially small businesses, so that they can</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/6">gain access to the finance that they need if they are to invest and grow. We on these Benches passionately support the entrepreneurs and hard-working small business owners who create the wealth and jobs on which the rest of us rely.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/7">There has been some discussion about the Merlin agreement this evening. Let us be clear about that. Under the terms of the agreement, the five major UK banks committed themselves to making &#163;190 billion of new credit available last year. Of that new lending capacity, &#163;76 billion was dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises, which would be a 15% increase on the previous year. The latest figures, for the third quarter, show that the banks are broadly on track. At that point banks had lent more than &#163;157 billion to UK businesses, 11% above their implied target, and three&#8212;Barclays, Santander and HSBC&#8212;have all made recent statements to the effect that they have met their Merlin targets. We await the final figures, but that is good news that we should bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/8">Moreover, a report from my Department, to which the motion refers, reveals&#8212;although I did not hear this from Labour Members&#8212;that three quarters of SME employers are being given the loan or overdraft they request. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge rightly pointed out that it is wrong to suggest&#8212;as some Opposition Members do&#8212;that no small firm can obtain a loan.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.1/1">I will not give way. The hon. Gentleman spoke for 45 minutes, which meant that Back Benchers did not have a chance to contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/2">I understand&#8212;we understand&#8212;that to the 25% of SME employers who do not obtain that loan or overdraft, the fact that 75% do will be no consolation. That is why the Chancellor is taking decisive action to provide some &#163;21 billion, &#163;20 billion of it under the national loan guarantee scheme, which will be available over two years and will allow banks to offer lower-cost lending to smaller businesses. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Notwithstanding the chuntering of Opposition Members, that scheme is supported by the Federation of Small Businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI. The details will be made clear in the next few weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.231.3/1">No, I will not give way to the hon. Lady. We heard a diatribe of clich&#233;s from her, but we heard no policy, no original ideas and no original thoughts.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/2">We are also making available an initial &#163;1 billion through a business finance partnership that will allow small businesses to invest through non-bank channels. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> was absolutely right to say that we should not just consider the bank channels, but should ensure that other players in the market can come forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis&#8212;who, unlike many Opposition Members, has actually run a business&#8212;was also right to draw attention to the importance of choice and competition. I agreed with the shadow Business Secretary when he said that we should think about the business model and the return of relationship management. I hope that we shall hear some positive contributions about that from Labour, and not just the usual flannel.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/3">The Opposition motion refers to the need for a reform of banking, and to the need for more regulation and responsibility. The motion is right to refer to responsibility; it is just a shame that that was not one of Labour&#8217;s policies when it was in government. However, I suppose that it is nice to have a convert, even if the conversion is late in the coming.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/4">Yesterday the Chancellor introduced the Financial Services Bill, demonstrating that we would overhaul the regulatory environment that we had inherited. The Bill&#8217;s principles are important: responsibility, prudence&#8212;I think we may remember that word&#8212;and sustainability. That means addressing the old system of excessive and irresponsible levels of pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/5">As we have heard this evening, under the new FSA remuneration code we have ensured that bonuses will be deferred by at least three years and linked to the performance of employees and companies. Through the disclosure regime, we are providing more transparency than we ever saw from the Labour party when it was in government. Bonus levels are already starting to fall. As we heard earlier, last year they stood at &#163;6.7 billion, just half as much as when the shadow Chancellor was the City Minister in the last Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.3/6">This evening&#8217;s debate has also dealt with the wider issue of executive remuneration. The Government strongly believe that successful people who work hard should be properly rewarded. It is vital that, in a debate about the excesses of a few, we do not give the impression that enterprise and endeavour are unwelcome in Britain; but, sadly, quite a few Opposition Members simply do not understand that. We need to make our message clear. The Government are determined to work with businesses to reform executive pay, and to do so in a way that strengthens business in Britain in the long term. As was alluded to but never actually examined by the hon. Member for&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.237.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.237.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes that metal theft is becoming a serious issue for the UK; welcomes the Government&#8217;s announcement on introducing a cashless system and higher penalties; is concerned that the comprehensive package of measures which is needed to address this issue is not being introduced at the same time; believes that to effectively stamp out metal theft there needs to be a radical change in how the scrap metal industry is regulated; and calls on the Government to introduce a number of additional measures as a matter of urgency, including a robust licensing scheme for scrap metal dealers to replace the present registration scheme, a licence fee to fund the regulation of the licence, greater police powers to close unscrupulous scrap metal dealers in line with alcohol licensing, police authority to search and investigate all premises owned and operated by scrap metal dealers, use of photo identification and CCTV to identify sellers of scrap metal, and their vehicles, vehicle badging for mobile scrap metal dealers, and magistrates&#8217; powers to add licence restrictions and prevent closed yards from re-opening.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.3/3">First, may I express my thanks to the hon. Members for Dudley South (Chris Kelly) and for Worcester (Mr Walker) for co-sponsoring this topical Back-Bench debate and to the Backbench Business Committee for allowing Members of this House to debate this issue tonight? I also wish to mention my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40646" name="Tom Watson">the Member for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson)</phrase>, who first raised this issue back in 2010. I understand that just last night, in the other place, metal theft was once again the subject of much discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.3/4">Metal theft is at epidemic levels. Industry is being hard hit by daily thefts and the general public are not only horrified at the escalation and cost, but disgusted at the theft of Britain&#8217;s heritage; reports of war memorials being desecrated have shocked the nation. We have seen lifeboat stations without communications, and last month Llandough hospital in Wales had to cancel 80 operations because of cable theft. Remote rural broadband services across Britain are too frequently knocked out. The Energy Networks Association claims that there has been a 700% increase in theft from the energy networks between 2009 and 2011. The Association of Chief Police Officers conservatively puts the cost at &#163;770 million. I believe that a lack of accurate reporting&#8212;there is no specific crime code&#8212;probably means that the true cost is higher, but Deloitte puts the figure more conservatively at between &#163;260 million and &#163;600 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.4/1">Is not one of the key factors the disproportionate relationship between the value of the metal being sold and the cost of replacing it? For example, manhole covers are being sold for a few</p>
	<p pid="b.237.4/2">quid but the cost to Sandwell council of replacing them is &#163;400, and it is losing 40 or 50 of them a month. A similar comparison can be made between the price of the cable that is being stolen and the disruption to travel. Should not the penalties reflect that cost rather than the value of the metal?</p>

	<p pid="b.238.2/1">I would like to make some progress, if possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/2">The British Transport police state that there are eight attacks on the transport system each day, and that is of grave concern. Ecclesiastical Insurance reported that in 2011 there were 2,500 lead thefts from church roofs. Perhaps most shockingly, the War Memorials Trust estimates that one memorial is vandalised every week in the UK, and for only a very small amount of metal. Today&#8217;s debate is a reminder of the urgent need to tackle this scourge and of the importance of doing so; with the Olympics around the corner, it reminds us of the threat to essential services. Paul Crowther of the British Transport police described metal theft as</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/3">&#8220;the second biggest threat to our infrastructure after terrorism&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/4">Nigel Martin, the head of supply at Wessex Water, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/5">&#8220;Any one of these cable thefts can turn into a civil emergency.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.238.2/6">The Government&#8217;s response so far has been unclear. My comprehensive Bill was rejected, despite its forensic drafting by the Public Bill Office&#8212;I wish to thank the people there. The announcement of a ban on cash trade and the introduction of unlimited fines for those trading in stolen metal are welcome steps. However, the Government&#8217;s announcement misses key elements that underpin the success of a cashless payments system. First, a robust licensing system is required to overhaul the inadequate and flawed Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964. Secondly, and as importantly, we need a UK wide taskforce to gather best practice and to bring together the key partners: the United Kingdom Border Agency; Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs; the Environment Agency; local government, the National Crime Agency; banking; local police forces; and, importantly, industry. Those bodies need to come together in a positive way to tackle this scourge.</p>

	<p pid="b.238.3/1">My hon. Friend mentioned church roofs. Is he aware that insurance companies now have a &#163;5,000 limit and will pay out only on that, but in most cases that does not get anywhere near covering the cost of the stolen lead?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.238.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" speakername="Graham Jones" colnum="238"  time="019:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001624">
	<p pid="b.238.4/1">I am aware of that, and it appears that that figure is falling as a result of the escalation in lead thefts from church roofs. That is of some concern, especially as insurance is very hard to come by for some of the churches that have suffered.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.4/2">The measures in this motion were agreed by the affected industries and, importantly, by members of the all-party group on combating metal theft. However, the Government&#8217;s two announcements somewhat sit in isolation, and that is where the concern lies. The Legal</p>
	<p pid="b.238.4/3">Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill is an unsuitable legislative vehicle, so we need to move beyond it. It appears to be have been commandeered at the 11th hour and, unfortunately, no other measures have been allowed to be added to it. The Bill only passed through this House last November and notably absent were any measures to tackle metal theft. That raises further questions about this House&#8217;s ability to scrutinise last-minute amendments from the Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.4/4">In November, the Chancellor announced a &#163;5 million pilot which has been started in the north-east&#8212;Operation Tornado. However, it will not report back until July, when the Olympics begin and Parliament starts its summer recess. I am concerned about that, as the approach being taken all seems a little disjointed, and I appeal to the Minister to bring coherence to the Government&#8217;s strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.4/5">Metal theft is a very particular type of crime. That is because, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" name="John Spellar">the Member for Warley (Mr Spellar)</phrase> said, its effects are disproportionate to the impact it has on other people; stealing &#163;20-worth of metal can cause &#163;100,000-worth of damage. Such a theft can remove a war memorial or result in the loss of life, and it cannot be calculated in financial terms in some cases. A theft in the Dartford tunnel area caused &#163;29 million-worth of damage and a recent metal theft in Glasgow caused a further &#163;14 million-worth of damage, including the part closure of a hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.238.4/6">Metal theft is also a very particular type of crime because the effectiveness of policing it is limited; the nation&#8217;s metal estate is so vast that there is not a police solution. The Government must look more intelligently and co-operatively if we are to &#8220;design out&#8221; the problem. We are talking about a failure of regulation and of joined-up working, not of policing.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.1/1">I have only 10 minutes available and I would like to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/2">In 2010, only 21 people were proceeded against under the 1964 Act, and only 18 were found guilty and sentenced. Of these 18, 10 received a fine and eight were given a conditional discharge. The average fine was &#163;379, and only once was the maximum of &#163;1,000 used. I welcome the response by the Home Secretary on sentencing and the comments of Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who recently said that the Crown Prosecution Service would be taking a &#8220;firm stand&#8221; against metal thieves and would spell out the level of public disgust to judges.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/3">Unfortunately, I am never shocked by the scale of criminal activity in the scrap metal industry. Cash is king for one reason and HMRC needs to wake up to that, as the Treasury is losing millions in revenue. A sting article in the <i>Daily Mail</i> last week exposed the size of the problem in the industry, as 40% of the dealers approached accepted metal that the undercover journalist told them was stolen. Shockingly, none of them reported this alleged crime to the police, and this is simply not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/4">Two previous sting operations by BBC London and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> have shown that those cases are not isolated. The measures called for in the motion will support honest dealers who play by the rules. Without</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/5">those changes, the dishonest and the criminal will have a commercial advantage. I welcome the story of a south London scrap metal dealer, Stuart Nebbett, who is donating &#163;21,000 to replace stolen plaques from war memorials in south London.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/6">The industry needs reform. Last night, in the other place, the Minister stated that a robust licensing scheme would be brought in &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221;, but I should like to know when and how. I do not want to see any drift on this matter or any relaxation of tough regulation. The way to deal effectively with this crime is to choke it off at the point at which it enters the system, before war memorials can be laundered through apparently legitimate metal dealers and before all traceability is lost. Legitimate dealers are being infected through actions at entry-level points in scrap metal trading. The public need a commitment from the Government that they will introduce a full licensing scheme funded by a licence fee. That is the first step towards fully legitimising the scrap metal industry and is a prerequisite to the introduction of cashless payments, as it would provide a robust legal framework with traceability at the heart of the process, particularly by giving magistrates the power to add licensing restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/7">There is also a need for increased powers for police to enter, search and close the premises of those suspected of dealing in illegally obtained scrap metal. At the moment, they require a warrant to enter premises that are not registered by the local authority. It is important in identifying stolen metal entry points that the Environment Agency waste carrier notices are enforced and that other agencies and, crucially, the public can identify itinerant traders and, at the other end of the scale, illegal containerisation with the introduction of vehicle badging.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/8">The robust measures called for in the motion are one half of the solution, but good practice is the other half and I am concerned that we might turn a blind eye to good practice should we regulate the industry. Together, those two kinds of action will free up scarce resources to deal with displacement of the crime and to allow the agencies involved to shift resources to the hardcore criminals who will seek to divert their criminal activities away from regulated scrap metal dealers.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/9">I conclude by affirming that the House wants to know what the Government are going to do and when they are going to do it. Lord Henley said last night in the other place that</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/10">&#8220;as soon as possible&#8230;by whatever legislative means is appropriate, we will bring forward the further amendments that need to be made, particularly to the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964.&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2012-02-06.54"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 February 2012; Vol. 735, c. 54</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/11">I welcome those comments. If the Government do have a clear strategy, I hope that the Minister will be able to make that clear and provide a road map and timetable for regulation. At the moment, it appears to the industry and those outside it that this might be policy on the hoof.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.0/1">My interest in this vital subject was sparked by the near-nightly chronicling of metal thefts in the black country by the excellent six-nights-a-week <i>Express and Star</i> newspaper, which is the most widely read regional paper in the country. As</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/2">the global price of metals such as lead and copper has climbed higher due to surging demand in emerging economies such as China, so the number of reports of metal thefts in local newspapers in my constituency has increased. Having studied the impact of this particular crime, and having set up with my friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> the all-party group on combating metal theft, it is my belief that most stolen metal is laundered within a few miles of where it is stolen. The most obvious reason for this is that the opportunist, unprofessional thief does not have the means, inclination or transportation to move several tonnes of stolen metal. Therefore, a car, pick-up truck or van-load of metal is usually weighed in at the nearest scrap yard that is known to pay cash with no questions asked.</p>

	<p pid="b.241.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that many of the vehicles that transport stolen metal have been filled with red diesel that was also stolen from the place where the metal was stolen, so it is actually a double theft?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.241.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" speakername="Chris Kelly" colnum="241"  time="020:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001629">
	<p pid="b.241.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. There is certainly a loss to the Exchequer and one often finds that the vehicles are uninsured and have no MOT. There is often criminality at all levels in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/2">I have a number of scrap yards in my constituency and there are many in the Dudley borough, the majority of which are run by law-abiding people who would not dream of laundering stolen metal for cash. I have visited one such dealer, Hudsons of Dudley in Brierley Hill, to see how the legitimate side of the trade operates. However, I suspect that the concentration of metal dealers in the Dudley borough and the black country has made my constituency and neighbouring constituencies a metal theft hot spot.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/3">Legitimate metal dealers have told me that yards they know of are regularly visited by youths carrying bags&#8212;often sports bags or even supermarket carrier bags&#8212;containing copper wire that is promptly weighed in for cash. I have even been told of a metal dealer&#8217;s customer record book containing the name Mickey Mouse and the address Disneyland, Paris. That reinforces my view that metal is usually sold within a few miles of where it has been stolen. A youth carrying copper wire in a plastic bag to a scrap yard clearly is not a professional, licensed or regulated commodity dealer who is monitoring the market, moving stock and options around, buying when the price falls, selling when the price rises and transporting metal between supplier and customer in liveried, professional fleets of vans and trucks. That is not to say that everybody who sells small quantities of metal for cash on a regular basis is handling stolen goods, but it is clear from police reports, infrastructure, energy and transport networks and insurance company records that much of it is stolen.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/4">The problem of metal theft was becoming so acute in my community that last February I arranged for the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40466" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)</phrase>, to meet a delegation of metal dealers and business people from the black country. They came down to the House to meet the Minister and</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/5">his officials to discuss measures to combat metal theft, and Mr Hudson of the aforementioned Hudsons of Dudley was one of the business men present. One of the problems we discussed with the Minister was that a legitimate metal dealer cannot compete with the cash-in-hand payment of a dealer who is prepared to launder stolen metal. A legitimate dealer paying the market price and declaring everything to the tax authorities cannot compete with a dealer who is prepared to pay cash and who does not declare all that he or she should to the relevant authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/6">It seems to me that there are only two reasons for wanting cash payments in business. The first is that one is prepared to launder stolen goods, with the cash rendering the seller untraceable, and the second is that one wishes to avoid the all-seeing eyes of Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. In some cases, it may be both. I know from my time in business that the use of cash is actively discouraged today. There are sensible but quite onerous reporting requirements in place to prevent money laundering and tax evasion by companies. There is also a massive security risk while the cash is on the company&#8217;s premises&#8212;typically an ordinary office and not a bank-like building with all the necessary security features&#8212;and while the cash is being transported in the footwell or boot of, say, a company car and then on foot from the parking bay to the local high street bank to be paid in. It is high time that this industry was modernised and properly regulated. I am a natural deregulator, but this is one industry for which, as the Home Secretary said in her written statement last week:</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/7">&#8220;Cash transactions&#8230;are often completed without any proof of personal identification or proof that the individual legitimately owns the metal being sold. This leads to anonymous, low-risk transactions for those individuals who steal metal. In addition, the widespread use of cash facilitates poor record keeping by the metal recycling industry and can support tax evasion activity.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2012-01-26.26"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 January 2012; Vol. 539, c. 26WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/8">Having spoken out several times about metal theft, I have received representations from the British Metals Recycling Association, which appears to make the sole argument that eliminating cash from the metal trade will drive the illegal trade underground. First, I would hope that no members of an organisation such as the BMRA would knowingly be involved in laundering metal above ground. Once stolen metal enters the chain of supply it is hard, if not impossible, to trace, and once it has been melted down it is virtually impossible to trace. That is why it must be prevented from entering in the first place through measures such as those we are calling for in the motion. Large metal recyclers cannot verify the source of every ounce of metal they process, and stolen material is undoubtedly laundered lower down the chain, ending up in domestic use or being exported to fast-emerging markets abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/9">Secondly, there will always be a small minority of rogue traders willing to launder stolen metal. The Government&#8217;s recent actions will not completely eliminate metal theft&#8212;hence the need to go further and faster, as we have called for in our motion&#8212;but I confidently predict that outlawing the use of cash will do much to reduce dramatically instances of this particular crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.0/1">May I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> on the way he introduced</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/2">the debate and on the lead he has shown on this important issue? I congratulate also the other authors of the excellent motion we are debating. This is an important time for tackling this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/3">I start my brief remarks by congratulating the Government and agreeing with them on some of what they are doing. I agreed with the Home Secretary when she said last month that people who deal in stolen metal are criminals &#8220;pure and simple.&#8221; Yes, they are. I also agree with the crime prevention Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40466" name="James Brokenshire">the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)</phrase> when he said last year that metal theft is not &#8220;a victimless crime.&#8221; No, it is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/4">My constituents would agree with both those statements, particularly if they use the east coast rail line, where cable theft seriously disrupts services at least once a week. Tynemouth residents would agree too, because they are angry when war memorials are vandalised or cowardly thieves steal commemorative plaques from seafront benches. They ask why it is taking such a long time to get to the right place on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/5">The Government sometimes stand accused, particularly by Opposition Members, of going too far, too fast, but on this issue they are not going far or fast enough. For example, when the pilot scheme to tackle metal theft in the north-east was announced&#8212;Operation Tornado&#8212;I sincerely welcomed and supported it, but there was an earlier pilot, Operation Fragment, in 2009, and when I asked the Home Office in a parliamentary question whether any evaluation of that pilot had taken place since the election, the Government said that they were learning from previous operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/6">The Home Office then announced a metal theft taskforce, which sounds very much like the metal theft unit in the Home Office that was disbanded. Yesterday in another place, the Government announced that they are considering legislative changes, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said, he has introduced a private Member&#8217;s Bill that is fit for purpose, so the Government need consider no further.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/7">It is baffling. Why has it taken so long to act? Was it because after the general election Home Office officials were told to disregard everything that had gone before and start a year zero policy? Has the Home Office, like the Justice Secretary, been convinced of the view that in a recession crime will inevitably go up? It did not go up during the 2008 recession and it does not have to be inevitable now. Alternatively, did the Home Office fail to see the link between commodity prices and theft and thus what was coming?</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/8">What can be done? Certainly cashless sales and increased fines will help, but the answer is not reform of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964, but its replacement. The police need real powers to enter scrap yards and to close premises if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.243.0/1">I am enjoying my hon. Friend&#8217;s speech immensely. I am sure that, like me, he goes on operations with his local police force, and if he has not done so, he should. I have sat outside a scrap yard in my constituency with police officers, observing the arrival of vehicle after vehicle that was known to the police. They know the criminals are there, but they are powerless to do anything. Does my hon. Friend share that view?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40619" speakername="Alan Campbell" colnum="244"  time="020:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001632">
	<p pid="b.244.0/1">Yes. It is important that we give the police powers to do something about that situation. If I was sitting outside a scrap yard in the circumstances my hon. Friend describes, I hope I should not just be there with police officers. I hope I would be there with people from the Department for Transport and the tax office. If people are breaking the law by illegally selling and buying scrap metal, they will be breaking other laws. It is important that officials work together in what used to be known as the Al Capone approach&#8212;if we cannot get them for scrap metal sales, get them for something else.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/2">We need to license scrap yards, which is important not simply to crack down on illegitimate dealers, but to protect legitimate businesses, because as we have heard, they are being dragged down by some of the practices elsewhere. Criminals must pay for their crime, not just through increased fines but by our making sure that when they are convicted, their assets are seized.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/3">The Government need to act quickly to get a grip on the problem. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said, they cannot even give a proper estimate of the cost to the public purse and to the community of metal theft. Figures vary from Deloitte&#8217;s estimate of &#163;220 million to &#163;770 million. That is a big gap and I am not sure even those figures give a proper view of the scale of what is going on. Nor can the Government say in how many cases assets are seized after conviction of the perpetrators.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/4">I shall be genuinely interested in hearing the Minister&#8217;s response. She is the fifth Minister in this Government to deal with the matter, so I hope she will bring focus and action. The answer is in the motion. I hope the Government accept the motion and that they implement it as soon as possible. They could make a good start by indicating this evening that they intend to take up the private Member&#8217;s Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.1/1">Metal theft has been a major issue in Derbyshire. Since October alone, more than 800 crimes have been reported. Fortunately, Derbyshire police have taken the issue to their heart. Operation Calanthia has led to 63 arrests and I am delighted to say that people have been arrested for the metal thefts in Smisby and Melbourne.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/2">However, it is not just my beloved Derbyshire that is suffering; the picture is much bigger, as we have already heard. The most interesting question is what we should do with metal dealers who make cash payments and say that they have robust recording arrangements. We really need to discuss what sort of licensing agreements there should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/3">We have good metal dealers in South Derbyshire. They run robust premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.2/1">As a former councillor, my hon. Friend will know that local authorities, which license alcohol and gambling, are perfectly set up to undertake licensing. I commend to her what is going on in north Lincolnshire where the police and the local council have been working together on a voluntary licensing scheme, which has considerably reduced metal theft over the last six months.</p>

	<p pid="b.245.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. There are voluntary agreements, but the difficulty is when cables have been stolen, or great big metal electricity boxes&#8212;substations. I do not know how on earth people manage to steal these things without anybody noticing.</p>

My whole home was trashed because thieves stole the boiler without turning off the water. Ordinary people are suffering and we demand that the Government take urgent action. People are fed up. There has been too much prevarication for too long.</p>

	<p pid="b.245.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but how do we have a robust licensing process that is not too onerous and expensive? Local authorities are the obvious people to do it, falling in line with alcohol licensing. That would fit really well. I do not want good professional firms to be penalised by more red tape and more cost, but they have to step up to the plate&#8212;no pun intended&#8212;and say that we need to clean up the whole process. It is not acceptable for everybody to turn a blind eye to the rogue dealers in all our areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.2/2">My hon. Friend talked about boiler theft. It is a most amazing new theft and I keep hearing about it. People are encouraged to put in new eco-boilers that are very green and efficient. Three months&#8217; later their houses are burgled and the boilers are taken. I suggested to the police that we ought to put identification numbers on boilers, but it would be a huge piece of new bureaucracy, so my good police came up with the suggestion of using SmartWater. It is a very good system, but will we really be putting SmartWater on every church roof? Will we put it on memorials? The situation is quite incredible. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> We shall to buy need shares in SmartWater.</p>

	<p pid="b.245.4/1">Absolutely right. One of the most robust statements by the Home Secretary was about her stance on this policy. We have had a green light to say that we have had enough. Our communities are up in arms, and people are suffering enormously. The cost to the taxpayer and communities is beyond the pale. I am delighted that this Back-Bench motion has been tabled, and I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s reply. South Derbyshire will be a better place when we finally get this sorted out.</p>

As Members will know, the iron bridge is in my constituency, so it is appropriate that I should speak. When I left yesterday,</p>

	<p pid="b.246.1/2">I have been contacted by the chairman of my police authority in West Mercia, who told me that there has been an alarming increase in the number of recorded metal theft offences. An additional 131 offences were recorded when comparing April to December 2011 to April to December 2010&#8212;a 12% rise&#8212;and those figures exclude the figures for the theft of catalytic converters, which have risen by 152%, and of lead flashings, which have shown a 92% rise.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.2/1">My hon. Friend mentioned catalytic converters, which reminds me of a case in Darlington. The owners of Bathroom World&#8212;bathroom fitters&#8212;had the catalytic converter stolen from their van, resulting in their being unable to fulfil orders and spending &#163;3,000 to replace a piece of metal that was worth just a couple of hundred pounds.

	<p pid="b.246.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We need to discuss the knock-on effects on businesses and on the wider economy this evening. She makes a valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/2">I understand that in West Mercia, recent offences have been committed at telephone base stations and national grid substations. The view of the police in our area is that the amount of metal being stolen shows that these crimes are being perpetrated by organised criminal gangs who are diverting their activity from other criminal arenas. They are using the cash environment for metal theft to fund other crime, which is extremely worrying. Cash generated by metal theft can be diverted into other crime, including organised crime. Those arrested often have previous history for distraction burglary and rogue trader offences. That organised component of criminal activity is significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/3">We have heard that the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 is no longer adequate for the modern day, and we need a licensing regime, as Members have said. I shall come on to that. Metal theft is dangerous. The British Transport police report a significant increase in cable theft, and</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/4">say that from April 2010 to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> there was a 70% increase in such theft. It is one of the biggest crimes that the railway industry has to deal with. It puts people&#8217;s lives at risk, and it costs the economy a fortune. In the Wales and Western BTP area, thefts, including attempted theft and malicious damage, rose from 369 in 2009 to 549 in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/5">As I said earlier, public buildings are being targeted, and we have all heard stories of churches and chapels being targeted for metal theft. I was listening to Radio 4 as I travelled down from Telford yesterday, and I heard about the issue that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40042" name="Mark Tami">the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami)</phrase> raised in an intervention. The loss that ecclesiastical insurers are willing to cover is &#163;5,000 on a church building&#8212;&#163;10,000 if an alarm is fitted to the roof. The problem, however, is that the scale of metal theft is enormous, and it costs tens of thousands of pounds to replace the metal stolen from church buildings. It is impossible to secure an entire building with an alarm system, so there is a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/6">I find it disheartening that people would want to steal from religious buildings, but it does not stop there. Some metal thieves really know how to plumb the depths. I said earlier that metal theft is not a new phenomenon, and my family has experience of that. A number of years ago, thieves stole a commemorative plaque relating to my wife&#8217;s parents from the crematorium in Shrewsbury. How low can someone go? They have to stoop pretty low to do that kind of thing, but some people are trying to stoop even lower. As we have heard, they are stealing metal from war memorials that commemorate people who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I will not give way again, because I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/7">I am pleased that steps have been taken to protect war memorials. SmartWater, which has been mentioned, is based in my constituency. The company is working to ensure that memorials are protected by using a water product to place a chemical signature on them. It is invisible to the naked eye, but it can be traced. However, as we have heard, it cannot be put on everything. It can be put on certain artefacts, and it can be used internally in buildings. People can also buy it to use in their home.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.3/8">We have to get rid of the cash environment for metal. We have to make sure that people process sales through cheques, BACS or other credit systems, and we need a more robust licensing regime. Banning cash transactions on its own will not be enough. We need better licensing arrangements to tackle metal theft. We need tougher police powers. The police need the capacity to go into scrap metal dealers&#8217; yards, inspect the premises under the licensing regime, and tally off sales, matching what has been spent with payments to people coming in. It is really important, and the Government need to act.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" speakername="John Leech" colnum="248"  time="020:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001647">
	<p pid="b.248.0/1">I would like to start by congratulating the hon. Members for Hyndburn (Graham Jones), for Dudley South (Chris Kelly), for Worcester (Mr Walker) and for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) on securing this Backbench Business debate on a subject that undoubtedly has an impact on constituents of every Member of the House. The scale of metal theft has rocketed in recent years as the price of scrap metal has risen. For example, the price of copper has risen by more than 200% since the end of 2008, and by more than 400% since 1997, so the incentive to steal it has increased significantly over the past 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/2">The problem is most acute on the railways. In 2010-11, 35,000 rail services were either cancelled or delayed as a result, at a cost of over &#163;16 million. Theft has cost Network Rail &#163;43 million in the past three years, and the Association of Train Operating Companies estimates that the knock-on effects cost the wider economy between &#163;16 million to &#163;20 million. However, the problem is certainly not confined to the railways. Churches, other religious buildings and monuments have become easy targets for thieves. Metal theft has cost churches in Manchester over &#163;1 million in the past five years, including in my own constituency, where the lead was stolen off the roof of one of the church buildings in Southern cemetery twice in one month. Since 2007 there have been 480 claims from the Anglican diocese, and Ecclesiastical Insurance, which covers the insurance of churches, paid out more than &#163;8.5 million in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/3">Local authorities and water companies fare no better. Thames Water estimates that metal theft costs it &#163;1.2 million each year, and Wessex Water claims that it has cost it &#163;1 million since 2010. Manhole cover theft costs North Somerset council &#163;40,000 a year and Newham council &#163;60,000 a year. In Manchester we have a particular problem with the theft of drain gully tops, so much so that they are now replaced by a non-metallic alternative. In fairness, the local council is quick to respond to reports of missing gully tops, but their theft is a real hazard to the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists, as gaping holes are created on the road next to the pavement.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/4">In November last year the Transport Committee undertook an inquiry into cable theft on the railways. Its conclusions were not altogether surprising:</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/5">&#8220;A key factor to the increase in cable theft is the ease with which illegally obtained copper cable can be sold on and laundered into the legitimate trade. The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 is inadequate to regulate the modern industry and reform of this legislation is necessary.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/6">Clearly the scrap metal trade is the weak link in efforts to combat metal theft crime. The Committee&#8217;s recommendations were not dissimilar to those put forward in the motion, and ultimately these additional steps might be required to finally bring about a reduction in scrap metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/7">However, there has already been a swift response from the Government. In November they provided &#163;5 million to establish a dedicated metal theft taskforce that will improve law enforcement on the illegal sale of scrap metals. Moreover, the Home Secretary laid a ministerial statement before Parliament only four days after the Transport Committee&#8217;s report was published. The statement proposed amending legislation and creating a new criminal offence to prohibit cash payments for</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/8">the purchase of scrap metal and to significantly increase the fines for all offences under the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964, which regulates the scrap metal industry. That will be done by amending the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.249.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> and other hon. Members on their work to secure this important debate on the epidemic of metal theft. In the short time available, I would like to concentrate on the work of the Transport Committee on its recent report on cable theft on the railways, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)</phrase> has already referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/2">Cable theft on the railways is an escalating problem of increasing importance. First, there is the disruption. Last year alone over 35,000 national rail services were cancelled or delayed, which meant 3.8 million passenger journeys thwarted. Secondly, it costs the public purse a great deal of money. Network Rail estimates that it has paid &#163;43 million out directly over the past three years, and there has perhaps been an additional &#163;20 million cost to the economy. Thirdly, lives are at risk. The British Transport police have said that 10 people lost their lives last year because of cable theft, and the problem is escalating.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/3">What is the solution? The solution lies in a package of measures. First, more preventative action is needed. Network Rail can do more to prevent theft by having better surveillance, burying cables, using alternative materials and using traceable technology marking such as RedWeb. There should be stricter licensing and regulation of scrap metal dealers and stronger enforcement of the conditions of that licensing; proof of identity for those selling metals at scrap metal dealers should be made compulsory; there should be better surveillance, including CCTV, when transactions take place; there should be records of those transactions; and cashless trading should be trialled.</p>

	<p pid="b.249.2/1">Much of that work can be done in conjunction with the police and local councils. The Localism Act 2011 gave new powers to those councils that are prepared to go the extra mile and implement procedures for some of that work, so some councils, such as Central Bedfordshire, are already doing some of that work. I accept that more needs to be done, but councils can go some way already.</p>

	<p pid="b.249.3/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her comments and recognise what she says, but the Committee advocates a compulsory system of registration, stronger licensing and enforcement, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.3/2">There must also be an increase in police powers to enter sites and to search them. There should be new offences, such as aggravated trespass on the railways, to make the theft of metal on the railway something for which thieves consider they will be apprehended. That requires more funding&#8212;more funding for British Transport</p>
	<p pid="b.249.3/3">police and for other authorities. Operation Tornado, which is being undertaken in the north-east of England, is to be welcomed, but it is a limited and voluntary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.3/4">This problem is not a new one. Back in 2008 the National Audit Office warned about the problem of metal theft, and during our inquiry we were told that the industry thought it was better to keep quiet about it. None of us will keep quiet about it any longer.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.3/5">I note and applaud the Government&#8217;s response following the publication of the Committee&#8217;s report, and some actions have now been taken, with others promised, but the full package of recommendations has not been adopted, so I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the Government intend to enact the full package of measures that the Committee proposed. We addressed the theft of cables on the railway, but our recommendations apply to the epidemic of metal theft wherever it may occur.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.0/1">I, too, congratulate those hon. Members who have managed to secure this debate. It is an incredibly important issue and, as many Members have said, a big scourge throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/2">I also voice my gratitude to the Home Secretary for announcing a couple of weeks ago the end of cash payments in scrap metal yards. It is testament to how seriously the Government take the issue that they are doing something fairly constitutionally important, which is to introduce a law that prevents an entire section of society using legal tender. This is a very welcome move, but we should not forget that important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/3">Last week I met the Wyre Forest Safety Partnership, which includes the police, and talked about how we can best help them. It is worth bearing in mind that there are plenty of laws available to prevent the scourge; it is just a question of helping the police to gather more evidence in order to implement the law and to effect more prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.1/1">In South Staffordshire my local district council has worked closely with the police to crack down on those who collect scrap metal, and it has found an exceptionally large number of vehicles that are not MOT&#8217;d, not insured and should not be allowed on the road at all. Is that something on which other district councils need to follow suit?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.250.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" speakername="Mark Garnier" colnum="250"  time="020:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0003.htm#12020793001654">
	<p pid="b.250.2/1">I am grateful for that intervention. Not only are a lot of dealers not insured, but many are not even licensed, and one suggestion from the police in order to deal with the problem is to license those scrap metal merchants who used to be the rag and bone men with whom we will be familiar thanks to &#8220;Steptoe and Son&#8221;, but who are now more technically minded and have flatbed trucks. So licensing is another measure that could be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/2">In our talks, the police came up with a number of ideas, and they have been successful locally in Wyre Forest. After seeing 60 offences last March, they managed to get the number down to 17 in November, but I shall give the House a flavour of the anomalies that they</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/3">mentioned, and discuss some of the ways in which we can help them to gather evidence in order to effect prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/4">An anomaly that I found surprising is that the police are allowed to visit licensed scrap metal yards, but need a warrant to visit unlicensed yards. I was not aware that there were unlicensed yards, but apparently there are. That situation favours the unlicensed premises, which is ridiculous. We definitely need to do something about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/5">The police would like an absolute offence of possession. One problem is that a scrap yard might have a pile of manhole covers, but the owner can say, &#8220;A lorry came in, weighed in, unloaded and weighed out, and I paid them for the scrap difference, not having seen the manhole covers that were hidden at the bottom of the lorry.&#8221; That is a reasonable defence, apparently. The police would like the law to be changed so that the possession of stolen goods&#8212;clearly, manhole covers will probably be stolen&#8212;is an offence in itself. That would put the onus on the scrap metal merchant to explore the contents of the load, rather than just check its weight. That is incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" name="Chris Kelly">the Member for Dudley South (Chris Kelly)</phrase>, who I think has slipped off to get a cup of coffee, mentioned the walk-in trade. It is one thing to be able to photograph vans and their licence plates when they come in. It is another thing when youngsters come in, perhaps saying that they are apprentice electricians, with bags of copper wire, because there will be no record. A ban on walk-in trade would be incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/7">Finally, there is the concept of specialisation. There are two sides to this argument. The first, which the British Metals Recycling Association pointed out when I met it a couple of weeks ago, is that some large companies that have a lot of scrap metal, such as utility companies and Network Rail, deal with 500 or 600 organisations to dispose of their scrap. If they were to limit that to just a handful of organisations, we would know, if rail track were found in a yard that was not a specialist rail disposal yard, that it was stolen. Similarly, the police suggest that some yards might want to specialise in certain areas, so that people know that they will deal only in cable, for example. That is an idea. I am not sure that it is workable, but I certainly think that it should be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.2/8">Clearly, this is a big problem and a lot of people are keen to sort it out. The sooner we deal with it, the better.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his tenacious approach to this issue from the outset. I was a sponsor of his ten-minute rule Bill in November; he has not rested on his laurels since.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/2">As colleagues have said in this debate and in previous exchanges, there has been a huge increase in the theft of cable and other metals. The exponential rise in thefts requires an equally robust legislative response, which the Government should be pushing through, but instead they are trying to catch up with the momentum given to this issue by Opposition Members. Although legislation</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/3">will not stop all such crime&#8212;it never does&#8212;it would make it more difficult for criminals to profit from their ill-gotten gains and make it easier to track and prosecute those responsible. Nobody should be in any doubt that the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 needs to be updated. We did not have things such as CCTV and SmartWater technology back then.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.0/4">As we have heard, metal theft is not simply a matter of the illegal sale of stolen scrap; its consequences can have profound knock-on effects. Without a tougher regulatory framework, trains will continue to face disruption because of missing signalling gears and cables, electricity supplies will be interrupted because of the theft of power lines, and our heritage will be poorer because of the vandalism of plaques and war memorials.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.1/1">No, I will make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/2">Even some of our churches have been hit by metal thieves. The stripping of a few hundred quid&#8217;s worth of lead has resulted in many thousands of pounds&#8217; worth of damage to the building&#8217;s structure. Some churches have actually closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/3">This is a serious crime that requires Members to produce a serious and viable solution that increases police power but safeguards legitimate, socially responsible scrap metal firms from financial restriction. We must do all in our power to clamp down on rogue dealers and metal laundering. Unless the Government agree to introduce a form of licensing for metal dealers and insist that anyone producing scrap metal must produce photographic identification, their limited response to a growing problem will be seen as no more than a sop. They need to grant the police and magistrates powers, which must be combined with vehicle badging for mobile scrap metal dealers. Trends suggest that without those necessary safeguards, the problem will continue to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/4">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase> said, not every dealer in the scrap metal industry is a Steptoe and Son-esque, turn-a-blind-eye fly-by-night. The industry provides a service that is both environmentally friendly in recycling terms and economically beneficial to UK plc. It is estimated that it contributes &#163;5 billion a year to the UK economy, with much of that figure coming from small firms. Our plans would restore confidence and make it a better-regulated business. I firmly believe that there has to be a stronger law enforcement mechanism and regulatory framework in place, so I urge colleagues of all parties to support the motion.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.2/1">I am pleased to be able to speak in this timely debate about a problem that has become endemic, and I am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for finding time for it to be held so quickly. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" name="Chris Kelly">the Member for Dudley South (Chris Kelly)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase>, and to the noble Lord Faulkner of Worcester, who has done much to advance the cause of better regulation of the sector. It is good that we have been able to work together on a cross-party basis, and in keeping with that approach I echo the praise we have heard from throughout the</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/2">House for the Government&#8217;s swift action to ban cash payments. However, I wish to make it clear that Members feel that we need to see more.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/3">I need not list the endless disruptions, expenses and outrages that we have seen across the country, because other Members have already done a very good job of doing so. I merely point out a few local examples to add to that catalogue. Last year saw a brazen attempt to steal metal in daylight from the roof of Worcester cathedral, at the very heart of my constituency; a number of long delays on the train lines that link us to London and Birmingham; and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40601" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> pointed out, a huge rise in metal theft reported to West Mercia police. Only today there are reports from the north of the county, in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase>, of major flooding caused by metal theft after thieves broke into a building and stole just &#163;6-worth of copper piping but left a trail of destruction in their wake. That is a fine example of how the costs of the crime can far outweigh its returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/4">No area has been safe from this crime. In a quiet residential square at the heart of Worcester, Britannia square, where for many years my grandmother lived in a nursing home, every front door was attacked and every door knocker removed in an opportunistic bout of metal theft.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.0/1">One category of theft that has not been mentioned so far in the debate is the theft of gold. That is a particular problem for the Asian community in Leicester and the Bangladeshi community in my constituency of Loughborough. It backs up the point that metal theft is not a victimless crime, because people are having their homes broken into and precious items that cannot be replaced stolen.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.1/1">Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. It is not a victimless crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/2">The many utilities, train companies, councils and other organisations that have given evidence to the all-party group have all been clear that they do what they can to improve security and mark their property, but there is simply no way to secure all the metal at risk from theft and police every part of the network of which it forms part. Likewise, residents and constituents who might have taken every effort to secure their home and its contents cannot secure the metal fittings on the outside of their home or the lead on their roof in the same way. That is why it was so vital for the Government to act fast to ban cash payments, and I welcome the move to do so through amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/3">I am particularly grateful that the noble Lord Henley has agreed to meet the all-party group, and it is positive that even ahead of doing so he has taken action on one of our main points. Quite apart from the main benefit of closing down the prime channel for metal thieves to dispose of their goods easily, as the hon. Member for Hyndburn pointed out, there is also potential for huge savings to the Treasury by closing down one of the main ways in which some scrap metal dealers have avoided paying VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/4">However, there is considerable concern that a straight ban on cash payments, in the absence of better regulation of the industry, could lead to an increase in black market metal recycling. The industry bodies have made it clear that they feel a proper licensing regime is needed, as have local legitimate scrap metal dealers who have spoken to me. That would protect the good businesses that go to great lengths to check that the source of their metal is legitimate, and ensure that those who failed to do so were put out of business.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/5">It is right, too, that metal theft should be made a specific crime in its own right and it is reasonable, given the many additional problems that it can cause&#8212;not least danger of death&#8212;that there should be a significantly higher penalty for metal theft than for other thefts. Energy companies have provided a number of examples to the all-party group of power exchanges being attacked, and in Worcestershire gas heating systems for swimming pools were attacked, and had that not been swiftly discovered and repaired it could have resulted in horrific or deadly injuries to innocent passers by. The group estimates that the number of deaths already caused by metal theft stood at around six last year, but the total number could be much higher. This is a crime that, quite apart from its enormous economic costs, has literally been killing people.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/6">I am therefore grateful to the hon. Member for Hyndburn for setting out in the motion a comprehensive list of measures to deal with the issue that speak for themselves as a comprehensive, common-sense approach to regulating the industry. Having discussed them with police officers, councillors and scrap metal businesses, I am confident that they can be implemented in a way that works.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/7">It would be wrong to pretend that the police have no powers to deal with metal theft already and I pay tribute to the excellent work of West Mercia police in Worcester in targeting this crime and recognise that they have succeeded in a number of instances, most recently making arrests, seizing stolen goods and &#163;3,000 in cash while closing down an illegal scrap metal merchant in a targeted operation last week.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.1/8">Today&#8217;s debate is urgent as we can do more on this issue. It is an example of Parliament working as it should, addressing an urgent problem through cross-party action and a co-ordinated effort through representatives in both Chambers. I congratulate the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate so far and welcome the decisive action that the Government have already taken, but I urge the Minister to consider carefully the well-researched and detailed recommendations in today&#8217;s motion as well as the support for them from so many in industry, in transport and in the vital utilities that keep our country going. The economics of metal theft have changed, making it more attractive for people to take a risk and break the law. It is up to this House and this Government to change the equation and put an end to the rise of this crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.254.0/1">I support today&#8217;s motion, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Dudley South (Chris Kelly), for Worcester (Mr Walker) and for Peterborough (Mr Jackson). It acknowledges that the comprehensive package of measures needed to address the issue is not being introduced at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/2">Those measures, documented in the motion, are many. It is clear from the motion that Back Benchers in the House do not believe that the Government are doing anywhere near enough to deal with this issue. Metal theft is reaching all-time new heights. In my constituency, as reported in <i>Coastal View </i>and the <i>Evening Gazette</i>, St Leonard&#8217;s Church of England parish church in Loftus has had lead stolen from its roof recently, and St Agnes&#8217;s Church of England parish church in the Easterside area of Middlesbrough has suffered a similar fate, with copper foil being lifted only this weekend. In 2010-11, the Church of England estate alone suffered &#163;4.5 million-worth of theft and vandalism. In St Agnes&#8217;s case, the cost of replacing the copper stolen from the church roof could cost as much as &#163;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/3">Cable theft is also hampering our infrastructure capability. Since 2009-10, when there were 1,593 incidents of cable theft, there has been a huge increase to 2,712 incidents. In the north-east, cable theft has almost doubled from 593 incidents in 2009-10 to 1,087 in 2010-11. Although the Government&#8217;s proposals to end cash payments and increase the fines are welcome, they are only part of what is required. On its own, the ending of cash payments only displaces the problem. In fact the Government can rightly be accused of having good intentions while the breeding ground for further black market activity increases because proper follow-through is not delivered through other measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/4">Without other measures, such as those proposed in the motion, yards can simply continue to trade in illegally gotten metals. Without adequate legislation for police entry on site, police force numbers, UK Border Agency funding and staff, vehicle badging and a proper national task force, the black market activity in metal theft will persist. Unfortunately, that already happens with vehicles and allows the mobile black market industry to thrive in industrial estates and car parks. Meanwhile, churches, war memorials, rail track, communication cable and industry are picking up the costs. I ask the Minister, is this a question of cost? For me, the real cost of increasing crime, with its consequences for my constituents, is the fact that they will continue to incur higher costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/5">More importantly, we need to support legitimate businesses that deal in surplus metals. By not acting, the Government are undermining legitimate businesses. Power cuts, commuter delays, industrial delays and church war memorial desecration are not acceptable and it is now time for the Government to govern, rather than passing the buck, before it is too late.</p>

	<p pid="b.255.0/1">I welcome today&#8217;s debate and commend the Members who were responsible for securing it. I want to highlight the scale of the problem in Pendle, where losses from metal theft have risen sharply in recent years. The impact of metal theft, as many Members have said, is not restricted just to the railways, although they are the main victims of the crime. In my area of East Lancashire, in particular, it is having a real and acute effect on smaller businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/2">In Pendle, metal theft has become a major concern of the local council and police. They have both told me that it is now one of their top priorities. The leader of the borough council, Councillor Mike Blomeley, wrote</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/3">to the Secretary of State in November to describe the problems that we were having in Pendle and call for a ban on cash payments. I am pleased that the Government have announced that that will happen. Councillor Blomeley wants the criminal justice system to focus on the impact of the crimes on individuals and communities, not the value of the metal stolen. I am sure that many other hon. Members would agree that that is the most appropriate approach, particularly given how all our communities have suffered due to metal theft. We have heard from several Members about theft from war memorials and other sites of particular interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.256.0/1">While my hon. Friend is discussing war memorials, I want to place on record the fact that last July in Hull, East Yorkshire, we lost a 6-foot bronze statue, a memorial to dead fishermen&#8212;trawlermen who lost their lives at sea&#8212;given by the people of Vik in Iceland. Does he share my disgust at that and similar thefts?</p>

	<p pid="b.256.1/1">I share my hon. Friend&#8217;s disgust. It is a classic example of some of the disgraceful incidents that have happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/2">In Pendle, historic churches such as St Mary&#8217;s in Kelbrook have been stripped of lead. Boilers, pipes and outside taps have been ripped from both occupied and unoccupied homes. Some businesses that have been targeted are now struggling to cope, putting many jobs at risk. The head teacher of Barrowford primary school told me just today that it cost more than &#163;60,000 to repair the damage caused by lead theft from the school roof. Another example is the town of Colne, where I live. The theft of metal grate covers from back streets has been so great that the Colne area committee has had to allocate a special budget of &#163;5,000 to replace them.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/3">According to figures made available to me by Lancashire police, there were about 2,228 metal theft crimes in Lancashire in 2010 and about 3,400 last year, representing a 50% year-on-year increase. In the whole of 2006, there were only 508 offences. That is a fivefold increase in five years. Lancashire police think that &#163;7 million is a conservative estimate of the value of metal stolen since 2006 and tell me that currently only 13% of offences are detected. Lancashire constabulary confirms that the rise in offending is consistent with the rise in metal prices, especially copper. Officers who have spoken to me feel hampered in identifying stolen metal and frustrated by the light sentences received by offenders who are caught.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/4">An ongoing police operation, Operation Starling, is addressing metal theft in Lancashire. However, the problem is now so significant that it is having a big effect on local crime statistics. Despite a good record on most fronts, the huge increase in metal thefts in East Lancashire makes it look as though the police force are actually doing badly. That is not the case. They are doing a great job, but they need Government support to tackle metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/5">I will briefly highlight the case of one of my constituents, a local businessman in Colne who has been the victim of metal theft in the past two years. He estimates the losses to his business in the past 24 months at around &#163;100,000. He has been targeted repeatedly. Everything from lead on the roofs to electric cabling inside properties</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/6">has been stolen. One gang, spotting a &#8220;for sale&#8221; sign, hit one of his buildings over a bank holiday weekend, taking so much metal that the building, with 80,000 square feet of commercial space, will now have to be demolished.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.1/7">My constituent attributes the crimes to the increase in metal prices, which we all know are expected to rise even higher in the coming months. He supports the Government&#8217;s ban on cash payments and the other steps that we are taking, and thinks that we should consider other measures. I pass to the Minister his suggestion that the Government consider the old 715 vouchers that we used in construction, where tax was paid up front but receipted so traders could claim it back. He feels that a similar scheme should be introduced for scrap metal dealers. The Minister might wish to consider my constituent&#8217;s suggestion along with the others that the Government are considering. I urge the Government to continue doing everything they can to support the police and councils in their efforts to tackle the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.0/2">I am sure that many legitimate yards and dealers take care to ensure that their supplies come from legal sources, but others are not so scrupulous and purchase from less-than-honest individuals. Dishonest scrap dealers encourage theft and provide an easy and quick way for thieves to dispose of stolen metal. It beggars belief that no checks are made and no proof of ownership requested. I believe that these dealers create the market for dishonestly obtained metal.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.0/3">Nowhere is safe. We have heard about war memorials, church plaques and pieces of metal around and about buildings. They are stolen regularly and monotonously, causing much grief and anger. Many people will recall a news story in the Swansea area where every brass instrument of a well-known local brass brand was stolen. Within hours, each instrument had been paid for and processed by a local dealer. It was all caught on CCTV and had been done from the back of the thieves&#8217; van. What did the poor brass band get back? They got a big lump of squashed metal. Where did the dealer think that this metal had come from? Cable theft has become a big problem in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a massive problem with cable theft from the Welsh train service? In my constituency, on the Ebbw Vale to Cardiff railway line, there have been terrible delays for commuters. We need to stop this expensive crime, which has such a corrosive effect and prevents people from getting to work.</p>

	<p pid="b.257.2/1">Certainly. I will refer to that later.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/2">Cable theft has grown. My own office was struck twice just before Christmas, which was of great inconvenience to me and my constituents. Those who have faced the disruption and reality of cable theft are aware of what people are going through. Last weekend, Morriston hospital, a large hospital in my constituency</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/3">providing services to people from across south Wales, experienced a breakdown in communication connectivity, resulting in a delay in transmitting essential information that I believe could even have put lives at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/4">Every power outage has a severe effect on our communities: ever-increasing numbers of households experiencing cuts in power, more travel delays, and community and recreational establishments unable to open to the public. Both Virgin Media and Network Rail, two of the best-known organisations in the UK, have experienced considerable disruption from cable theft in and around my constituency. In December alone, there were more than 50 metal thefts affecting cable services in Swansea East. Virgin Media has provided me with these figures, and they show a distinct pattern. Thefts took place every other week, with constituents along Neath road, which is a major thoroughfare that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will know quite well and which is a key access route into the city, experiencing severe disruption and inconvenience to their media and telephone services with monotonous regularity.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/5">Similarly, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40094" name="Nick Smith">the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)</phrase> alluded to, Network Rail has experienced huge levels of theft. This year alone, there have been 46 incidents, causing more than 22,000 minutes of delay, more inconvenience for travellers and businesses in the Swansea area and more costs for the company. On a UK level, metal and cable theft has caused more than 16,000 hours of passenger delays and cost the rail industry &#163;43 million in the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.257.2/6">It is clear to me and others that we need a much tougher licensing regime for dealers. We have to end this buying-at-the-back-door-mentality and require that anyone selling materials to scrap metal dealers prove their identity and provide documentation on where and when the metal was sourced. Local police are ever vigilant, and they are doing a fantastic job and are working within our communities to tackle this scourge. They have successfully prosecuted people, but I support calls to give them greater powers to investigate and prosecute. Enough is enough. This is an illegal practice that affects us all, and it cannot be allowed to continue. Action is needed and I appeal to the Government: it is needed sooner rather than later.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.0/1">I congratulate the Backbench Business Committee on securing this debate, and colleagues from all sides of the House on pushing this issue forward. We have heard many examples of what a terrible crime metal theft can be. I know that my constituents, among others, will be completely taken aback by how bad it can be, and by the mentality of someone who can steal a war memorial or a memorial from a park bench. One has to be a certain type of person to be able to commit such a crime. There are also examples of the crime that put the public at risk. They involve the theft of railway lines, telecommunications lines or electrical supply equipment.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.1/1">Another example, in agricultural areas, is where metal thieves nick gates, which is not only inconvenient, but has the knock-on effect of allowing</p>
	<p pid="b.258.1/2">cattle and horses to get out and cause damage. That costs money, the insurance premiums go up and it all causes massive disturbance.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. One cannot underestimate the potentially disastrous consequences of a herd of cattle wandering on to a railway line. Indeed, rural areas can find themselves particularly targeted. He mentioned agriculture, but rural churches have also been targeted, because they are so isolated and are not overlooked by other properties. Edwinstowe church in my constituency has had the lead removed from its roof seven times, which is simply outrageous.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/2">One way of dealing with the problem would be to improve the legislation. However, I would also encourage English Heritage to consider alternatives. English Heritage forces churches to replace the lead, but if we could find a fibreglass replacement that looks like lead, that would solve the problem and deter the thieves, because the value of fibreglass is zero. Indeed, not only have churches in my constituency been affected, but Newstead abbey, the home of Lord Byron, has been targeted, with its gutters and downrights stolen. Again, we are talking about an historic building, owned by the city council, which has taken the decision not to replace the gutters and downrights because it cannot protect the property in the short term. The council will have to leave that historic building in a poorer state of repair, which is an absolute tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/3">I am therefore happy to support the motion. I hope that the Government will take the firmest and strongest action. Not only do normal members of the public support that, but the scrap dealers I have talked to&#8212;the legitimate businesses&#8212;also want us to take action. I pay tribute to my constituent Edward Donnington, a local trader who has been constantly lobbying me to try to improve the way in which such trades are recorded. He is a registered scrap dealer who welcomes the Government&#8217;s intervention to try to resolve the issue, because his business has also been targeted. He has had people breaking into his yard to steal his lorry and take scrap from his premises. The legitimate scrap dealers are looking to us to take firm action and clamp down on those involved. The only way we can do that is to stop cash transactions and also to have photographic evidence of those who undertake transactions, so that they can be clearly identified at a later date if something goes wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/4">Before I finish, I want to mention what has been happening in Nottinghamshire. I pay tribute to Nottinghamshire county council trading standards and Nottinghamshire police, as they have taken the issue very seriously. They have put together a local group of all the relevant authorities, to take action and, more importantly, to inform each other about what is correct and what is not, because a normal bobby on the beat might not be aware of some of the relevant issues in those scrap yards. For instance, there is only one registered scrap dealer in Nottinghamshire who can deal in, as it were, railway steel, and only one who is registered to deal in telecommunications cable from British Telecom. If such cable is found in any scrap yard other than the one that is registered, it is clearly in the wrong place and a crime has been committed. It is all about informing</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/5">those authorities so that there is cross-information, as it were, and ensuring that when someone sees something out of line, they take firm action.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.0/6">I hope that this debate is a step in the right direction, and that the Government grab this issue and drive the frankly terrible people involved out of the industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.260.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Dudley South (Chris Kelly) and for Worcester (Mr Walker) and others on securing this debate. In the few minutes that I have, I should like to concentrate on one line in the motion, which calls for</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/2">&#8220;a radical change in how the scrap metal industry is regulated&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/3">We have heard a lot about the behaviour of the scrap metal man who goes round in his van, hawking and trying to get bits of scrap metal, and who is, as I mentioned in an earlier intervention, not averse to lifting anything that is not nailed down. Indeed, sometimes he goes so far as to rob roofs and memorials, and to commit other shameful acts.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/4">I want to focus on the scrap metal yards, and on one in particular. I would like to be able to say that it is dear to my heart, but it is quite the opposite. It epitomises the worst aspects of the industry, which we need to stamp out if we are to start to regulate it properly. The people who bought the yard put up two buildings in it, for which they had no planning permission. They built them 15 months ago, irrespective of any rules or regulations, to service the end-of-life processing of vehicles. They also put up CCTV columns. The yard abuts a large housing development; it is right behind people&#8217;s houses, and the 360 CCTV cameras can look into those homes. The owners also put up lighting columns that illuminate the yard late into the evening, seven days a week. This, too, was done without planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/5">The owners also built a wall. Regardless of the fact that the existing planning permission for the area allowed for a 2-metre high fence, they built a wall that was higher than that, so that they could pile the scrap higher. Such a fence was banned under the previous planning permission, which they have ignored. They have also built supports for the wall on council land that they do not even own.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/6">The most incredible thing that those people have done is something that they did quite recently. Residents in the area have understandably expressed concerns about the noise, dust and vibration pollution that they have to put up with. The noise is terrible; the crashing can be heard from a mile away. To get round the problem, the owners came up with a great wheeze. They constructed a wall of shipping containers, piled three high and welded together. And, yes, this was done without planning permission. Thankfully, the council managed to act quickly, and it issued a stop order that has another week to run.</p>

	<p pid="b.260.1/1">My hon. Friend is painting an appalling picture of one particular rogue operator.

The acting chief constable has raised the issue with me, and he told me</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/2">that it is the issue on which we in the House could do the most to support what he is trying to do to crack down on crime. Does my hon.

	<p pid="b.261.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. We need a complete review of everything relating to the scrap metal trade. We also need to bring in a really robust set of proposals quickly, if we are to eliminate these problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.0/2">The problem is one of identifying the rogue traders. The company in my constituency, European Metal Recycling, says that it is the biggest scrap metal firm in Europe. What a recommendation that is, if it behaves in such a way in my constituency and treats with shameful disdain anyone who lives within earshot of the site. The council got wind of the plan to put up the wall of shipping containers when the company started to prune some of the trees. When council officers went to the site to ask why that was happening, they were told, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a bit of routine pruning&#8221;&#8212;but, hey presto, a few days later, up went the shipping containers.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.0/3">Unfortunately, sorting out the rogues from the good guys is very difficult. We need a robust, detailed system that will cover all metal dealers: the folk who drive round our estates at all hours of the day and night calling for scrap metal; those who walk around with carrier bags full of metal that they have liberated from somewhere; and the supposedly large concerns that trade internationally in the metal that they process. We need a system that will do a proper job of clamping down to ensure that our communities are no longer blighted by this menace.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.1/1">I, too, congratulate the Members who have initiated this debate, which, as we can tell by the turnout in the House, is on a hugely important issue. Metal theft will not go away easily. Why? Because it is so worth doing. Some of the figures are quite staggering. While BT&#8217;s stock-market value is about &#163;15 billion, the estimated current value of the metal in its cables is &#163;50 billion. There are billions and billions of pounds worth of metal in our country, in some cases literally lying around&#8212;in the railways, for example. Thieves are now sawing down metal railings, and I recently canvassed a street in my constituency where all the drain covers had been stolen. Making the assets themselves secure is obviously impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/2">Because of the sums involved, the people engaged in this activity run all the way from petty thieves to organised crime. Just as in other organised crimes such as drug dealing, some of the big players will not do their own dirty work; others will be stealing to order for them. We all know that these crimes can cause massive costs and disruption. Recently visiting friends in a village in Oxfordshire, I could communicate only by text in the last two days before the visit because the village had been entirely cut off by the theft of telephone and internet cables.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/3">Shortly before I came into the Chamber this evening, a member of the House staff told me that Norwood library recently had its roof stolen and &#163;2 million-worth</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/4">of damage was done to books and computers as a result. We have heard other stories from other Members, so I shall not say much more about that. Such stories show that these crimes are far from victimless, as a single theft can impact thousands of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/5">I am vice-chairman of the all-party steel and metal recycling group, and in that role I recently visited two sites of European Metal Recycling, the largest metal recycler in Europe, which has 67 sites across the UK and employs 2,000 people. The notes for my speech state that this is a &#8220;highly reputable organisation&#8221;, but I might need to speak to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> about that. At its small site in Marske in my constituency, I saw many of the measures mentioned in the motion already in action&#8212;for example, documentation, video recording, photo and vehicle identification are routine and there are clear rules about how to check material. The original source might be a council as in the case of road signs or items might be labelled as BT equipment. At its large site in Hartlepool, I saw what a huge-scale operation, including car shredding, looks like.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/6">Companies like EMR support regulation. EMR says:</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/7">&#8220;All we ask is that the Government takes the necessary time to work with the industry to ensure that regulations are as tightly and effectively drawn as possible and that the necessary level of resource is committed to enforce rigorously once in place. We have had 20 years of increased regulation and poor enforcement in our industry. Without doing both of these things the legitimate industry will be harmed, the illegitimate thrive and there will be little or no impact on metal theft.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/8">Let me touch briefly on another area&#8212;prevention. All people with metal-related assets need to think more about how they can discourage theft. I have already mentioned BT&#8217;s franking of its equipment, but a lot more could be done. Energy companies, Network Rail and many others should look at how to make it easy for dealers and enforcement officers to spot stolen material. They must ensure that their legitimate scrap disposal routes are advertised to the industry so that anyone else receiving identifiable material knows that it is stolen. More questions must be asked about the source of the material, such as high voltage cables or transformer equipment. We must make it easy for people to report others that they see involved in this activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/9">We should not legislate for the sake of it, but we should ask the police what is necessary&#8212;and make the punishments fit the crime. It is time for action and I urge the House to support the motion.</p>

	<p pid="b.262.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> and other hon. Members who tabled the motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.0/2">Some members of the public have said that the current economic climate and the financial plight in which some individuals find themselves have led to the massive increase in metal theft that we are witnessing. Frankly, I find such a statement to be naive. There can be no excuse for theft at the current levels. I believe that across the House we are united in our determination that something should be done&#8212;and it should be done now. As we have heard this evening, the incidence of metal theft has soared throughout the country as metal prices have increased, and we all want the police to be given the powers that will enable them to tackle the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.0/3">The figures given by Members can leave us in no doubt that the amount that individuals are receiving for the stolen metal in their possession represents but a fraction of the cost of replacing it. The weekend before last, ScottishPower reported the theft of power cables from a farm near the town of Castle Douglas in my constituency. In such instances, not only are people put in danger because the cables carry thousands of volts of electricity, but misery is caused to communities and neighbourhoods that are left without power&#8212;sometimes for a number of hours&#8212;until repairs can be completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.0/4">I know that many other Members wish to speak, so I shall not repeat much of what has already been said. Let me merely emphasise the need to replace the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 and take immediate action to end cash transactions, especially large-scale high-value transactions. Anyone selling scrap metal must provide proof of identity, which must be recorded at the point of sale. We must give the police powers to enter premises and shut down rogue metal scrap yards, thereby protecting decent and legitimate dealers. There are such dealers out there, and they want the House of Commons to act. I also believe, as someone from north of the border, that the powers vested in the Scottish Government will enable it to act in conjunction with the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.263.2/1">I will try to observe your admonition, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.2/2">On behalf of the Church of England, I thank the Home Secretary and Ministers in the Home Office for what they are doing. For some time, tragically, lead has been stolen from the roofs of an average of some 10 churches a day. We have heard of many instances from Members this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.2/3">Whether such a theft is from a church in an inner-city parish or from a rural church, the devastation caused to the local community is enormous. For that reason, the churches and cathedrals division of the Church of England set up a working party which, over a period, took evidence and consulted a number of organisations including English Heritage, insurers, police forces throughout the country, and scrap metal merchants themselves. The working party concluded that the one measure that was needed above all was to take cash out of metal transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.2/4">Anne Sloman, who chairs the group, the Bishop of London and I went to see Ministers in the Home Office, and I think it should be put on the record that those Ministers listened and acted. I do not understand why Members suggested this evening that Ministers were slow. In my experience, Ministers often say &#8220;I understand what you mean, Baldry, and you have a very good point, but we shall have to wait for a legislative slot.&#8221; On this occasion, Home Office Ministers reached for the first Bill that passed by, which was the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. They said, &#8220;Look, we can get this into the long title of that</p>
	<p pid="b.263.2/5">Bill: we will table amendments immediately.&#8221; That is exactly what they did, and I think that they should be thanked for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.2/6">Let me say on behalf of the Church that we accept that additional measures may be necessary in due course. For example, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase> mentioned the need for warrants to go into unregulated yards. I understand that view, but I do not think the House should be unmindful of what Ministers have done in persuading colleagues in Whitehall to accept amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. Members should also not be unmindful of the fact that this will be the first ever commercial activity where cash is not allowed to be used&#8212;and, indeed, where using cash will be a criminal offence. Credit should be given where credit is due, and I therefore simply say, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.264.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" name="Chris Kelly">the Member for Dudley South (Chris Kelly)</phrase> said, this is an important debate because metal theft has been growing exponentially over the past several years. This issue is a national concern and also affects individuals and communities. I cannot believe that any of the UK&#8217;s 650 constituencies has not been affected in one way or another by the blight of metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/2">In 2011 in Crawley constituency there were 108 reported incidents of metal theft. However, the police tell me that that is, in fact, only a small fraction of the total number of such thefts, and I am sure they are right. There has been a range of different types of metal theft in my constituency, as I am sure is also the case throughout the country. In my constituency, eight schools and three churches had lead taken from their roofs in the last year. Such crimes are often only discovered when it rains several days later and the buildings concerned suffer a great deal of structural damage. Other types of theft include thefts of catalytic converters from garages and thefts from domestic dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/3">I pay tribute to my local police. Chief Inspector Steve Curry is in charge of Crawley police station, on behalf of Sussex Police. He has done a phenomenal job over the last year in reducing crime in my constituency. Dwelling burglaries have fallen by 25.8% over the last year, for instance. Unfortunately however, non-dwelling theft has increased by 25.7%, and much of that has been metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/4">Metal theft has a massive effect on the UK economy. Many of my constituents commute to London every day, and, sadly, it is not uncommon for the theft of cable, often miles away, to result in trains grinding to a halt across London and the south-east. I am not fishing for sympathy, but I have suffered from that myself. On a day when I was planning to get to Parliament very early as I had an early question on the Order Paper, I almost did not arrive on time.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/5">The cost of these thefts to our economy runs to many tens of millions of pounds, and I congratulate the Government both on their &#163;5 million investment in the taskforce to tackle this problem and, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said, on introducing amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/6">of Offenders Bill. The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 was written for a &#8220;Steptoe and Son&#8221; age. I therefore greatly welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to updating it for the sake of our constituents, the country and the economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.265.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" speakername="Julian Sturdy" colnum="265"  time="021:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001680">
	<p pid="b.265.0/1">As we have heard, the explosion of metal theft in recent years has affected churches, railways lines, war memorials and countless public sector buildings, ranging from schools to hospitals, up and down the country. Criminals are hitting our city centres as well as many rural villages, making this a truly national crime. The growing problem of metal theft is costing the British economy more than &#163;770 million a year, although the suspected number of unreported metal theft cases means that it could be argued that the overall cost to the economy is actually even higher. It is therefore right that the Government tackle this issue as a matter of urgency. As such, I am pleased to see that they are prohibiting the use of cash to pay for scrap metal. A cashless system will bring greater transparency to the scrap metal industry and will reduce the often anonymous transactions that enable criminals to sell on much of their stolen metal before disappearing without trace. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase>, I wish to use this opportunity to welcome the Government&#8217;s &#163;5 million funding, as outlined last November, to establish a dedicated metal theft taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/2">Although I commend the Government&#8217;s recent actions on this issue, I wish to focus the rest of my contribution on how we must now keep the momentum going. It would be foolish for us to believe that a cashless system alone will adequately stem the tide of metal theft. After all, as with all robust reforms, there is always a danger that clamping down on illegal activity within a specific sector will drive the activity further underground and into a deeper and more dangerous black market. So I urge Ministers to commit to a fundamental review of the situation in six months&#8217; time, when I believe that the Government&#8217;s timely reforms will have had time to take hold. It is imperative that we do not simply introduce such reforms and then sit back, because there is a real chance that the scale of the problem will require even more measures to be implemented in due course. For example, should the first draft of the robust reforms fail to cut it, will the Government also consider providing police officers with new powers to enter and inspect registered and non-registered scrap metal sites, as suggested by the Select Committee on Transport? Likewise, should metal theft be plunged into a deeper black market, will Ministers consider implementing the sensible measures proposed in today&#8217;s motion? I will not go into all of these radical suggestions in detail, but they could all play a vital role in a strong second phase of the fight against metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/3">I urge the ministerial team not to take their eye off the ball on this issue. Metal theft is a hugely expensive and disruptive crime, which has offered criminals a high return in recent years because of the rise in global commodity prices. After a suitable period of time I hope that the Secretary of State will update the House on progress and, if necessary, introduce further measures to penetrate the core of this damaging criminal activity, which cannot continue to go unchecked.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.266.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" speakername="Fiona Bruce" colnum="266"  time="021:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001681">
	<p pid="b.266.0/1">As a member of the all-party group on combating metal theft, which initiated this debate, I welcome and support the motion. We must address the widespread and growing problem of metal theft, and ensure that together we deliver a robust approach to fight this crime, which is blighting so many lives and communities. My constituent, the venerable Ian Bishop, Archdeacon of Macclesfield, asked me some time ago to highlight the issue in the House, and I am pleased that the Government are taking action to introduce a cashless payments system. They are perhaps doing so in no small part because of the number of questions that have been raised by those of us who attend questions to the Church Commissioners in this House&#8212;this is perhaps evidence of the worth of attending those questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/2">Ian Bishop has asked me to reiterate the concerns that he has expressed. Every Church of England church in my constituency has been hit by metal theft in the past four years, and that has had a seriously debilitating effect on both the financial stability and morale of churches. He recounts one minister sobbing on his shoulder following a metal theft. The insurance available to churches is wholly insufficient to offset the consequences of this crime. He explained it as follows today. Ecclesiastical Insurance, the major insurer of churches, can provide only &#163;5,000 of compensation for incidents of metal theft. In extreme cases, when the historic fabric of a church suffers water damage, the costs of repair easily exceed &#163;100,000, which means that churches are, in effect, uninsurable and left at the mercy of those who perpetrate these crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/3">Ian Bishop has also highlighted to me the &#8220;ludicrous position&#8221; of the Church Buildings Council and English Heritage being too slow to allow churches to use alternative materials on grade I listed buildings. Such an approach encourages metal theft to become a cyclical crime, with the criminals winning again. I feel another Church Commissioners question coming on.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/4">It is not only churches that suffer. In my constituency there has been a significant increase in the number of thefts of iron work from highways in the past 18 months&#8212;sometimes as many as 20 to 30 gullies a day. These are very expensive to replace, with installation costing &#163;300 to &#163;400 per gully, and the costs are paid by local council tax payers. Just last Saturday a constituent reported that on walking to my surgery he noticed the theft of metal posts that had been put in place to protect the public from falling into the canal at a risky point. That left a dangerous gap between the water and the popular walkway alongside the canal. It was reported to me today, on telephoning his home to check his account, that on his return from my surgery he noticed that the next set of posts had been stolen too.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/5">The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 needs to be updated. I, too, applaud the Government for their initiative in amending the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill and I thank Home Office Ministers for introducing the move towards cashless transactions. However, we also need changes to police powers to close unscrupulous scrap metal dealers and to give police the authority to search all premises owned and operated by scrap metal dealers. The police should be given the power to inspect any articles or records kept on site and there should be an ability to close dealerships.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/6">We need a move to a robust and compulsory licensing scheme to replace the present inadequate and outdated registration scheme. The use of CCTV should help. A comprehensive package of measures is needed to address this grave and far from victimless crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.267.2/1">There have been many disturbing instances in my constituency relating to metal theft. Just before Christmas, tenants had to be evacuated from their flats after a gas leak was discovered on an estate in Halesowen. Lives are clearly being put at risk by criminals stealing this metal. We know that most metal dealers take all appropriate steps to check the provenance of the scrap metal they are buying. Soon after I was elected, I toured the Mason Metals recycling centre in Halesowen. Mason Metals was working with Dudley police on &#8220;Scrap Yard Watch&#8221;, an appointment-driven collection scheme to help householders to dispose of large white goods legally and responsibly. It has now launched a new membership card programme for its customers. That scheme is in addition to the statutory waste transfer note records and is run alongside other measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.2/2">I very much welcome the Government&#8217;s announcement that cash transactions for scrap metal will be outlawed. I understand the concerns voiced by legitimate metal recyclers, but the growing problem of metal thefts cannot be tackled effectively without proper traceability. We also need tougher penalties for those who are caught and convicted so that punishments are more proportionate to the scale of the crime. A &#163;1,000 fine is hardly a deterrent for the unscrupulous minority. The Home Secretary has said that sentences will be significantly increased, which is very good news. Scrap metal dealers who offer a market for stolen metal, whether knowingly or by failing to carry out adequate checks&#8212;</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40619" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr Campbell)</phrase> reminded us, this has been an emerging and long-standing problem. Indeed, Operation Fragment, which he commenced when he was at the Home Office, when I had the privilege of sharing an office with him at that Department, was an important effort in developing</p>
	<p pid="b.267.4/3">a programme to tackle metal theft at the end of the previous Government. Sadly, the problem has increased in that time, although this is not the fault of the current Government. About 15,000 tonnes of metal are stolen each year, with as much as half of that being stolen from scrap metal dealers themselves, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40530" name="Mark Spencer">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer)</phrase> mentioned. Industry and commercial victims agree that the figure is an underestimate. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the hon. Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase> has said, there is still a significant problem with metal theft across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.4/4">There is a particular problem with churches, as was mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop) and for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram) and the hon. Members for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler), for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) and for Banbury (Tony Baldry): 2011 was the worst year on record for the number of metal thefts from churches, with more than 2,500 claims. The problem of insurance has been drawn to the attention of the House today.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.0/1">In Bournemouth, we find that it is not just individuals who steal metal but organised groups. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that we need to legislate not just against individuals but against those who organise the crime?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.268.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="268"  time="021:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001688">
	<p pid="b.268.1/1">Serious organised crime as well as opportunistic individuals are behind metal theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/2">Cable theft caused the delay or cancellation of more than 35,000 national rail services, with more than 365,000 minutes of delay and a &#163;16 million bill. Those points were made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" name="Louise Ellman">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman)</phrase>. Her Committee&#8217;s report highlighted them particularly, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase> has played a role in raising the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/3">Every day, there are eight actual or attempted thefts on railways. I was particularly struck by the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40475" name="Andrew Stephenson">the hon. Member for Pendle (Andrew Stephenson)</phrase>, who illustrated the impact of metal theft on small businesses in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/4">Over the past year, 10 people have been killed in metal theft incidents. The gas leak referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40291" name="James Morris">the hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris)</phrase> was an extremely important incident. The Association of Chief Police Officers has estimated that metal theft costs the UK about &#163;770 million a year, a figure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" name="Julian Sturdy">the hon. Member for York Outer (Julian Sturdy)</phrase> mentioned, and which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40601" name="David Wright">the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> showed has been rising over the past few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/5">I am most struck by the despicable nature of the crime. In his contribution, the hon. Member for Worcester said that door-knockers had been stolen from old people&#8217;s homes. People have talked about war memorials. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">The hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> spoke about the theft of a memorial in the city of Hull for fishermen lost at sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/6">These crimes are committed by people who do not respect their neighbours, their communities or the people who live in them, so I welcome the fact that the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/7">have acted to tackle metal theft head-on, but I genuinely say to the House that they need to go much further. I welcome the proposals to end cashless payments, as did the hon. Members for Congleton and for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier). The proposals to increase fines are welcome too, but that is only part of what is required. The motion today, and its support from Members, has indicated that the House agrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/8">I worry that the situation could be made worse by the amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill that Lord Henley has indicated he will table on Report, which is likely to take place next month. Banning cash transactions, while positive, will not of itself solve the problem. Legitimate scrap yards will go cashless, but some yards, as has been said, will continue to take cash and to operate a black market. Only yesterday evening in the other place, my noble Friend Lord Rosser tabled an amendment that would give the police greater powers of entry and to shut down rogue scrap metal yards&#8212;measures welcomed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40596" name="Sin James">the Member for Swansea East (Mrs James)</phrase> and others. Those proposals are in the motion and were welcomed by Members this evening, yet the vote last night&#8212;for vote there was, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;was lost by six.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/9">Lord Henley argued against the amendment, but he should read the debate we have held today. The feeling on both sides of the House is that it is an important proposal, so he needs to revisit it when he and his officials draft amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown)</phrase> said, and as Lord Henley himself said last night, the 1964 Act is &#8220;beyond its sell-by date.&#8221; It was designed for the time of Steptoe and Son, not for the multifaceted organised criminals and opportunists of today. Lord Henley said:</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/10">&#8220;We wish to see a reform to that Act as soon as is possible, and we will make sure that we do it&#8230;We are looking for a coherent package of measures to tackle metal theft.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2012-02-06.52"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 February 2012; Vol. 735, c. 52-4</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/11">Let me be presumptuous and recommend that Lord Henley look at the motion in detail. I commend the suggestions of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> on tackling metal theft. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase> mentioned, those who follow best practice already do the things that the motion suggests.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/12">My right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford has introduced proposals to tackle metal theft, and that plan is supported by the British Transport police, the Association of Chief Police Officers, Neighbourhood Watch, BT, E.ON, energy networks, and Network Rail, to name but a few. It includes powers of entry for police, and tougher powers for them to close down rogue traders&#8212;a proposal that has been welcomed tonight across the board. It means that anyone selling scrap has to provide proof of identity, which will be recorded at the point of sale&#8212;again, that has been welcomed tonight across the board. It includes licensing scrap metal dealers, rather than the current system of registration with local authorities. It means, yes, doing what the Government say they are doing&#8212; banning cash transactions, especially for large-scale, high-value scrap metal transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/13">Those measures will allow legitimate trade to continue, which is what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> wants, but, by our making it harder and more expensive for opportunists and organised criminals to profit from metal theft, the cowboy traders that he mentioned will feel the burden of those measures very strongly. Prevention can play an important part. Private sector solutions such as SmartWater, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Telford, are important. Other suggestions, such as the one made by the hon. Member for Sherwood, for alternatives to lead, are valuable, and can be looked at by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/14">We cannot, however, get away from the fact the House has spoken with one voice, and it wants the changes proposed in the motion. The Opposition support those measures, and I want the Minister to support them too. We need a much tougher licensing regime, and we must ensure that we require people to do the things that I have outlined so that we can stop extensive metal theft. The Minister will say that she certainly supports the banning of cash transactions. She will say that she supports increased fines, but if she says that she does not support the other measures in the motion she must explain to the House and to her hon. Friends why not, and why she will not undertake those actions. From my perspective&#8212;and I think that I speak for most Members who have spoken tonight, not on a party political basis, but on a House of Commons against the Government basis&#8212;those are important measures that we want collectively, across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/15">The motion was drafted by the all-party group, with support from every party. It has the support of every Member who has spoken tonight. Time is pressing, and we need to do this. Households face power cuts, commuters face increased delays, and churches and public buildings have been damaged. If the Minister does not support the motion, will she explain to the House why not? I genuinely hope, however, that she does and that she drafts measures in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill in a different way. I will even forget the fact that her party voted against the amendment in the other place. I urge her to support such proposals, and she will receive a great cheer from the House when she does.</p>

	<p pid="b.270.0/1">I congratulate the Backbench Business Committee on securing a debate on an issue that rightly concerns all of us. I congratulate the hon. Members for Hyndburn (Graham Jones), for Dudley South (Chris Kelly) and for Worcester (Mr Walker) on tabling the motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/2">Metal theft is a crime that affects us all and strikes at the very heart of our communities. As we have heard from Members on both sides of the House, it is a dreadful crime. They have painted a thoroughly depressing picture of the mentality of those who would desecrate churches and commit theft&#8212;whole brass bands gone and a building having to be demolished because of the amount of metal taken from it. There were really horrible stories from every constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/3">The consequences are there for all to see, not least the loss and disruption to telecommunications, as every hon. Member mentioned&#8212;I am not going to go over</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/4">everything that was said, as more than 22 contributions were made&#8212;as well as to electricity and transport networks, and the damage to our religious and heritage sites. There were horrific stories right across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/5">We are not prepared to stand by and see our infrastructure and heritage destroyed, which is why the Government are taking the problem of metal theft so seriously and taking action. We are clear that the only sustainable, long-term solution is legislation, but we are equally clear that legislation alone is not enough. That is why we propose a coherent package of measures to tackle metal theft. We want to cut out the easy, anonymous reward for metal thieves by banning cash payments for scrap metal and making it much harder for illegitimate dealers to trade in stolen metals by introducing a more rigorous licensing scheme, which many Members across the House have called for. We want to deter thieves and illegal metal dealers by introducing more focused and sustained enforcement and tougher penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/6">To those who say that the Government are not going far enough or fast enough, I say that we are going as fast as we possibly can. Metal theft is a horrific crime, and the Government are stepping forward to take action. Two weeks ago the Home Secretary announced to Parliament the legislative action we will take as part of our package of measures. We will increase the fines for all offences in the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964&#8212;the maximum fine will be unlimited&#8212;which will strengthen the deterrent and improve industry compliance with the current registration scheme. We will also create a new criminal offence in order to prohibit cash payments for the purchase of scrap metal. That has been welcomed on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/7">Prohibiting cash from an entire sector is a bold step, but cash transactions for scrap metal are often completed without any proof of personal identification or that the individual legitimately owns the goods being sold. This leads to anonymous transactions that create such a low risk for criminal activity that we have seen this epidemic across our country. Requiring transactions to be completed with traceable payments will dramatically improve the ability of the police and local authorities to enforce the existing registration scheme. The widespread use of cash, coupled with lax record keeping, also creates easy opportunities for tax avoidance. We will work constructively with the British Metals Recycling Association on how his measure will operate in practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/8">The legislative changes to increase fines and ban cash payments will be made through Government amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. This is the quickest and most practical way that we can get these measures into law and crack down on metal theft. Members across the House have made it perfectly clear tonight that the House wants us to go further, but let me stress that we need realistic, achievable and effective legislative measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.271.1/1">I will not, as I am really short of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/2">That is why we took the difficult decision not to support the private Member&#8217;s Bill proposed by the hon. Member for Hyndburn.

	<p pid="b.272.1/1">I am sorry, but I really want to make some particular points. If I have a minute at the end I will give way. Members have been asking all evening for me to answer the points raised, and I intend to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/2">Strong legislation is absolutely vital, but it must be backed up by strong enforcement action from the police and other law enforcement agencies. We are working with the Association of Chief Police Officers, local police forces and the British Transport police to strengthen law enforcement activity. Recognising the damage that metal theft causes to our economy, the Government have committed &#163;5 million of additional funding to establish a dedicated national metal theft task force. The taskforce will complement and expand existing enforcement activity not only by the police, but by a range of law enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/3">The message we are sending out is clear: metal thieves will have nowhere to hide. We have recently seen some significant sentences given to metal thieves, which I hope will continue. I welcome the recent announcement by Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, in which he instructed prosecutors to use every tool at their disposal to take a firm stand to convict metal thieves. I make it clear that we are in no way targeting the legitimate metal recycling industry, which does important work that is good for our economy and good for our environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/4">Many Members on both sides of the House asked about a number of measures, and the Government believe that the measures that we have already announced will make a big difference, but we are open to new ideas and are already considering how we can further strengthen our approach to metal theft, including the proposals outlined in the motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/5">We are considering, for example, how the existing registration scheme can be strengthened, with a robust licensing scheme for scrap metal dealers to replace the current registration scheme, and we agree that the existing scheme under the Scrap Metal Dealers Act is outdated and in need of improvement. The Home Office is already seeking to make such changes as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/6">On greater police powers, which Members on both sides have asked for, we are keen to provide the police with sufficient powers, including entry and closure powers covering the scrap metal industry, to tackle metal theft offenders, and we are seeking clarity on whether we can include amendments to police powers of entry as part of wider measures in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/7">We want to regularise the position under the 1964 Act, whereby the police have the power to enter yards that are registered under the Act, because, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase> said, their inability to go into unregistered yards is a real anomaly. In the meantime, the work of the dedicated metal theft task force, along with unlimited fines and the end of cash transactions, will tackle the problem until we can bring all those powers into being.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/8">Any new scheme must support legal operators and promote the green economy, but it must also have the power to tackle scrap metal dealers who wilfully help</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/9">the stolen metal trade, so we will consider further measures, listen to the outcome of the debate and see whether there is more we can practically do to stop metal theft. I shall now give way to the hon. Member for Hyndburn, but I hope that Members appreciate that they did ask for an answer to these questions, and I have been trying to give them one.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.1/2">We are strengthening the law, cracking down on rogue scrap dealers and targeting the criminals who supply them. That is the right way to tackle this devastating crime. That is what this Government are doing, and this Government are taking action. Nothing happened during the previous 13 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.2/1">First, I welcome the Minister&#8217;s words, because we are beginning to move in the right direction. We still have some outstanding issues, including whether the Government are going to be robust enough, but we have heard everybody&#8217;s comments tonight, and we in the plural sense&#8212;the public, Members and those in the other place&#8212;want to see tough action, so that is a key question for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.2/2">Secondly, on the point about timing, Members want to see measures introduced as soon as possible, and one key issue for many Members is the fact that we have the summer recess coming up and the Queen&#8217;s speech, so legislation needs to come forward. We also have the Olympic games, and, to cite again the words I mentioned earlier, we are not far from a national catastrophe. Paul Crowther from the British Transport police said that the issue is second only to terrorism, so urgency is key in this issue, and many people both nationally and locally feel that way.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.4/2">I am grateful to Members for being here tonight in such numbers in order to express their opinion on the need to act on metal theft. The Government need not just to look at the timetable and to bring forward legislation as soon as they can; they need to go beyond legislation. We need to consider being far more proactive, so I am very grateful for Members&#8217; contributions this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.2/1">I sought this Adjournment debate in an attempt to highlight a most serious situation facing the nation&#8217;s schools&#8212;the presence of asbestos in many school buildings and the risk of exposure to it among pupils and workers alike. I say at the outset that in no way am I looking to score political points. I hope that my views, comments and questions in this debate will attract cross-party support.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/2">Of the 33,600 schools in Britain, the Department for Education has estimated that more than 75% contain asbestos. Some 14,000 schools were built after the second world war, and almost all those built before 1975 contain asbestos. Schools refurbished during that period are also likely to contain it.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/3">Exposure to asbestos fibres, even at low levels, can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma, which is a cancer affecting the lining of the lung. We should not be complacent about the presence of those dust fibres and the effects that it can have on an individual&#8217;s life. It is estimated that more than 4,000 people a year die as a result of exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma has a lengthy latency period, which simply means that the condition may not surface for perhaps 20, 30 or even 40 or 50 years following exposure. However, once the disease is diagnosed, it is largely fatal, with most victims dying within 18 months of diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/4">Does the Minister agree that the Government&#8217;s policy should be the phased removal of all asbestos from schools, with priority being given to those schools where the asbestos is in the worst condition or considered to be the most dangerous or damaged?</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/5">Exposure to asbestos in schools is endangering the lives of tens of thousands of schoolchildren and teachers, many of whom are completely unaware of their daily exposure. It has continued for generations, and year after year, individuals diagnosed with lung cancer, mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases are puzzled about the whereabouts of their exposure. In many cases, it happened while they were at school.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/6">More than 140 school teachers have died from mesothelioma in the past 10 years. Disturbingly, figures relating to other school workers, such as cleaners and administration staff, and relating to the number of children who have died as a result of exposure, are unknown. Children are likely to be particularly vulnerable to asbestos exposure, because their lungs are still developing. If we use the ratio calculation used in the US, which is that for every teacher who dies nine children will die, that translates into the alarming statistic of 100 people dying each year here in the UK as a result of exposure at school.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/7">The materials of greatest concern are those that readily release asbestos fibres into the environment. Many people mistakenly believe that those fibres are confined to asbestos lagging, sprayed asbestos and asbestos insulating boards, but that is not the case. Asbestos was commonly used to spray ceilings and structural beams,</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/8">and extensively used in wall constructions and many other areas that are vulnerable to damage and disturbance by the school population on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.2/9">Does the Minister agree that by law, all schools should be required to carry out a thorough asbestos survey, which should include air tests and detailed independent inspections? Will immediate consideration be given to that?</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">I fully endorse the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments. In 2004, the Northern Ireland Assembly took a decision to undertake asbestos tests in all schools and to have it removed, and such decisions have been taken in other regions of the UK. Does that not reinforce his point that it is now up to England to follow suit?</p>

	<p pid="b.278.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining this debate.

It is important that that identification is done as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. One of the big problems&#8212;I will come on to this&#8212;is that many different types of asbestos are unidentified in the school buildings. People are very unaware of where and what it is. If we are not going to remove the asbestos immediately, how we manage it over that period is very important.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/2">A report commissioned by the Medical Research Council concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/3">&#8220;It is not unreasonable to assume&#8230;that the entire school population has been exposed to asbestos in school buildings&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/4">Furthermore, the MRC report assessed lifetime asbestos exposure levels and it concluded that even in schools where the asbestos is in a good condition, the everyday background asbestos fibre levels are five to 500 times greater than outdoor levels. To try and put that into some context, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council defines &#8220;significant exposure&#8221; as</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/5">&#8220;a level above that commonly found in the air in buildings and the general outdoor environment&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/6">and states that that an exposure above that level would materially increase the risk of mesothelioma developing.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/7">According to leading experts, the frightening reality of asbestos exposure is that that there is no known threshold below which there is no risk. Even the most common of classroom activities can release dangerous fibres. That can be something as simple as slamming the door five times, which could release levels of amosite fibres more than 600 times greater than outdoor levels. That action routinely occurs in Britain&#8217;s schools on a daily basis. There are even simpler reasons for fibre release in classrooms, such as placing drawing pins in the wall and removing books from the book shelf. They are daily occurrences, too, in every school in the UK, and that is why I sought this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/8">If the respected experts are correct&#8212;as of yet, there has been little opposition to their findings&#8212;children and school staff are being exposed considerably day in, day out, which is deeply concerning. Will the Minister consider the introduction of a national audit of the extent and condition of asbestos in schools, in which the data should be centrally collated and open to public scrutiny?</p>
	<p pid="b.278.3/9">The exposure to the lethal fibres on such a scale means that people are dying from the asbestos-related disease mesothelioma. We all agree that to do nothing is not an option&#8212;or should I say that I hope that we all agree? Fresh action is needed urgently.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman and congratulate him on securing this very important debate. Will he join me in congratulating the Department for Education for making movements on training packages for staff? I hope that he will agree that we must go much further to ensure that staff are trained to cover the problems caused by drawing pins in walls. Does he further agree that if parents have any inkling that the age of the building is such that it might contain asbestos, when they visit the school they should ask where its asbestos management plan is?</p>

	<p pid="b.279.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a number of very important points, which I hope to clarify in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.1/2">The current system is difficult to remedy and, as such, Government policy is to manage the asbestos in schools and try to reduce the exposure incidence. So long as the asbestos is in good condition and is unlikely to be disturbed, it is thought that managing the asbestos in a prescribed manner is preferential to its removal.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Laurence Jackson school in Guisburough in my constituency, built at the time of the Macmillan Government, has about six or seven boilers whose piping is lagged with asbestos. Due to the antiquated boiler system, constant work is needed, meaning that the pipes are constantly being interfered with, increasing the likelihood of asbestos contamination. The school has a plan, but its capital requirement for dealing with the ongoing situation is only about &#163;25,000. The likelihood of asbestos contamination increases every time the system is tampered with. Would he not say that even schools that have a plan can get into tricky situations like that?</p>

	<p pid="b.279.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. That is one reason why we can no longer agree to leave asbestos in schools virtually until they are knocked down. We need a strategy in place for the immediate phased removal of asbestos. Yes, it will take time, but we need a strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.4/1">I am delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman say that phased removal is the right strategy for the long term. Does he agree that most parents understand that it cannot all be done at once, but that there is nothing to fear from sharing information more publicly so that there is more pressure from parents and more knowledge from schools</p>
	<p pid="b.279.4/2">about what they need to do in the meantime to mitigate the problem properly rather than to deal with it inadequately until phased removal is possible?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.280.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" speakername="Ian Lavery" colnum="280"  time="022:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001713">
	<p pid="b.280.0/1">I accept that point, and I will come to it in my contribution. It is extremely important that parents and everyone involved in schools understand exactly what the management plans are, and understand everything relating to asbestos presence in the school building.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/2">The problem at the moment is that we have the worst of both worlds. Asbestos is not being removed due to cuts to the schools refurbishment programme, but at the same time, it is not being managed properly. Effective asbestos management systems must be put in place and registered and monitored accurately, asbestos-containing materials must be clearly identified and marked, regular independent inspections must take place and defects must be repaired immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/3">Does the Minister agree that children should have the same rights as adults in an asbestos environment? Those rights could reasonably be exercised through parents, guardians and teachers. In addition, does he agree that schools should be treated as special places, as they are in other countries? Children&#8217;s special vulnerability to asbestos should be recognised in asbestos management procedures. Most importantly, does the Minister accept that the details of asbestos incidents in schools need to be collated centrally and open to public and internal scrutiny, so that the effectiveness of Health and Safety Executive, Department for Education and local authority asbestos management policies can be assessed?</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/4">A recent report by the Asbestos Testing and Consultancy Association was critical of many schools. The report criticised ineffective and at times dangerous asbestos management systems. ATAC expressed the view that school systems&#8217; failures are not minor in the main, but fundamental, serious and endemic in schools across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/5">If, as is likely, Government policy is to be maintained&#8212;that is to say, if the problem of asbestos is to be managed&#8212;then managed it must be. A well-trained work force are essential, as is a culture of openness with parents, pupils and teachers. Quality training of head teachers, teachers, school governors and others expected to manage asbestos is a must. All staff should be adequately trained in asbestos awareness so that any actions that might disturb asbestos fibres can be prevented. Also, instructions should be given to children to ensure that any disturbance is avoided.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/6">If any management system is to work efficiently, individuals must be up to the job. Those tasked with managing the system must clearly understand their role and responsibilities under the current law. That is not happening at the moment, although some local authorities are better than others. However, the Secretary of State for Education recently announced that he proposes to move responsibility for health and safety in schools away from local authorities and give it to individual schools. That will make good and effective management even more unlikely. Will the Minister confirm that such training is adequately funded and will continue as long as management systems are in place? Furthermore, will he comment on the notion that standards in asbestos training should be set and that training should be mandatory? Will he recommend that the Department</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/7">for Education and the HSE jointly develop asbestos guidance specifically for schools and that current standards be reviewed?</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/8">We have a huge problem with openness. The presence and incidence of asbestos fibre release is often played down. It is accurate to suggest that many parents are wholly unaware and not informed of the presence of asbestos in their children&#8217;s place of education. A recent survey showed that at least half of school staff were not informed of the problem either. Will the Minister demand a policy of openness and complete transparency about asbestos in schools? Does he agree that parents and teachers should have a right to know what asbestos is present in their and their children&#8217;s school, and does he accept that parents, teachers and support staff should be annually updated on the presence of asbestos in their schools and on the measures being taken to manage it?</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/9">In conclusion, this issue has often been seen by successive Governments as too big to handle. It is crystal clear that there are serious concerns about how asbestos is managed in schools. The longer the issue remains unaddressed, the more people will be exposed, increasing the cost to be picked up by future generations, as has happened in past decades. The Government and other interested experts should work together to ensure greater co-ordination, aiming at the complete eradication of asbestos fibres in our schools. Children, parents and staff should feel totally comfortable in the school environment and free from potential harm. Will the Minister agree to revisit this issue as a matter of great urgency, and take up the cudgels and introduce a detailed programme to secure our nation&#8217;s prized assets&#8212;our children&#8212;from this killer fibre?</p>

	<p pid="b.281.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian Lavery">the hon. Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I know that he is passionate about this subject, having campaigned for victims of asbestos-related lung conditions and pleural plaques in the north-east and in his role as secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on health and safety. I have read its report, &#8220;Asbestos in Schools: the need for action&#8221;, very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/2">The priority for this Government, as for the previous Government, is to ensure the safety of staff and pupils in schools. The report is welcome in raising awareness of the asbestos issue and makes several important recommendations, which I will address, as I will the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions. The Government&#8217;s policy remains consistent with that of the previous Administration. The Health and Safety Executive advice is clear. If asbestos is in good condition and not disturbed or damaged, it is safer to leave and manage it in place than to remove it. In the view of the HSE, removing it would involve a far greater risk to school children, staff and contractors than managing it until the eventual demolition of the building.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/3">The Department for Education and the HSE are proactive in promoting good asbestos management in schools. To oversee this important work, my noble Friend Lord Hill, the Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for schools, established the asbestos in</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/4">schools steering group, which is chaired by the Department and has a membership that includes my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, trade unions, campaigners, the HSE and Partnership for Schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/5">Under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006, responsibility for complying with asbestos legislation lies with those responsible for the maintenance or repair of non-domestic premises. For most state schools that will be the local authority, not the school itself, but where budgets for building management are delegated to schools by the local authority, the duty&#8212;as it is called&#8212;to manage asbestos will be shared between schools and the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.282.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman explain what would happen with the newly introduced free schools? Who would be responsible for the management plan and for ridding those schools of asbestos?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.282.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="282"  time="022:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001716">
	<p pid="b.282.1/1">The duty to manage is the duty of the employer. In academies and free schools, that would be either the governing body or the academy trust. However, I will write to the hon. Gentleman shortly to ensure that I am correct on the technical question of who, precisely, is the employer in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.1/2">There is a need for head teachers and governors to be aware of their responsibilities when commissioning building or maintenance work. Duty holders should have already taken steps to identify whether asbestos is present in their buildings and assessed the condition of the asbestos, and should have access to records of that information. The duty holder also needs to assess and manage risks to ensure that people are not exposed to asbestos fibres. If the asbestos-containing material is deteriorating or subject to damage, remedial measures will be required. The HSE guidance on the 2006 regulations gives schools clear procedures to follow in assessing the risk from asbestos. The guidance requires assessment of the location, type and condition of the asbestos-containing material, and it is the duty of schools and local authorities to take the appropriate measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.1/3">The Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" name="Chris Grayling">the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, who has responsibility for employment, has set out the Government&#8217;s plans for reform of the health and safety system in Britain in the document &#8220;Good Health and Safety, Good for Everyone&#8221;. The proposals make it clear that there is a need to focus attention on the highest risks. As a result, the HSE will not routinely inspect local authority-maintained schools. However, managing asbestos needs effective and ongoing attention from duty holders. The HSE&#8217;s recent inspection initiatives of schools under local authority control and those outside it, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, found that the majority were adequately managing asbestos, but a proportion fell below acceptable standards. The findings of those inspections have been published, so that all schools can review their asbestos management in areas where common weaknesses were identified. The HSE is also gathering intelligence to see whether further inspections of schools are necessary. If so, the HSE will monitor the duty to manage asbestos requirements through a series of inspections in 2013-14 to ensure that the HSE&#8217;s guidance and the findings of its recent inspection initiatives are properly implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.283.0/1">Very briefly, what proportion of schools fell below the standards?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-02-07b.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="283"  time="022:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120207/debtext/120207-0004.htm#12020793001718">
	<p pid="b.283.1/1">I do not know the proportion that fell below the acceptable standards, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman shortly with the precise figure from the HSE.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/2">Everyone in the education sector has a role to play in raising and maintaining awareness. Where duty holders fall below acceptable standards, HSE inspectors will continue to take action, and they have robust procedures in place to enforce regulations. The Department and the HSE have put in place clear guidance for schools and local authorities to help them identify and manage the risks posed by asbestos. We are currently producing an asbestos awareness training website, containing online training packages for head teachers and governors, and teaching and support staff, as well as premises and caretaking staff. In addition to training, the website will allow schools and local authorities to share good practice and documentation on asbestos management. The head teacher&#8217;s course is undergoing trials and will be released later this year. We do not propose to make the training mandatory, as we do not want to impose one particular model where good practice may already be in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/3">Another recommendation in the report, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, was that data about the extent, type and condition of asbestos should be collected by central Government. There is a need to maintain a register of asbestos surveys at local authority level, but we do not see the need for a national register of asbestos surveys of public buildings in England and Wales. It would result in the unnecessary duplication of the records that local authorities and other employers are required by law to keep, and the need to maintain two sets of identical data would increase bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/4">Another recommendation in the report was that a system should be introduced so that parents and school staff could be regularly informed about the presence of asbestos and how it was being managed. A similar</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/5">system is in place in the United States. We encourage a policy of openness, but it is for duty holders to determine which information to share with parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/6">On the issue of proactively removing all asbestos, the HSE&#8217;s advice is clear. Removing all asbestos when a risk assessment has determined that that is not necessary is considered more dangerous to those removing it and to the building&#8217;s occupants than leaving it undisturbed. If the control of asbestos regulations are followed and asbestos surveys and management plans are put into effect, with periodic checks on the condition of any asbestos, the expert advice is that this will result in no significant exposure to asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/7">The Government take very seriously the issue of managing the problem of asbestos in our schools. As the all-party group&#8217;s report makes clear, the majority of schools contain asbestos-containing materials, as do many other buildings, both domestic and non-domestic. The asbestos in schools steering group, established by my noble Friend Lord Hill, has asked the committee on carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment to look into the relative vulnerability of children to even low-level exposure to asbestos fibres. I have taken on board the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about the exposure of children to asbestos. This will be the first such assessment, as previous assessments have been for adults exposed to high exposure levels. We will review our policy on asbestos management and our advice to schools when we receive the committee&#8217;s report later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/8">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue. I hope that he will be reassured that the Government are taking it very seriously. As previous Governments have done, we are following the expert advice of the Health and Safety Executive in formulating policy and managing safely the asbestos in school buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/10" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
